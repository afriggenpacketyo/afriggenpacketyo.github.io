        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the tragic death of their brother, Michael Barnard, from carbon monoxide poisoning due to a leaking exhaust in his car, Lucy and Rebecca Barnard are campaigning for legislation requiring carbon monoxide detectors in all UK vehicles. Michael, 36, was found dead in August 2023 after unknowingly driving for weeks while being slowly poisoned by the deadly gas. The sisters have launched a petition to raise awareness of the dangers of carbon monoxide, a 'silent killer' responsible for approximately 60 deaths annually in the UK. They hope that their efforts will prevent similar tragedies and ensure that even if their campaign saves one life, it would be a success.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions following an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir, India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, as announced by Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. The agreement was mediated by the United States, with President Trump initially announcing the ceasefire on social media and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming the efforts. Prior to the agreement, Indian officials reported attacks by Pakistan across 26 locations and troop movements into forward areas, while denying any damage to India's military infrastructure from Pakistani strikes. Tensions escalated after an April attack on Hindu tourists, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, to demonstrate Europe's commitment to Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. The leaders pledged to intensify pressure on Russia to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire and discussed ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Ukraine and its allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday.

          <p>Recent equipment failures at a Philadelphia air traffic control facility, which guides planes to and from Newark Liberty International Airport, have exposed the strain on the U.S. air traffic control system due to staffing shortages and aging infrastructure. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace dated radar and communications systems across U.S. airspace, an overhaul that airlines estimate could require Congress to approve more than $30 billion in funding. The FAA is taking steps to beef up staffing and install backup systems, but the incidents have raised concerns about the safety and efficiency of air travel, particularly in the busy New York City area.</p>

Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at the Delaney Hall U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center and charged with trespassing, while visiting the facility with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation.

          <p>A deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir led to escalating tensions and military conflict between India and Pakistan, with both countries exchanging missile and drone strikes. The rivalry, rooted in the disputed Kashmir region, has a long history of wars and cross-border fire. The countries agreed to a ceasefire after U.S.-led mediation talks, with President Trump announcing the agreement. The conflict stems from the partition of India in 1947 and ongoing disputes over the Kashmir region, which both nations claim in its entirety.</p>

The discovery challenges previous assumptions about Neanderthal technological capabilities, suggesting they developed advanced bone-working techniques independently of Homo sapiens. The spear tip, found in the Mezmaiskaya Cave, shows signs of craftsmanship and successful use as a hunting weapon. The scarcity of Neanderthal bone tools may be due to decay over time, without specific environmental conditions to preserve them.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency, including his meme coin $TRUMP, is creating conflicts of interest that are hindering the passage of crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act due to concerns that Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures have created an unprecedented conflict of interest. Democrats are calling for investigations into Trump-linked coins and demanding financial records from World Liberty Financial. The president's pursuit of personal profits is creating a major impediment to long-awaited advancements and could have an impact on hopes for other legislative achievements and deregulation efforts as well as the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region lifted an order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The blaze, which originated at a swimming pool cleaning products firm in Vilanova i la Geltrú, prompted officials to urge residents to remain indoors as a precaution. Fire services successfully stabilized the fire and monitored the area for toxic levels, with no casualties reported. The warehouse owner suggested that a lithium battery may have caused the blaze.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Employers are increasingly hiring part-time workers to avoid paying benefits and to utilize just-in-time scheduling, leaving many Americans with inconsistent hours and unstable incomes. This trend circumvents the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), which set limits on work but not a floor, leading to underwork and economic instability for low-wage workers. Congress could address this by requiring advanced scheduling, incentivizing full-time hiring, or allowing workers to choose their desired work status. Without policy changes, this trend could extend beyond low-wage jobs, impacting even professional sectors.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is claiming a victory after the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV) temporarily paused its reclassification of the party as 'confirmed right-wing extremist' due to a lawsuit. Despite the AfD's claim that the BfV has 'withdrawn' the classification, this is false; the BfV is merely pausing the designation to allow the court time for review. The classification 'confirmed right-wing extremist' was not withdrawn, and the BfV considers its classification to be correct. The AfD applied to the court to issue an injunction order if the BfV were to reject the “standstill” order.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit after a rocket booster malfunctioned, serving as a reminder of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration efforts. During the space race, putting boots on the moon was the biggest prize — but the other worlds in our solar system were calling, too. The event highlights the Soviet Union's Venera program, which achieved several milestones in Venus exploration, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from its surface.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has implemented a strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, using economic tools to counter foreign pressure. This involves increasing exports, directing state-controlled banks to lend to industrial borrowers, and imposing export restrictions on critical minerals. While the strategy has strengthened China's position, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and comes at a cost to Chinese households. This article is about political strategy and does not contain any financial recommendations.</p>

Baldoni claims Swift was present at a script discussion in 2023, acting as one of Lively's 'dragons'.

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is using a unique rookie minicamp approach, focusing on individual drills rather than 11-on-11 periods to evaluate talent. The goal is to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their pure talent, with the coaching staff teaching and evaluating drills specific to the Chargers' scheme. Harbaugh aims to 'mine for gold' by identifying hidden gems among the undrafted free agents and tryout players. The rookies who pass the three-day minicamp will join veterans during next week’s organized team activities.</p>
