        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan plans to eliminate another 11,000 jobs globally and close seven factories due to declining sales in key markets like China and the U.S. This decision follows a previous announcement of 9,000 job cuts in November. A proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi also failed earlier in the year. The company reported a significant annual loss, further exacerbated by tariffs, and refrained from providing income forecasts due to the uncertain nature of U.S. tariff measures, with the company's CEO calling the previous year a 'wake-up call'.</p>

          <p>The Chinese navy has successfully integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into a combat-readiness exercise for warship degaussing, or magnetic immunisation. The integration of AI increased the efficiency of the degaussing process by 60%, potentially boosting the stealth capacity and survivability of China's expanding submarine fleet, according to state media reports. The simulated emergency drill marked the first operational deployment of an AI-assisted decision-making system, enhancing performance far beyond traditional manual methods.

          <p>Amidst fluctuating tariff policies, consumers can take steps to mitigate the impact on their budgets by looking for sales events like Memorial Day and Father's Day, and by checking the origin of products to identify items less affected by tariffs. Shoppers should also consider purchasing domestic products, particularly produce, to avoid potential price hikes on imports from countries like Mexico. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consumers should strategically plan purchases of these items, but avoid panic buying. These are some of the tips to consider to navigate the current trade landscape.</p>

Economists anticipate a slight cooldown in inflation, despite earlier concerns about potential price surges due to tariff escalations. Trump has eased tariffs significantly since the initial announcement, including temporarily reducing tariffs on China. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that sustained tariff increases could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.
