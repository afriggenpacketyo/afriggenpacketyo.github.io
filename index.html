          <h2>UK Government Proposes New Law to Target Mass Attack Plotters Without Ideological Motives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 20:07:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass casualty attacks by individuals who lack a clear ideological motive. The proposed legislation would empower police to intervene and charge suspects for plotting attacks, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws, closing a legal gap highlighted by the Southport attack. This change would allow authorities to take preparatory actions, such as researching a target, as seriously as they would for terrorism-related offenses. The move is a response to the growing threat of violence-fixated individuals who may be radicalized online without adhering to a specific terrorist ideology.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gave shortstop Mookie Betts an unplanned day off to help him mentally reset from a persistent and uncharacteristic season-long slump. Despite hopes that the All-Star break would rejuvenate him, Betts's performance has not improved, with his batting average and OPS falling to career-worst levels. Roberts emphasized the decision was made to take the pressure off Betts, allowing him to observe a game from a different perspective. The move underscores the team's concern over the superstar's struggles at the plate, which have been a significant issue for the Dodgers this summer.</p>

          <p>A knife attack at a large outdoor rave in Portland, Oregon, left four teenagers wounded early Saturday morning. The incident occurred during a disturbance within the crowd of hundreds gathered at the Eastbank Esplanade. According to police, all four victims were conscious at the scene, with two sustaining serious injuries and two minor ones. One of the injured men was detained by police as part of the investigation, and authorities are not currently seeking other suspects. Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward, as many people left the scene without speaking to investigators.</p>

          <p>At least 32 Palestinians were killed and dozens more were wounded after Israeli troops opened fire on crowds seeking food in southern Gaza. The incidents occurred near distribution centers operated by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an alternative to U.N. aid channels. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached their position overnight when the site was closed. The event highlights the dire humanitarian crisis and the extreme dangers civilians face when attempting to access desperately needed aid supplies.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during a sweep of an encampment. The lawsuit alleges that city workers acted negligently by failing to check if tents were occupied before clearing the area in preparation for a holiday weekend. Taylor's death has sparked outrage among advocates, who criticize the city's approach to homelessness amid an affordable housing crisis. The family is seeking unspecified damages and calling for more humane treatment of the city's unhoused population.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against the Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch.

The suit claims the report was false and defamatory, representing significant journalistic failures. This legal action comes as Trump faces pressure to disclose more about his past association with Epstein, who died while facing sex trafficking charges.</p>

          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as snus, is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some teens using products containing dangerously high levels of nicotine. These smokeless pouches are sold without age restrictions, leading to concerns from health officials and parents about addiction and oral health risks like severe gum damage. While considered less harmful than smoking, the lack of regulation on nicotine strength and marketing has made them popular. A proposed government bill aims to make it illegal to sell these products to individuals under 18 to curb the trend.</p>

This behavior highlights public frustration with what many perceive as exorbitant "kiss-and-fly" charges for a basic service.

Ukrainian teachers have been replaced by Russian educators, and children are taught a version of history that justifies the invasion.

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether the traditional six-week school summer holiday should be shortened and redistributed throughout the year. Proponents argue a shorter break could help close the learning gap for disadvantaged children, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and potentially lower holiday costs. However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan, while some worry it could concentrate holiday demand and drive prices even higher. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the school calendar in response to modern societal and economic pressures.</p>

University enrollments for Chinese language studies have dropped sharply in the United States and Britain, with similar trends seen at the secondary school level in countries like New Zealand. This waning interest is attributed to a combination of factors, including geopolitical tensions, concerns over China's human rights record, and the practical difficulties of learning the language. The shift marks a notable reversal after years of rapid growth fueled by China's economic rise.</p>

          <p>Oleksandr Usyk has become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion after a dominant performance against Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium. The Ukrainian fighter stopped the British challenger in the fifth round, having knocked him down twice in the same round to secure the victory. With this win, Usyk reclaimed the IBF title that was previously stripped from him and added it to his WBA, WBO, and WBC belts, extending his undefeated professional record to 24-0. The fight solidified Usyk's status as one of the era's greatest boxers in front of a massive crowd.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before being promoted to his advisory role. His departure is part of a broader staffing shakeup within Hegseth's office following a scandal involving the leak of sensitive military plans on the Signal messaging app earlier this year. The Pentagon confirmed his exit, thanking him for his service, while Fulcher released a statement saying his planned six months of service were complete.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has placed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to terminate a key partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions to limit flights at Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. claims violates a bilateral trade agreement and unfairly benefits Mexican carriers. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. This escalation in the trade dispute could significantly impact the travel industry, as Mexico is the top international destination for American travelers.</p>

While the hitmen are serving life sentences, the suspected mastermind, Mohammed Ali Ege, escaped custody in India and remains one of Europe's most wanted men.

          <p>Rory McIlroy shot a 66 in the third round of The Open, keeping his hopes for a late title challenge alive despite a bizarre moment on the 11th hole. While hitting from the rough, his club struck a buried golf ball, causing his shot to fall short and leading to a bogey. However, he immediately recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole, thrilling the supportive home crowd at Portrush. Finishing the day at eight under par, McIlroy acknowledged he is six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler but feels he has given himself "half a chance" for Sunday's final round.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are deepening their cooperation, forming a trilateral alliance known as the "E3" to address pressing security challenges. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, focusing on security and defense cooperation, including mutual assistance obligations. This pivot towards European partners is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the United States' commitment to NATO under a potential Trump presidency. The alliance aims to bolster European defense capabilities, with the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK playing a key role.</p>

In one case, a man with a documented personality disorder was deemed fit for service, raising concerns from his family and advocates that he could be a danger to himself and his unit. Human rights officials have received thousands of complaints about draft violations, with lawyers noting that gaps in medical data systems and cursory examinations contribute to the problem.

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to joining FC Barcelona after a deal in principle was reached for a loan move with an option to buy. The 27-year-old England international has been an outcast at Old Trafford, having not played for the club since being dropped by manager Ruben Amorim in December. For Barcelona, the move addresses their need for a left-sided attacker after failing to sign other targets, and the loan structure is financially advantageous. The transfer is a pivotal moment for Rashford, offering a chance to revitalize his career at another of the world's top clubs.</p>
