          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran between August 2024 and February 2025. The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command led the investigation, describing it as complex and fast-moving. The men were arrested on May 3 and have been remanded in custody, scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court. This case highlights ongoing concerns about foreign interference and the UK's efforts to counter such activities through its national security legislation.</p>

          <p>Nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in the town of Bilopillia, Sumy region, near the Russian border, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack, described by Ukraine's national police as a cynical war crime, occurred hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey. The talks did not yield a breakthrough, though an agreement was reached to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war from each side. This incident underscores the ongoing violence and challenges in achieving a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary in March, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has refused to communicate with South Korea, a sign of deteriorating relations between the two countries. Experts suggest that Pyongyang's silence reflects its displeasure with Seoul's hard-line policies and the now impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The fishermen's fate remains uncertain, pending improved relations or a change of heart, highlighting the complex dynamics of inter-Korean relations.</p>

The Knicks dominated the game, especially in the second quarter, and will now face the Indiana Pacers in a seven-game series for a spot in the NBA finals.

          <p>A new genetic study published in Science traces the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, helping underrepresented Indigenous groups understand their ancestral origins. Researchers found that early settlers split into groups isolated by environmental barriers like the Amazon rainforest and Andes mountain range. The findings provide crucial insights into the history, migration, and adaptation of Indigenous communities and highlight the importance of preserving their cultural heritage.</p>

The inmates created a hole in a cell wall and exited through a loading dock before scaling the perimeter wall. Sheriff Susan Hutson suspects internal assistance due to defective locks and doors. Three escapees have been apprehended, including Kendell Myles, found hiding beneath a car in the French Quarter.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that some Trump supporters interpreted as a veiled threat against President Donald Trump's life. The post showed seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some saw as a call to assassinate the 47th president. Comey said he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation. This incident underscores the ongoing contentious relationship between Trump and Comey.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about his mental acuity, months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed struggles with memory and speech. In response to questions about the report, Biden asserted his competence and dismissed the need for Hur's recommendation. The report amplified pressure from Republicans who questioned Biden's fitness to serve, leading to his withdrawal from the presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat by Trump.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, reducing visibility to near zero and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city.

The event was described as "something out of the history books" by residents, highlighting the unusual and disruptive nature of the weather phenomenon. The skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, but the storm left a lasting impression.</p>

Prosecutors aim to prove Combs masterminded a criminal enterprise, using his network to cover up alleged crimes. The defense concedes abuse but argues it does not equate to sex trafficking.

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions. In Saudi Arabia, he announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria and received a standing ovation, while in Qatar and the UAE, he secured investment pledges and was awarded the country's highest civilian honor. The trip underscored Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy and the warm reception he receives in the Gulf, where leaders prioritize business deals over human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, face potential ruin due to tariffs imposed by President Trump, impacting their largest market, the United States. The tariffs, initially announced at 35% and later revised to 10%, jeopardize exports and expansion plans for companies like Ginex, which makes ignition devices for ammunition. The mayor of Gorazde expressed concern over the abandonment of free trade as a path to peace, while Bosnia's trade minister showed little interest in saving the ammunition companies. This situation highlights the unintended consequences of broad tariff policies on small economies.</p>
