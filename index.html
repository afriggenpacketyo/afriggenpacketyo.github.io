        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A divided appeals court ruled in favor of a 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified as Cristian, who sought to return to the United States after being deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a previous order directing the Trump administration to facilitate his return, stating that his removal violated a class-action settlement protecting unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. The judges in the majority criticized the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act and argued that the government would not be irreparably harmed by facilitating Cristian's return, as his asylum application was not adjudicated fairly. The dissenting judge argued that the district court exceeded its authority and that Cristian's asylum application would likely be denied anyway.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the use of AI to create fake images. First Lady Melania Trump, who advocated for the bill, symbolically signed it as well, emphasizing the need to protect children from weaponized technologies that can affect emotions and be deadly. The law makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites to remove such material within 48 hours. While supporters hail it as a victory for online safety, critics argue it could lead to censorship of legitimate images and government monitoring of private communications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, has dismissed the federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation. Habba stated that the decision was made to move forward, and she invited Baraka to tour the facility, addressing his criticism of the facility housing migrants without proper permits. Baraka, who is running for governor, has been a vocal critic of the ICE facility, arguing that it is dangerous and illegal, but the Department of Homeland Security denies these claims. Habba said the dismissal against the mayor is not the end of this matter.</p>

The incident has raised tensions ahead of the upcoming Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, where eyes will be on Dillon and Smith to see if there's any further conflict.

The FBI stated that Bartkus was not previously on their radar, and the attack marked the largest bombing ever investigated in Southern California.

          <p>Michelle Goldberg writes about the Heritage Foundation's Project Esther, a campaign aimed at combating the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States. The article notes that the Heritage Foundation used an illustration that included Jewish billionaires such as George Soros and Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois, deploying a classic antisemitic trope. Goldberg argues that this campaign conflates antisemitism with opposition to the Israeli state, leading to a twisted logic where ultra-Zionist gentiles lecture Jews about antisemitism. The article also criticizes the project's broad definition of its opponents, including not only radical groups but also mainstream liberals and Jewish individuals.</p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential deficit-increasing Republican fiscal plans, has amplified divisions within the Republican party. Fiscally conservative Republicans are using the downgrade as leverage to demand deeper cuts to federal programs, including Medicaid and food assistance, in a tax and spending cut package proposed by President Trump. These lawmakers, ideologically opposed to growing the federal debt, are pushing for further deficit reduction, while moderate Republicans worry that slashing social programs might jeopardize their congressional majority. The bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.</p>

This initiative is presented as a smoother alternative to forcible deportations, offering free travel and a $1,000 stipend.

These SPACs are often targeting cryptocurrency or blockchain companies, reflecting Trump's increased activity in the crypto market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled to allow the Trump administration to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, pending legal proceedings. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's revocation of the program. The TPS program provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries experiencing wars or natural disasters, allowing them to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, while lawyers for the TPS beneficiaries expressed shock, calling the decision the largest single action stripping immigration status in modern U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, accused of setting her husband on fire and driving a van over his burning body nearly 20 years ago, was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a second jury failed to acquit her. Stermer had previously been convicted in 2010, but a federal appeals court granted her a new trial in 2020. Prosecutors alleged that Stermer doused her husband with gasoline and set him on fire after he learned she was having an affair, while Stermer maintained it was an accident involving an oil lamp and candles.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to ignore their fears in response to Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to past downgrades that were followed by market declines. He argued that the downgrade prompted more fear than the short-term economic environment merited, suggesting that investors should view it as an early warning to invest more, not more aggressively. Cramer recommended gold and bitcoin as potential hedges against excessive government borrowing, but cautioned against selling based on the downgrade. He advised investors to remember that those spreading fear are either uninformed or shrewd short sellers.</p>
