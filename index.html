        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the prison sentence of former Republican Congressman George Santos, ordering his immediate release after less than three months of a seven-year term. Santos was convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, among other charges, and had pleaded guilty to several fraud crimes. Trump cited alleged mistreatment in solitary confinement and Santos's consistent Republican voting record as reasons for the commutation, calling him "somewhat of a 'rogue'." This controversial decision, influenced by a plea from Santos and advocacy from some Republican lawmakers, has drawn sharp criticism from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress, who argue that the brief incarceration does not deliver justice for his extensive deceit and financial wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Organizations across Los Angeles County are preparing to host dozens of "No Kings" rallies and marches on Saturday, building on previous large-scale demonstrations against the Trump administration's perceived authoritarianism. These events, supported by various national groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and MoveOn, aim to peacefully protest and assert democratic values. The article provides an extensive list of specific times and venues, along with notes for attendees, from Alhambra to Whittier. Organizers emphasize that communities are coming together to share a resolved message: "We don't do dictators or kings in America," highlighting diversity as strength and empathy as a superpower in their pushback against the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama, "Silent Honour," has inspired a significant public outpouring of praise and remembrance for real-life intelligence agents, particularly Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member. The article notes a "sudden surge" of visitors to Wu's tomb, where hundreds of flowers and thank-you notes were laid, occurring outside the traditional grave-sweeping festival. This phenomenon reflects the show's profound impact in highlighting "unsung heroes" and fostering national sentiment and appreciation for historical figures involved in intelligence work. The drama appears to have successfully connected with audiences, driving a renewed interest in and respect for those who served in covert capacities.</p>

          <h2>Billionaire Investor Bill Ackman Urges Curtis Sliwa to Exit NYC Mayoral Race</h2>

          <p>Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is actively intervening in the New York City mayoral race, publicly urging Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa to withdraw. Ackman contends that Sliwa's continued presence in the race significantly boosts the chances of socialist Democrat Zohran Mamdani, citing prediction market data. Ackman, who supports independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, believes a two-person contest would be more competitive. Sliwa's campaign, however, has rejected these calls, asserting that voters, not billionaires, should decide the outcome. This rare public foray by a high-profile investor into local politics highlights the contentious dynamics of the election, with Mamdani currently holding a substantial lead.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, signaling a reluctance to authorize Tomahawk missile transfers to Kyiv, citing concerns about escalation. This development follows Trump's recent success in brokering a fragile Gaza ceasefire and a surprise call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed trade deals and a Budapest summit without Ukrainian involvement. Zelenskyy, while praising Trump's Middle East efforts, avoided publicly pressing for the Tomahawks, instead offering a drone-sharing deal. Trump, aiming for a peacemaking legacy, appears to be prioritizing a negotiated end to the conflict through direct engagement with Putin, potentially delaying crucial military aid to Ukraine in the process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois, escalating a legal battle over the domestic use of the military in Democratic-led cities.

Democratic officials, including Illinois' governor, accuse Trump of politically motivated overreach and misrepresenting local conditions, asserting that protests have been mostly peaceful.

This article attributes the decline to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly in states like North Carolina, where overdose fatalities are down 35%. Initiatives include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, which redirect substance users from crime to recovery, and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment like methadone. The widespread availability of Naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, and a generational shift among young people avoiding opioids are also cited as crucial factors in this optimistic trend.</p>

          <p>Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended that Tesla investors vote against a proposed "mega performance equity award" for CEO Elon Musk, which could grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock. While acknowledging the plan's potential to create enormous shareholder value if ambitious targets are met, ISS cited "unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design." Tesla's board disagreed, urging shareholders to support the plan, arguing Musk receives nothing unless shareholders win big. This article highlights the ongoing debate over executive compensation, especially given a previous Delaware court ruling that rescinded Musk's 2018 pay package. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Pakistani national, Muhammad Pahlawan, has been sentenced to 40 years in a U.S. prison for smuggling ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen. Pahlawan was detained during a U.S. military operation in January 2024, an incident during which two U.S. Navy Seals drowned. His crew testified they were duped into believing they were fishermen. Prosecutors highlighted the sophistication of the weapons, including anti-ship cruise missile components and a warhead, noting they were part of a larger operation coordinated by Iranian brothers affiliated with the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. The article underscores the severity of the smuggling operation and its impact on international shipping.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has tentatively agreed to pay $828 million to settle over 400 additional sexual assault claims against county employees, following a historic $4 billion settlement approved six months prior. These settlements stem from a 2020 California law that suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual assault victims, enabling thousands of lawsuits alleging mistreatment in juvenile facilities dating back decades. The county faces unprecedented financial strain and is actively investigating allegations of fraudulent claims and attorney misconduct. Officials emphasize balancing victim compensation with taxpayer protection, while also implementing new safeguards, including a child sexual assault reporting hotline, to prevent future abuses.</p>

          <p>A viral classroom trend has kids and teens enthusiastically shouting "six, seven," often accompanied by a juggling motion, much to the bewilderment of adults. This article reveals the phrase originates from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," which he leaked without intending a specific meaning. The trend has since appeared in pop culture, including "Abbott Elementary" and "South Park." Teachers are finding it disruptive but also recognize its impossible-to-ban nature, as kids enjoy the generational "secret code." Experts suggest it's a playful way for youth to express themselves and perhaps a subtle call for adults to "lighten up."</p>

          <p>The US-China trade war is characterized by "blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and wild tariff swings," raising concerns that President Trump and President Xi Jinping's "shock tactics" may undermine chances of resolution. This article suggests that the disregard for diplomatic norms by both leaders is leading to misinterpretations and escalating tensions. Recent actions include Trump's salvoes following Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earth minerals, which in turn were triggered by Washington's expanded sanctions on blacklisted firms. Analysts believe this lack of clear communication and reciprocal aggressive moves creates an unpredictable and unstable environment for trade relations.</p>
