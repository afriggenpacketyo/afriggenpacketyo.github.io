            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has accused opponents of the UK's net zero carbon emissions target of spreading 'nonsense and lies.' Miliband emphasized the government's commitment to its environmental agenda, highlighting the potential for clean energy jobs and social justice. He argued that reliance on fossil fuels caused economic instability after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, impacting families through rising costs of living. Miliband criticized political opponents, including some Conservatives and Reform UK members, who claim the net zero agenda risks jobs and could bankrupt the country. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, lasting from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday. Putin stated that Russia would cease fighting and expected Ukraine to reciprocate, while also preparing for potential violations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded that Ukraine would mirror a full ceasefire and strike only in defense, proposing to extend it beyond Easter Day to reveal Russia's true intentions. The announcement follows previous failed ceasefire attempts and comes amid frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks. Optimism score: 30</p>
