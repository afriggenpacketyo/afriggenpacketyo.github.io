        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russell Vought, a former budget director for Donald Trump, has intensified his critique of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, vowing to investigate costly renovations at the Fed's headquarters. Vought labeled the building a "palace" and accused Powell of mismanagement and misleading Congress about the project's $2.5 billion cost. This move is seen as another front in Trump's campaign against Powell, whom he has criticized for not lowering interest rates. The accusations could potentially be used to build a case for dismissing Powell for cause, a move constrained by a recent Supreme Court ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," significantly reforms the federal student loan system. The legislation reduces the number of repayment plans from seven to two, consisting of a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven option called the Repayment Assistance Plan. It also introduces borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. While the White House promotes the changes as a simplification of a broken system, some critics express concern that borrowers may face longer repayment periods and reduced access to aid.

          <p>Russia has significantly increased its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine this week, escalating the conflict's intensity. This military surge coincides with President Trump's expressed frustration over Russian President Vladimir Putin's apparent reluctance to engage in peace negotiations. In response to the diplomatic stalemate and increased aggression, Trump has signaled that the United States would resume previously suspended weapons shipments to support Ukraine's defense efforts. The situation highlights the volatile interplay between battlefield dynamics and high-stakes international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Following their celebrated reunion, the band Oasis has seen a massive resurgence in popularity, capturing the top two spots on the UK album chart. Their greatest hits compilation, "Time Flies," returned to number one, while their classic 1995 album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" secured the second position. This chart dominance coincides with the start of their sold-out comeback tour, which began last week after a 16-year hiatus. The renewed fan enthusiasm demonstrates the enduring legacy of the Britpop icons, with several of their songs also re-entering the top 20 singles chart.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a grant backlog exceeding one billion dollars, prompting the agency to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to a new, bureaucratic review process, part of the "Defend the Spend initiative" (DOGE), established by the Trump administration. This has stalled funding for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and HIV care resources. The department is now in a race against the fiscal year-end deadline, which may require shortening application periods and potentially compromising the standard review process to disburse the funds.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with a significant sum like $10,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). Although short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, the extended compounding period of long-term CDs results in substantially greater interest earnings over time. For instance, a five-year CD could generate over $2,200 in interest, whereas a one-year CD would yield around $440 on the same principal. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and their need for liquidity versus maximizing long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tax professionals are highlighting a potential tax surprise in President Trump's new "big beautiful bill" for individuals with incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. The legislation temporarily raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 but includes a steep phaseout for higher earners within that specific income bracket. This phaseout mechanism can create what experts call a "SALT torpedo," an unusually high effective tax rate that could reach up to 45.5% on earnings within that range.

          <p>The Premier League is in discussions with the International Football Association Board (Ifab) about introducing "Ref Cams" to provide unique in-game footage for television broadcasts. These small cameras, mounted on a referee's ear, offer viewers a first-person perspective of the on-field action, speed, and player interactions. Following successful trials by Fifa at the Club World Cup, the Premier League is considering testing the technology in its US Summer Series. If approved by Ifab and the clubs, Ref Cams could be implemented next season, enhancing the viewing experience for fans and potentially aiding VAR decisions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece uses the case of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who identified as "Black/African American" on a college application, to critique race-based affirmative action. The author argues that the system encourages opportunistic racial accounting and is based on reductive, arbitrary categories that no longer serve their original purpose of redressing specific historical discrimination. The article contends that Mamdani, who comes from a privileged background, should not have received special consideration regardless of his self-identification. The author concludes by advocating for a shift from race-based preferences to a class-based system that aids the disadvantaged of all backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has soared to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, these funds recorded their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional confidence. The rally was also fueled by the liquidation of a significant number of short positions and macroeconomic factors, including expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve. This price surge marks a major milestone for the cryptocurrency, as corporate and institutional adoption continues to accelerate and drive the market to new records. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent California medical centers, including Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), are halting or reducing gender-affirming care services for transgender youth due to threats from the Trump administration. CHLA closed its pioneering transyouth center, citing the risk of losing essential federal funding, while Stanford Medicine has paused gender-affirming surgeries for minors. This has left thousands of young patients and their families scrambling for care in a state previously considered a sanctuary for trans rights.

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Trump administration's "Doge" initiative as a dangerous experiment in Silicon Valley governance that reflects a deep-seated, anti-institutional ideology. The author argues that the tech industry's goal of replacing public institutions with private digital platforms is fundamentally unsuited for managing public welfare. The piece traces this "techno-determinism" from early computing history to modern startup culture, warning that applying this logic to government leads to the degradation of democratic functions. The author calls for a "Digital New Deal" to rebuild and protect public institutions from this flawed, utopian vision.</p>

          <p>A court in Tunisia has sentenced 21 of President Kais Saied's most prominent political opponents to lengthy prison sentences, ranging from 12 to 35 years. The mass trial, criticized by human rights groups as politically motivated, targeted politicians and officials, including exiled former ministers and opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi. Ghannouchi, who is already jailed, received an additional 14-year sentence. Observers view the verdicts as the latest step in President Saied's consolidation of authoritarian power and an effort to eliminate any effective political opposition ahead of future elections.</p>

A recent survey indicates that while collective spending will be high, the average amount spent per child is expected to decrease slightly as parents exercise more caution due to economic concerns. The threat of new tariffs from the Trump administration is a major factor, with many shoppers starting early to preempt potential price hikes. In response to higher costs, a majority of parents report they are willing to switch to cheaper brands and cut back on non-essential purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing 210 disease outbreaks over 23 years has found that emergency vaccination programs were highly effective in saving lives. Researchers concluded that these rapid rollouts reduced deaths from five major diseases, including Ebola, cholera, and measles, by approximately 60 percent. The vaccinations also prevented a similar percentage of infections and generated an estimated $32 billion in economic benefits by averting deaths and disability. The study, backed by the vaccine alliance Gavi, underscores the critical importance of swift, well-funded vaccination campaigns as a counter-measure to the growing global risk of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Financial advisor Dave Ramsey recently reiterated his strong stance against credit card use, even for those who claim to pay their balance off monthly. In an interview, Ramsey called the idea of widespread consumer discipline a "great lie," pointing to data showing that the vast majority of users carry a balance. He argued that using plastic, credit or debit, encourages overspending by 12-18% compared to cash because it doesn't trigger the same psychological "pain" of payment. Ramsey advocates for using debit cards and cash to enforce budgeting and avoid the high-interest debt that he says traps millions of Americans. (not investment advice)</p>
