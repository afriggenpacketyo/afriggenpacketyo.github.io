        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial test vote on a comprehensive tax and spending bill supported by President Trump. Despite pressure from the White House to pass the legislation by July 4th, it remains uncertain if Senate Majority Leader John Thune has secured enough Republican votes to advance it. The bill, which includes tax cuts alongside significant reductions in Medicaid and food assistance funding, faces internal party disputes and procedural hurdles. Several Republican senators remain undecided or opposed, making the outcome of the vote highly unpredictable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of the major budget bill contains numerous provisions with wide-ranging impacts, including extensions of the 2017 tax cuts which primarily benefit upper-income families. A key update is the removal of a controversial "revenge tax" aimed at other countries, a relief for Wall Street investors. The bill also raises the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions and includes targeted carve-outs, such as increased deductions for whale-hunting expenses. However, it maintains contentious elements like deep cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach, Long Island. She suffered minor, non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. Although the woman did not see the creature, experts who examined photos of the injuries believe they were caused by a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols and drone surveillance will continue throughout the summer to ensure beachgoer safety, highlighting the rarity of such attacks.</p>

          <p>Following his selection as the top pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd has revealed unconventional plans for rookie Cooper Flagg. Kidd intends to test the 6-foot-9 forward's versatility by playing him at the point guard position during the upcoming NBA Summer League. The goal is to make Flagg uncomfortable and push his development by having him run the offense, a role he occasionally filled at Duke where he led the team in assists. Kidd emphasized that he is not concerned about potential mistakes, viewing them as a necessary part of growth for a young player.</p>

          <p>In an interview, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi confirmed that recent U.S. and Israeli actions have caused "very serious" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. While the full extent is still being assessed, Grossi stated the attacks represent a significant setback to Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. He stressed the urgent need for diplomatic reconnection and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify remaining materials and activities, as Iran's nuclear knowledge and industrial capacity cannot be eliminated by military means. The location of nearly 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium remains a key uncertainty.</p>

A concerned driver had called in what they believed to be a stranded cub. However, upon arrival, the responding officer discovered the animal in question was not a tiger but a deceased hawk. The incident highlighted a comical case of mistaken identity, and the California Department of Transportation was notified to handle the removal of the bird. Ownership of exotic animals like tigers is illegal for private citizens in California.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's success. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. Officials later shifted focus, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than complete destruction of nuclear capabilities. This evolving narrative has led to ongoing questions about the true extent of the damage and the ultimate strategic objectives of the military action.</p>

          <h2>Concerns Over Press Freedom in Kenya Rise After Deadly Anti-Government Protests</h2>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya, which resulted in 19 deaths and hundreds of injuries, have intensified concerns about press freedom and freedom of expression in the country. The government's security forces were reported to have used live ammunition on demonstrators, and the Communications Authority issued a temporary ban on live protest coverage. Critics, including the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, argue the government is using its authority to stifle dissent, particularly from the youth-led "Gen Z" movement. This movement protests economic hardship and what it sees as a tyrannical regime.</p>

          <p>At the Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress in Berlin, former Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a farewell speech reflecting on his time in government. He defended his administration's policies while also offering self-criticism. A significant portion of his address was dedicated to Russia, as he warned against having any illusions about Vladimir Putin's expansionist ambitions in Ukraine and defended the strengthening of the German military and NATO. The congress also saw the election of new party leadership after the SPD's poor performance in the recent parliamentary elections.</p>

Budapest's mayor supported the march by declaring it a municipal event, and numerous EU officials attended in solidarity.

          <p>Centrist Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska is set to announce his retirement from Congress, creating a prime pickup opportunity for Democrats in a key swing district. Bacon's departure from Nebraska's 2nd District, which represents the Omaha area, removes the advantage of incumbency for the GOP. In a closely divided House of Representatives where control could be decided by a handful of seats, this open race will become a top target for Democrats seeking to flip seats and win a majority in the upcoming election cycle. The formal announcement is expected soon.</p>

          <p>A civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the film "Rust" against the movie's producers, including Alec Baldwin, has been settled. The lawsuit alleged negligence and sought compensation for emotional distress following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The plaintiffs, who witnessed the incident, claimed that producers failed to adhere to industry safety protocols. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw the film's armorer convicted of involuntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>A 70-year-old man from Egypt has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he violently kicked a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old detector dog, named Freddie, alerted his handler to the man's suitcase. The man was found to be smuggling over 100 pounds of undeclared and prohibited agricultural products. Freddie suffered contusions from the kick, and the man was ordered to pay the veterinary bills before being removed back to Egypt.</p>

          <h2>Authors Urge Major Publishers to Limit Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 11:28:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of over 70 authors, including prominent names like Lauren Groff and Dennis Lehane, has published an open letter asking major publishing houses to commit to safeguards against artificial intelligence. The letter requests that publishers refrain from releasing AI-generated books, replacing employees with AI tools, or using AI for audiobook narration without human involvement. The authors express concern that AI poses an existential threat not just through copyright infringement but also by devaluing art and potentially allowing publishers to generate their own content to compete with human writers.</p>
