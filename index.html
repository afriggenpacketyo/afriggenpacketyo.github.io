          <p>Jihadist fighters, identified as members of Boko Haram, killed at least 60 people in a violent attack on the town of Darul Jama in Nigeria's Borno state. The assailants arrived on motorcycles, shooting indiscriminately and setting homes on fire, with many of the victims being residents who had only recently returned after years of displacement. This attack raises serious questions about the effectiveness of ongoing counterinsurgency operations and represents a major setback for efforts to resettle internally displaced people in the region.</p>

His call follows recent turmoil at the CDC, including the firing of its director and the replacement of an advisory committee with individuals holding anti-vaccine views.</p>

          <p>President Trump shared a social media post that appeared to threaten the deployment of troops to Chicago for a significant immigration and crime crackdown, similar to recent actions in Los Angeles. This has intensified a standoff with state and local leaders, who have vowed to sue the administration and have condemned the threat as authoritarian. The move follows the administration's request to station federal agents at a naval base near the city, signaling preparations for a large-scale operation.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors and legal experts argue that certain purchasing habits are preventing the upper middle class from becoming wealthier, despite high incomes. The primary drains on wealth are identified as new luxury vehicles, which depreciate rapidly, and expensive private school tuition, which can consume funds that could otherwise be invested. One attorney noted that a client's $6,000 monthly mortgage payment could have generated over $700,000 in returns if invested over a decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chicago area is bracing for a significant increase in U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, with officials expecting up to 300 agents to be active in the region. This expanded enforcement, part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on sanctuary cities, has prompted community concern and led to the postponement of the city's large Mexican Independence Day festival. Local leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, have pushed back against what they term "militarized immigration enforcement."</p>
