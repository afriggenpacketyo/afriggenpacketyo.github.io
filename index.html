          <p>On Earth Day, a group of climate activists known as Extinction Rebellion vandalized Wall Street's iconic Charging Bull statue by spraying it with neon green paint and writing "Greed=Death." The group protested against what they perceive as the financial industry's role in environmental destruction. The activists later cleaned the paint off the statue following their demonstration. 70</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorscuh and Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday sided with left-leaning justices on the court in an immigration appeals case, a narrow ruling that could portend the court's future thinking amid a flurry of legal cases centered on immigration. The Supreme Court ruled, with the backing of Robert and Gorsuch, that any voluntary departure deadlines for immigrants under the 60-day departure time frame that fall on a weekend or on a legal holiday in the U.S. should be extended to the next business day. The case is considered one of the most highly anticipated ones to be reviewed by the high court since Trump took office. 50</p>

This narrow ruling may indicate the court's future approach to upcoming high-profile immigration cases. 70</p>
