            <p>Bank of America reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by robust net interest income and trading revenue. The bank's profit rose by 11% to $7.4 billion, or 90 cents per share, with revenue increasing by 5.9% to $27.51 billion. This performance comes amidst concerns about President Trump's tariff policies potentially causing a recession, which have negatively impacted Bank of America's stock in recent weeks. The bank benefited from increased trading revenue due to market volatility, while consumer credit and wealth management remained stable.</p>

            <p>A top Chinese cyberspace official has cautioned that U.S. efforts to impede China's artificial intelligence (AI) advancements may ultimately harm the U.S. itself.

She criticized the U.S.'s tariff policies, suggesting they disrupt global value chains and slow down global innovation. This statement comes amid ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S. following the imposition of tariffs by President Trump.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent tariffs, while excluding Russia, have indirectly affected the Russian economy by causing a drop in oil prices. Fears of a global recession due to the U.S.-China trade war have led to decreased demand and lower prices for oil, impacting Russia, which relies heavily on oil and gas sales for government revenue. This development could potentially weaken Russia's ability to sustain its war efforts in Ukraine. It would be ironic if Trump's trade policies inadvertently weakened Russia's economy more effectively than the Biden administration's sanctions.</p>

            <p>A third federal judge has issued a temporary order halting certain deportations under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Judge Charlotte Sweeney's order prevents the Trump administration from removing noncitizens located in Colorado who are subject to Trump’s AEA Proclamation for two weeks. This decision follows similar rulings by judges in New York and Texas, creating a patchwork of district-level protections that limit the use of the AEA, as the Supreme Court lifted a nationwide order previously.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off as investors fled the safe haven amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, which forced him to suspend the duties. This led to a surge in Treasury yields, raising questions about who was selling and why. Speculation points to China, Japan's life insurers, hedge funds unwinding bond-basis trades, and 'bond vigilantes' reacting to inflationary policies. Some analysts suggest China selling Treasurys would harm its own investments, while others point to Japanese insurers reducing exposure due to policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Cody Balmer has been charged with attempted murder and arson after allegedly setting fire to the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside. Balmer admitted to harboring hatred toward Shapiro and using homemade Molotov cocktails to start the fire, and said he would have "beaten him with a hammer" if caught by Shapiro. Police investigations reveal Balmer's unstable background, including custody battles and a recent arrest for domestic assault. Balmer's mother stated her son is mentally ill and was not taking his medication.</p>

            <p>China has reportedly barred its airlines from accepting deliveries from Boeing in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariffs. The ban will apply to all existing orders from the US manufacturing giant, while Beijing has also told the country’s carriers not to buy any aircraft-related equipment or parts from other American companies. It comes after China imposed 125pc tariffs on US-manufactured goods, which more than doubled the cost of Boeing planes and made it impractical for airlines to buy them, according to Bloomberg.</p>

            <p>The UN human rights office has voiced concerns regarding the protection of civilians in Lebanon amidst ongoing Israeli military operations. Since a ceasefire in November, Israeli strikes have resulted in civilian casualties and infrastructure damage, with at least 71 civilians killed and 92,000 displaced. The U.N. is calling for investigations into all alleged violations of international law, emphasizing that every military action resulting in civilian deaths must be thoroughly examined. The UN also raised concern about recent Israeli military operations hitting civilian infrastructure, including a strike on April 3 which destroyed a newly established medical centre run by the Islamic Health Society in Naqoura.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Donald Trump's ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure in the U.S. may face significant delays due to proposed legislation in Texas that imposes regulatory hurdles on data centers. The legislation, aimed at protecting the state's power grid, could add up to 24 months to the approval process and increase construction costs. This could lead tech companies to scale back planned data center construction in Texas, potentially hindering Trump's AI initiative, even though Trump endorsed Texas lieutenant governor for re-election as recently as Thursday. The concerns are amplified by global slowdown in computing infrastructure development and increased construction costs related to Trump's tariff plan.</p>
