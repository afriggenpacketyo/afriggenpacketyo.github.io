        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Emory University professor, inspired by a trip to Denmark, undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies. She found that engaging in activities like tennis, mahjong, and home DIY helped her overcome doomscrolling, build community, and redefine self-care beyond passive consumption. The experience fundamentally changed her perspective on work-life balance, leading her to conclude that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to happiness and personal growth. This journey also helped her feel less lonely and improved her social interactions.</p>

          <p>The Mars Desert Research Station, operated by the nonprofit Mars Society, is located in the Utah desert and serves as a high-fidelity analog for Martian exploration. Crews of "analog astronauts" live in a confined habitat for weeks, following strict protocols and conducting research as if they were on Mars. This includes wearing simulated spacesuits for extravehicular activities (EVAs) in the Mars-like terrain. The facility aims to prepare humans for the psychological and logistical challenges of future missions to the red planet, which some experts believe could happen as early as 2029.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals that Florida was the most popular state for retirees in 2023, attracting a net gain of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older. Despite this leading position, the number represents a significant decrease from the previous year. The state's appeal is attributed to its lack of income, estate, or inheritance taxes, making it financially advantageous for those on fixed incomes. North Carolina and Arizona followed as popular retirement destinations, while California saw the largest exodus of this demographic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deaths from heart attacks have plummeted by nearly 90 percent in the U.S. since the 1970s, marking a significant public health achievement.

Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with challenges like obesity and diabetes posing ongoing risks.

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has voiced her lack of trust in the electronic line-calling system being used at Wimbledon for the first time, replacing human line judges. Following her loss to Aryna Sabalenka, Raducanu pointed to several "dodgy" calls she believed were incorrect, a sentiment echoed by other players like Jack Draper. The All England Club's chair defended the technology, citing player demand for it to reduce human error. Players have also complained that the automated "out" calls are too quiet to hear over the crowd noise.</p>

          <p>A group of eight OPEC+ nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, has agreed to increase their collective oil production by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This hike is larger than the previously anticipated 411,000 barrels and continues the process of unwinding voluntary supply cuts. The decision was attributed to a stable global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories. This move represents an acceleration in the restoration of supply that was previously curtailed to support prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article profiles the work of Reverend William Barber and the revived Poor People's Campaign, a moral movement challenging systemic poverty and injustice in the United States. Grounded in a tradition of nonviolent protest and "fusion" organizing that unites diverse groups, the movement stages actions like "Moral Mondays" to protest policies they deem harmful to the poor. Barber's approach frames political issues as moral crises, challenging what he calls "policy murder" and the wedding of nationalism with exploitation. The movement aims to build a moral counter-narrative and force a public reckoning with inequality.</p>

          <p>The credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit score calculations, a change that could impact millions of consumers. For users who make their payments on time, this could provide a new way to build a positive credit history, especially for younger people with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect scores. The change reflects the growing role of these popular point-of-sale loans in the consumer finance landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Guardian investigation has revealed the existence of the Old Glory Club (OGC), a network of far-right, men-only fraternal clubs with dozens of chapters across the United States. The group, which includes military personnel, civil servants, and prominent antisemitic influencers, promotes extremist ideologies and aims to build an offline social and political network. Researchers warn that this new breed of organization seeks to lower the barrier for entry into far-right activism by focusing on community building before political action. The OGC's activities and rhetoric raise significant concerns about the growth of organized racist groups.</p>

          <p>Michigan's iconic tart cherry industry, which produces 75% of the U.S. crop, is facing a severe crisis due to a combination of threats. Climate change is causing more volatile weather, including early thaws and late frosts that devastate harvests, with this year's crop estimated to be down by 70%. Additionally, farmers are struggling with rising land prices due to development, labor shortages, and the economic pressures of low prices and tariffs. These challenges endanger not just the cherry crop but the entire interdependent specialty crop and agrotourism economy of the region.</p>

          <p>The discovery of another body in Austin's Lady Bird Lake has intensified community fears of a potential serial killer, bringing the total number of bodies recovered from the lake since 2022 to 38. While police officials have repeatedly downplayed foul play, attributing most deaths to accidental drownings often involving alcohol, the high number of male victims has fueled public speculation. Some forensic experts argue that the pattern cannot be ignored and that the possibility of a murderer using the lake to dispose of victims should be seriously investigated by law enforcement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could have cancer-fighting properties. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may combat tumors by strengthening a key group of anti-tumor immune cells known as dendritic cells. These cells can become depleted as cancer progresses, and the study indicates that sildenafil could help reverse this process and restore their function. This discovery could potentially open up a new avenue for tumor immunotherapy strategies.</p>

          <p>A news analysis suggests that despite Israeli and U.S. declarations of a "historic victory" after recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, the threat is far from eliminated. While the attacks caused significant damage, experts believe Iran retains the knowledge, materials, and likely the will to reconstitute its program, potentially in more concealed locations. Iran has already moved to limit international inspectors' access, signaling its defiance. The situation sets the stage for a protracted, high-stakes conflict of cat-and-mouse, rather than a definitive end to Tehran's nuclear ambitions.</p>
