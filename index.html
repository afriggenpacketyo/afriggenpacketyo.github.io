            <p>A 14-year-old Palestinian-American, Amir Mohammed Rabee, was fatally shot in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prompting calls for President Trump to intervene. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that soldiers fired on three individuals throwing rocks, but Rabee's father disputes this account, claiming his son was throwing stones at an almond tree. The U.S. State Department offered condolences but refrained from further comment, citing respect for the family's privacy.

            <p>President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs are creating economic uncertainty as nations respond with varying strategies. Some countries are attempting to negotiate deals with the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while China has retaliated with its own tariffs, leading to threats of further escalation from the U.S. Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not back down by Tuesday. The tariffs are causing market volatility and raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, but only if they are given the right to challenge the government’s claim. The court said alleged Venezuelan gang members facing deportation to El Salvador may appeal, but only before a federal judge in Texas, where they are held. The court did not rule directly on the issue of the president's wartime power under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport “hostile” aliens.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to continue using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime powers law, to carry out rapid mass deportations of alleged gang members, but migrants subject to deportation must be given "an opportunity to challenge their removal". Trump has said that immigrants allegedly belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were "conducting irregular warfare" against the US and that he would deport them under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act. A lower court order had temporarily blocked the administration's summary deportations under the law meant to protect the US during wartime.</p>
