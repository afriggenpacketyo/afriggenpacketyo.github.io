          <h2>Democrats Should Prioritize Policy Over Messaging, Argues Vox Correspondent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eric Levitz from Vox argues that Democrats should focus more on policy and governance rather than getting caught up in messaging debates. He references a recent poll from Demand Progress which suggests voters prefer a candidate who fights corporate power over one who focuses on regulatory bottlenecks. Levitz contends that the political case for abundance policies rests on their material benefits, such as addressing housing shortages and infrastructure inefficiencies, and not merely on rhetorical appeal. He suggests that Democrats can pursue both abundance liberalism and populism simultaneously, as there is no inherent conflict between the two approaches. The article suggests that Democrats need to understand why blue states struggle with housing and infrastructure in order to effectively serve working people.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Nagasaki is weighing Taiwan's request to participate in the 80th anniversary ceremony commemorating the U.S. atomic bombing of the city. Taiwan has never been officially invited and does not have diplomatic missions in Japan or representative offices at the UN, which are typically prerequisites for invitation. This contrasts with Hiroshima, which indicated it would include Taiwan in its memorial event after Taipei expressed interest. The annual ceremonies in both cities mourn the victims of the atomic bombings and advocate for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>A fire at a drug rehabilitation center in Guanajuato, Mexico, resulted in the deaths of twelve people and injuries to at least three others. Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire, with reports suggesting the victims may have been locked inside the facility. This incident highlights the often unregulated and dangerous conditions of privately run rehab centers in Mexico, which have been targets of attacks in the past. Guanajuato is plagued by violence between the Jalisco New Generation cartel and the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel, with rehab facilities sometimes targeted due to suspected gang affiliations of patients.</p>

Adams used a fire extinguisher to spray her shoes, alluding to being on fire, which the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) deemed unsportsmanlike. Her disqualification also prevented her from competing in the 200-meter race, leading to protests and accusations of racial bias, as Adams is Black. The CIF upheld the decision, leaving Adams feeling "robbed" and "in shock."</p>

          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski, and he is likely to use his presidential veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The result is expected to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, which lost power eighteen months ago. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values and is a strong advocate for Polish sovereignty within the EU.</p>

          <p>As the US enters an expected active hurricane season, numerous National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices along the Gulf of Mexico coast are understaffed. Fifteen regional weather service offices, including those in Miami, Jacksonville, Puerto Rico, and Houston, lack the required number of meteorologists. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is also short five specialists, despite assurances of being fully staffed. Job cuts and a hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration have resulted in over 600 staff departures from the NWS since Trump took office, raising concerns about the ability to provide detailed, localized forecasts and respond effectively to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Katrina vanden Heuvel criticizes Donald Trump's proposed budget bill, arguing that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming the poor and significantly increasing the national deficit. The bill includes tax cuts for the top 1% of wage earners and cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and Snap, which would leave millions uninsured and without food assistance. She argues that this bill exemplifies the Republican governing philosophy of hypocrisy, favoring the wealthy at the expense of working-class Americans.

          <p>The author, a strategy instructor at war colleges, argues that historical memories and figures significantly influence countries' choices regarding war and peace. He uses examples from Britain, Estonia, Finland, and Poland to illustrate how past experiences shape their strategic cultures and policy decisions. The author notes that while past glories and horrors can inform strategic thinking, it is also necessary to lay some ghosts to rest to protect future generations. The author contends that this is a moderate sign of hope in a world haunted by reasonable forebodings.</p>

          <h2>Students Embrace AI Cheating, Prompting Rethinking of Humanities Education</h2>

          <p>A university teaching assistant reflects on the ubiquity of AI-generated writing among students and questions the ethics of enforcing rules against it. The author argues that the real value of a humanities education lies in the "formation of human persons" and the cultivation of practical wisdom (phronesis). She suggests that students' embrace of AI reveals a utilitarian view of education, which undermines the true purpose of the humanities. The author proposes adding friction back into the learning process by offering students a choice to use AI but requiring a reflection piece on its impact on their thinking.</p>

They contend that well-maintained plants and trees can help protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow the spread of fire. The authors emphasize that proper watering and maintenance are more important than species selection in preventing plants from becoming fuel for fires.
