          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage, with many phones being restricted to SOS mode for hours. The company acknowledged a software issue was responsible and confirmed their engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports on social media and outage-tracking sites like DownDetector indicated widespread disruptions, peaking with nearly 23,000 reports in one afternoon. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company faced in October 2024, raising concerns about network reliability for its users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed plans to rename the Department of Defense back to its original title, the Department of War, a name it held until after World War II. President Trump advocates for the change, arguing the military's focus should be on offense and warfighting capabilities rather than just defense. According to the administration, this rebranding is part of a broader effort to restore traditional military values and reflects a more assertive strategic posture. The name change would legally require an act of Congress, though the President has suggested he believes it could be done informally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation has shed light on the largely unregulated for-profit industry of "body brokers" in the United States, who acquire and sell dissected human remains for profit. Unlike in many other countries, loose US laws allow companies to charge significant fees for processing and distributing body parts to medical research centers and other clients. The article details harrowing stories of families who believed they were donating loved ones' bodies to science, only to discover they were dismembered and sold in a disrespectful manner. Critics call for stricter regulations similar to those governing organ donation to prevent the exploitation of grieving families.</p>

          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of the academic year and persistent absence later on. According to the figures, 57% of students who were partially absent during the initial week in September 2024 went on to miss at least 10% of the school year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the start of the term is a critical period for establishing attendance habits, urging schools and parents to prioritize getting children into classrooms. This focus comes as schools continue to grapple with higher absenteeism rates than those seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has decided not to run for reelection in 2026, a move that will open up a competitive race for her seat. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and has held several leadership positions within the Republican party. Her departure is expected to trigger a significant political contest in the state, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to announce her candidacy for the Republican nomination. Ernst's decision marks the end of a notable tenure that included advocacy for military sexual assault prevention and fiscal conservatism.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated there has been no communication from the White House and suggested the move has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The controversy arises amid President Trump's recent criticism of Chicago's crime rates and his administration's deployment of federal agents to other cities. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of crime in the city, escalating the political tensions.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer the world a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global dysfunction. As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can act as a bridge between competing interests. The piece argues that his philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a model for a new world order that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a necessary corrective to an international system often paralyzed by vetoes and competing national agendas.</p>

          <p>In response to reports of a potential federal deployment, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to prevent city police from cooperating with federal agents and demands that any federal personnel operate without masks and with clear identification. Johnson described the move as a preemptive measure to prevent civil rights violations, citing concerns over "unmarked vans" and harassment. This action escalates the conflict between Chicago's leadership and the Trump administration over federal intervention in the city, setting the stage for potential legal challenges.</p>

However, modern forensic analysis, including a new autopsy, revealed inconsistencies in Pusser's original account and evidence suggesting the crime scene was staged.

          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a formidable linebacker who was a cornerstone of the Dallas Cowboys' "Doomsday" defense, has died at 84. Jordan was a key player on the team that won the franchise's first Super Bowl in 1972, defeating the Miami Dolphins. A five-time Pro Bowler and a standout at the University of Alabama under coach Bear Bryant, he remained a beloved figure in the organization's history. After his retirement in 1976, he was the first player inducted into the team's Ring of Honor by owner Jerry Jones, and he still ranks second in the team's all-time tackles list.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his presidential authority. The court found that the power to impose such levies rests exclusively with Congress, invalidating the tariffs justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling affects duties on goods from over 60 countries but does not impact sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum or those from the first Trump administration. The administration has until October 14 to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing cautious guidelines on screen time for children, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development. The consensus recommends a "screen-free until age three" approach, as the first years are critical for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For older children, the concern is that screen time displaces crucial activities like social interaction, imaginative play, and motor skill development. While acknowledging the unrealistic nature of eliminating screens entirely, experts advise parents to supervise content, set clear rules, and prioritize real-world engagement to foster healthy growth.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could seriously threaten the central bank's independence. She argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term economic consequences such as higher inflation, weaker stock market performance, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, Patterson cautions that the eventual damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign, accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine stance and promotion of conspiracy theories. In an op-ed, Sanders condemned Kennedy's leadership, pointing to the recent firing of the CDC director and the administration's moves that could make it harder for Americans to access lifesaving vaccines. Sanders argued that Kennedy has launched a "war on science" that threatens to reverse decades of progress against preventable diseases, making his position as the nation's top health official untenable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to cut more than 500 jobs at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The announcement was made by acting CEO Kari Lake, who stated the move was directed by the President to reduce federal bureaucracy. This action comes despite a federal judge's recent order blocking Lake from firing VOA's director and questioning the administration's compliance with previous rulings to restore the broadcaster's operations. The move is seen by critics as a significant blow to the mission of the government-funded news organization.</p>

Other councils, including those controlled by Reform UK, state they will also press on with legal action, citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns.

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Wales, organized a rescue mission to move thousands of fish after a local waterway, Aberhafesp Brook, dried up due to prolonged drought conditions. A local man discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), rallied friends to help. The group successfully relocated numerous species, including salmon and trout, to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm, but the resident who initiated the rescue felt it was better than leaving them to die.</p>
