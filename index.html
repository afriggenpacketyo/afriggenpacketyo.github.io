          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has affirmed that August 1 is a "hard deadline" for new tariffs to be imposed on countries that have not negotiated new trade deals with the United States. Lutnick indicated that while smaller nations might face a baseline 10% tariff, larger economies will need to open their markets or face higher rates. The announcement is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships and reduce the U.S. trade deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was seen as a referendum on his leadership amid public frustration over rising prices and challenging trade negotiations with the United States. A loss of the majority would further weaken his government's ability to pass legislation, potentially leading to political instability and a challenge to his leadership from within his own party.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to halve the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, following public outrage over waterway pollution. This commitment follows new data showing serious pollution incidents hit a record high in 2024, increasing by 60%. The government plans a record £104 billion investment into the sector, which is expected to lead to higher consumer bills, while critics question if the pledge is strong enough.

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to take his family on a holiday to the Cotswolds in England next month. The choice of the affluent, picturesque region has drawn some attention, given Vance's "hillbilly" persona and his past criticisms of the UK and European governments. His trip will also include a visit to Scotland, where his previous comments about the government's abortion rights policies could lead to a less than welcoming reception.</p>
