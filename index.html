          <p>Target's shares experienced a significant drop following the announcement of Michael Fiddelke as the new CEO, despite the company surpassing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and sales forecasts. The retailer has faced challenges with declining store traffic and stagnant sales over the past four years, leading to a 60% tumble in shares from their 2021 peak. Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, outlined a strategy focused on restoring Target's reputation for unique items, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing business through technology. This leadership transition and strategic pivot aim to reverse recent performance inconsistencies and drive future growth.</p>

          <p>Hertz announced a strategic partnership with Amazon Autos to sell pre-owned vehicles online, a move designed to bolster its retail operations and profitability. Customers can now browse thousands of used Hertz vehicles on Amazon, complete purchases digitally, and pick up cars at Hertz locations, initially in four major cities with plans for nationwide expansion. This collaboration provides Hertz with increased visibility for its car sales business and expands Amazon's nascent auto sales platform, which previously only offered new vehicles. The initiative is part of Hertz's "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" turnaround plan, focusing on fleet management, revenue optimization, and cost efficiency, following its 2020 bankruptcy and a failed EV strategy.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military is calling up approximately 60,000 reservists in preparation for a major ground offensive to capture Gaza City, with operations already underway in areas like Zeitoun and Jabalia. This significant mobilization has drawn strong condemnation from international allies and humanitarian organizations, who warn of a horrific humanitarian impact and further mass displacement of Palestinians. Despite Hamas accepting a new 60-day truce proposal, Israeli officials insist on a comprehensive deal for all hostages, with only 20 believed to be alive. The offensive, dubbed "Operation Gideon's Chariots," aims to eliminate Hamas and secure the release of remaining hostages, with civilians urged to move south for safety.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in France are investigating the death of Raphael Graven, known online as "Jean Pormanove," who died during a livestream where he was reportedly mistreated by two others. Graven had built a following by participating in live internet shows featuring abuse and humiliation on platforms like Kick, which is perceived as having less stringent user terms than rivals. French government minister Clara Chappaz condemned the incident as "absolute horror," emphasizing the responsibility of online platforms for disseminating illicit content. This tragic event has prompted a wider investigation into alleged deliberate violent acts against vulnerable people broadcast online, raising serious concerns about content moderation and the safety of participants in such streams.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 07:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights the health risks associated with grilling cured meats like hot dogs and bacon, which often contain high levels of nitrite (sodium nitrite, E 250). While nitrite acts as a preservative and enhances flavor, it can convert into toxic nitrite in the body and form carcinogenic nitrosamines when heated, especially during grilling. The European Food Safety Authority has classified ten nitrosamines as carcinogenic, and their intake in the EU is considered a public health risk. Although new EU regulations from October 2025 will reduce permitted nitrite levels, experts advocate for a complete ban, citing safer, natural alternatives already used in some European countries.</p>

          <p>Two years after the devastating Maui wildfires, many Filipino survivors in Lahaina feel marginalized in recovery efforts, citing long-standing socio-economic disparities and language barriers. Filipino immigrants, who comprised about 40% of Lahaina's population and were crucial to its tourism industry, face difficulties accessing aid, with federal funds primarily earmarked for rebuilding owner-occupied homes, leaving little for direct rental assistance. Issues include delayed temporary housing, lack of translated resources in Ilokano or Tagalog, and the traumatic disruption of multi-generational households. Advocacy groups highlight increased PTSD symptoms, financial anxiety, and domestic violence among survivors, urging for extended FEMA assistance and inclusive recovery programs to address these systemic failures.</p>

          <p>Weekly mortgage application volume, including both refinance and homebuyer demand, stalled last week despite only a minuscule increase in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly to 6.68%, with points decreasing. Refinance applications fell 3% for the week, but were 23% higher than the same week one year ago, indicating volatility given the current higher rates compared to last year. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose a marginal 0.1% for the week, also up 23% year-over-year, reaching their strongest pace in four weeks. This suggests prospective homebuyers remain active despite economic headwinds and affordability challenges.</p>

          <p>The authors of "And Tango Makes Three," a children's book about gay penguins, discuss the alarming rise in book bans across the U.S., including their own work, and a new legal strategy threatening free speech. A 2023 court ruling in Texas, allowing book removal by classifying library collections as "government speech," could overturn decades of precedent protecting the right to read. This doctrine, if upheld by the Supreme Court, could enable widespread censorship of any book deemed objectionable by authorities. The authors, parents themselves, advocate for the right to access diverse perspectives in libraries, drawing parallels to a successful protest against a book ban in Singapore.</p>

          <p>As climate change shortens winters, ticks are migrating to new areas, potentially introducing new diseases, but limited surveillance efforts are leaving doctors unprepared for emerging threats. Biologists in Montana, for example, found deer ticks, known carriers of Lyme disease, for the first time, highlighting the spread. Many state and local health departments lack comprehensive tick surveillance programs due to funding issues, relying instead on less effective passive reporting. This lack of data hinders medical providers' ability to diagnose and treat tick-borne illnesses effectively, as knowing local tick species is crucial for patient care.

The Home Office acknowledges the ruling creates practical difficulties for housing 32,000 asylum seekers across 210 hotels and fears it could incite further violent protests.

          <p>UK inflation, measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 3.8% in the year to July, marking its highest level since January 2024 and remaining above the Bank of England's 2% target. This increase was primarily driven by a significant jump in air fares, likely due to the timing of school holidays, and rising food and non-alcoholic beverage prices. Beef, chocolate, and instant coffee saw notable price hikes, stretching household finances. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% but noted future cuts would be gradual and careful, balancing inflation concerns with a struggling economy and uncertain job market.</p>

          <p>This article proposes converting downtown Los Angeles' vacant office skyscrapers into affordable co-living spaces to address the city's housing shortage and commercial emptiness. While traditional apartment conversions are financially challenging without substantial public subsidy, co-living models, featuring small private units with shared kitchens and bathrooms, offer a more cost-effective solution, producing three times more units at a third of the cost per square foot. These units, potentially priced at $1,000 per month, could provide valuable, affordable housing for various vulnerable populations. The proposal suggests a collaborative effort between public and private sectors to make these projects less risky and foster civic revitalization.</p>

          <h2>Hollywood Comedies Seek Theatrical Comeback Amidst Shifting Industry Trends</h2>

          <p>Hollywood's big-screen comedies are attempting a comeback after years of decline, with recent releases like "The Naked Gun" and "Freakier Friday" showing modest box office success and critical approval. The genre's decline is attributed to rising production costs, evolving humor, and limited international appeal, leading many comedies to migrate to streaming platforms. Filmmakers emphasize the unique value of communal laughter in theaters, similar to horror films, questioning why only "fight-or-flight" experiences are prioritized for shared viewing. Industry insiders suggest that for theatrical comedies to thrive again, studios need to commit to making them on modest budgets and recognize the existing hunger for comedic content, often found in TV series and streaming specials.</p>

          <p>Zoey Deutch stars as Jean Seberg in Richard Linklater's "Nouvelle Vague," a film exploring the making of Jean-Luc Godard's iconic 1960 feature debut, "Breathless." Deutch underwent a significant transformation, including Seberg's famous pixie haircut, and learned French to embody the role, which she describes as playing three parts: Seberg, her character Patricia, and the blend of both. The article highlights Seberg's tumultuous career, from her difficult early films to her later struggles and FBI surveillance, but notes Linklater's focus on her formative "Breathless" period. The film delves into the teasing dynamic between Seberg and Godard, celebrating the creative drive and authenticity behind cinematic artistry.</p>

          <p>Southern California is preparing for a "trio of impactful hazards" this week, including extreme heat, heightened fire risk, and potential monsoonal thunderstorms, urging residents to prepare. Temperatures are expected to reach near-record highs of 95-110 degrees, with little overnight relief, posing significant health risks and potential fatalities, especially for vulnerable populations. The prolonged heat, combined with low humidity, creates conditions for extreme and rapid wildfire growth, prompting red flag warnings across mountains and foothills. Additionally, thunderstorms from Friday to Sunday could bring gusty winds, minor flooding, debris flows in burn scars, and lightning, further exacerbating fire dangers. Officials urge residents to prepare for these combined threats, with cooling centers available across Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>A National Park Service employee, Shannon Joslin, was terminated and may face criminal charges for unfurling a trans-pride flag over El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, sparking outcry from LGBTQ+ activists. Joslin, a wildlife conservationist, was off-duty and used no park materials for the May 20 demonstration, which aimed to affirm transgender identity. Park officials cited a new rule prohibiting flags on natural features, which Joslin claims did not exist at the time of the incident and was retroactively dated. This firing has sparked outrage, with activists demanding Joslin's reinstatement and an independent investigation, viewing it as part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on political demonstrations and LGBTQ+ visibility, challenging free speech rights for civil servants.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the intense hype surrounding artificial intelligence is rapidly diminishing, particularly after OpenAI's highly anticipated GPT-5 proved to be a disappointment, being less user-friendly and capable than its predecessors. This underperformance challenges the industry's core belief that "scaling up" with more computing power and data would inevitably lead to artificial general intelligence. The article suggests that the AI sector, which has attracted hundreds of billions in investment without turning a profit, may be a "bubble-shaped" market, akin to the dot-com era, risking a painful reckoning for investors. Predictions of large-scale job losses and significant productivity gains from AI are also being re-evaluated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-run Legislature are pushing a mid-year redistricting plan, to be put to voters in November, aimed at countering Republican efforts in Texas to redraw congressional district lines. Critics argue this partisan gerrymander undermines California's independent redistricting commission, which was established to remove line-drawing from self-interested politicians. While Democrats see it as a necessary pushback against Trump's actions, some view it as a shortsighted and expedient move that distracts from the party's broader messaging challenges.

Struggling with a severe cocaine habit and paranoia, Gaye had moved back into his parents' home, where a volatile, lifelong conflict with his disapproving father escalated. The elder Marvin Gay Sr., who had a history of abuse towards his son, shot him twice after an altercation. Prosecutors faced a weak case due to evidence of Gaye's drug use, his father's brain tumor, and physical bruises on the father suggesting a severe beating. Marvin Gay Sr. eventually pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and received probation, with some family members believing Gaye orchestrated his own death.</p>

Family and activists demand the immediate release of unedited body camera footage and question the officers' de-escalation tactics, highlighting concerns about police conduct. The incident has fueled community distrust in Boyle Heights, where police shootings are frequent, and comes as LAPD shootings have increased in 2025.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office vehemently opposes their release, citing "shifting stories" and a lack of full insight into their crimes.

Although California's indoor heat rule, effective July 2024, mandates access to water, cooling areas, and monitoring at specific temperatures, enforcement is lacking, potentially due to staffing shortages at Cal/OSHA.

This discovery could lead to more efficient synthesized speech for users but raises significant privacy concerns about mental transparency. Scientists found that imagined speech produces signals similar to attempted speech, which AI can translate with high accuracy. While safeguards like "wake phrases" were tested, experts warn that the boundary between public and private thought may be blurrier than assumed, posing potential risks, especially with future consumer-grade BCIs and the lack of robust regulations.</p>
