          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has been engaging with world leaders and preparing a case for potential military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement. Diplomatic efforts appear focused on justifying a response rather than de-escalation. Security forces from both sides have exchanged intermittent fire across the border, and a clampdown is underway in Kashmir with numerous arrests made in the search for the attack's perpetrators. The situation remains volatile as India weighs its options for retaliation against perceived terror safe havens. </p>

          <p>China is aggressively integrating artificial intelligence into its agricultural sector as part of a comprehensive 10-year plan aimed at boosting food production and addressing food security concerns. Facing climate pressures, geopolitical tensions, and declining self-sufficiency rates, China sees AI as a solution to improve efficiency, reduce post-harvest losses, and strengthen its agricultural technology exports. The plan builds upon existing frameworks and prioritizes technological advancements to feed its large population with limited arable land and freshwater resources. This initiative underscores China's commitment to modernizing its agricultural practices to ensure a stable food supply.</p>

          <p>A former Disney World employee, Michael Scheuer, was sentenced to three years in prison for hacking into the park's menu system after being fired. Scheuer, who had worked as a menu production manager, altered allergy information, added profanities, and changed pricing, though none of the changes made it to the public.

          <p>The United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are discussing a "minerals-for-security" deal that could potentially challenge China's dominance in the mining industry.

This arrangement aims to reduce the DRC's reliance on China and broker peace in the country's east, where violence has escalated.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly deported three American children, along with their undocumented mothers, from Louisiana. The deportations have drawn criticism from civil rights groups, who claim the actions were illegal and inhumane. One of the deported children reportedly has a serious medical condition and was deported without medication or medical consultation. A federal judge has raised concerns about the legality of deporting a US citizen, scheduling a hearing to address the matter.</p>
