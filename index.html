          <p>G.O.P. lawmakers in swing districts are facing tough decisions regarding budget cuts to popular programs to fund President Trump's agenda. Representative Gabe Evans of Colorado, whose district includes many Medicaid recipients, is helping to write legislation that could significantly reduce Medicaid spending. The Republican budget resolution instructs the Energy and Commerce Committee, where Evans sits, to slash spending by $880 billion over the next decade, making substantial Medicaid cuts unavoidable. These lawmakers are caught between supporting their party's agenda and potentially alienating constituents who rely on these programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump stated that lower interest rates would act as "jet fuel" for the markets and accused Powell of being a "fool" who doesn't have a clue. Powell has maintained that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for maximum employment and price stability, dismissing any influence from political pressure. Trump's comments have previously caused market unease, with investors fearing potential threats to the Fed's independence.</p>

          <p>Maryland has begun restricting the use of fertilizer made from sewage sludge due to contamination with harmful "forever chemicals." As a result, Synagro, a major sludge-fertilizer maker controlled by a Goldman Sachs investment fund, seeks permits to use more sludge in Virginia, raising concerns among environmentalists and fishing groups. They fear this could poison farmland and waterways feeding the Potomac River, effectively making Virginia a dumping ground for Maryland's contaminated sludge. Research indicates that these chemicals, known as PFAS, can contaminate farms and surrounding water sources, posing risks to drinking water and wildlife.</p>

Senate Majority Leader John Thune stressed the bill's importance in providing clarity for innovators and bringing digital assets into the U.S. financial system, but Democrats sought more time to review the legislation.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled the framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs. The deal retains a 10% U.S. tariff on U.K. imports but adjusts tariffs on U.K. autos, creating a $5 billion export opportunity for U.S. farmers and producers. The agreement also commits both countries to enhancing industrial and agricultural market access and streamlining customs procedures for U.S. exports. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal, some experts downplayed its impact, noting that the U.S. has a trade surplus with the U.K., limiting its broader applicability.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, a policy his administration previously attempted to implement. This plan ties the prices of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggested the policy's return, citing high prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic, while also defending the decision not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid due to their prohibitive costs.</p>

          <p>Economists have adjusted their forecasts for interest rate cuts as President Trump's tariffs raise the risk of higher inflation and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the need to wait and assess the impact of Trump's policies before taking action on interest rates. Economists now anticipate a potential rate cut in September or later, with some suggesting a more aggressive half-point cut may be necessary to shore up the economy. The Fed's cautious approach reflects uncertainty about trade policy and its potential effects on inflation, requiring concrete evidence of economic weakness before lowering rates.</p>

          <p>The Milken Institute Global Conference, a gathering of finance and corporate leaders, revealed a mix of anxiety and optimism regarding financial markets and the economy. Concerns about volatile markets, trade tensions, and federal government cuts were prevalent, but there was also a growing sense of optimism regarding technology and cost-cutting. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, aimed to ease concerns, emphasizing pro-growth policies and potential trade deals. However, skepticism remained, with some fund managers acknowledging uncertainty and considering investments in Europe due to the uncertain future of the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will replace Ed Martin, his controversial pick for U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, due to a lack of Senate support. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" activist, had been appointed on an interim basis and oversaw the demotion of prosecutors involved in Jan. 6 cases. Senator Thom Tillis opposed Martin's nomination due to concerns about the Capitol riot. Trump hopes to find another position for Martin at the Justice Department and will announce a new nominee soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. While the deal is in the process of being finalized, it is expected to include increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates.</p>
