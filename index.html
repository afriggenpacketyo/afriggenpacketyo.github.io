          <p>An Arkansas couple was killed in a suspected homicide while hiking with their two young daughters, aged 7 and 9, in Devil's Den State Park. Clinton and Cristen Brink were found deceased, though their children were unharmed and are now with family. Authorities have released a description of a male suspect seen leaving the park in a black sedan and are asking the public for any photos or videos from the area. The investigation is ongoing, with state police leading the effort and the FBI offering assistance in this tragic and unsettling case.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant surge after the European Union agreed to a landmark $750 billion energy purchase from the United States. This deal is part of a broader trade agreement aimed at reducing the EU's energy dependence on Russia. Companies like Cheniere and Venture Global saw their stock prices climb, reflecting market optimism about increased demand. The agreement also includes a 15% U.S. tariff on EU exports and a commitment from Brussels to invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to implement a global baseline tariff of 15% to 20% on imports from countries without a specific trade agreement with the U.S. This represents a significant increase from the previously suggested 10% rate, potentially impacting smaller nations more heavily. The statement comes as an August 1 deadline for negotiating individual deals approaches, with administration officials indicating they are not pressured to make numerous separate agreements. This new tariff range aligns with recent deals struck with major partners like Japan and the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a condition contributing to 5-10% of general aviation accidents, which are 90% fatal. The system involves a flight suit or pilot seat that uses haptic vibrations, similar to a car's lane departure warning, to provide sensory cues to a disoriented pilot. This additional sensory input is designed to help pilots maintain control when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in bad weather. The goal is to conduct flight tests to validate the technology and ultimately enhance flight safety.</p>

          <p>NHS England has condemned the British Medical Association's (BMA) "increasingly hardline" stance on rejecting requests for striking resident doctors to return to work for emergencies. During the latest five-day walkout over pay, a BMA panel denied 18 of 27 'derogation' requests, which are made when patient safety is at risk. The NHS expressed particular concern over rejections related to cancer care, accusing the union of prioritizing the strike over urgent patient needs. The BMA defended its position, stating hospitals were using the system to cover for poor planning rather than for genuine critical emergencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just "10 or 12 days." Expressing disappointment over a lack of progress, Trump threatened new sanctions on Russia and its trade partners if a peace deal is not reached swiftly. The move marks a tougher public stance, as Trump voiced frustration with Putin's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities despite previous discussions.

This article calculates potential earnings, showing that short-term CDs with fixed rates currently offer slightly higher returns than high-yield savings accounts with variable rates. For example, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn about $15 more than a savings account at 4.30%. The primary advantage of a CD is its guaranteed interest rate, providing predictability in an uncertain market. (not investment advice)</p>

This national policy follows various provincial-level incentives aimed at reversing three consecutive years of population decline and a record-low marriage rate. High childcare costs and career pressures have deterred many young couples from having children.

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to cease U.S. funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, they expressed "grave concerns" over the private, Israeli-backed organization's operations, which have been linked to numerous civilian deaths at aid distribution sites. The senators are calling for the U.S. to resume support for established U.N.-led aid mechanisms instead. This move comes amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with the U.N. warning of widespread starvation and criticizing GHF's methods as unsafe.</p>

          <p>Under international pressure, Israel has begun allowing more humanitarian aid into Gaza and has announced daily pauses in fighting to facilitate distribution. Convoys of aid trucks are now moving, and humanitarian airdrops have been conducted by Israel, Jordan, and the UAE. However, the United Nations and other aid agencies state that the current volume is a fraction of what is needed to prevent a deepening starvation crisis for the territory's two million people. The U.N. warns that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and that at least 500-600 trucks are needed daily.</p>

          <p>In Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 38 of the 56 people they abducted from Banga village in March, even after ransoms were paid. A local official reported that the criminal gang, known as bandits, had demanded a ransom for each captive. After receiving payment, they released 18 women and one boy but slaughtered the remaining hostages, most of whom were young people. This brutal act highlights the escalating violence of the region's kidnapping-for-ransom industry, which persists despite a 2022 law criminalizing ransom payments, as families often feel they have no other choice.</p>

          <p>The Sahel region has transformed into a major hotspot for smuggling people, drugs, and other illicit goods, fueled by political instability and shifting alliances. Following military coups in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso, new governments have moved closer to Russia and away from European partners, repealing anti-smuggling laws and creating a boom for criminal networks. The United Nations reports an explosive increase in drug seizures, particularly cocaine, as the region becomes a key transit route from Latin America to Europe. This lucrative trade is corrupting local officials and changing the dynamics between smugglers and jihadist groups.</p>

Curators described the discovery as exceptionally rare and exciting, as it provides a direct, personal connection to an individual from the ancient world.

Sophie-Leigh Gemmell admitted to culpable and reckless conduct for the incident, which occurred in the dark and during bad weather. The video, which was seen on social media, showed the child peering over the steering wheel while the mother cheered.

The research team developed a risk-assessment framework to map global hotspots for these superbug-related genes.
