          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 15:51:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's government has officially banned the hard-line Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after violent clashes with police resulted in at least five deaths. The ban cites the group's "violent and terrorist activities" and follows a history of confrontations, particularly over the country's strict blasphemy laws. The TLP, known for its large grassroots support and aggressive stance, was previously banned in 2021, but the restriction was later lifted. This move is seen by analysts as a response to both internal security concerns and Pakistan's recent realignment with the United States.</p>

          <p>Since early September, the U.S. military has conducted at least 10 strikes against vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific suspected of smuggling narcotics, resulting in over 40 fatalities. The Trump administration asserts its authority to conduct these operations without congressional approval, designating several cartels as terrorist organizations and framing the drug trade as an "armed attack" on the U.S. The actions have drawn criticism from lawmakers and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who claims innocent individuals have been killed, raising legal and diplomatic questions about the escalating campaign.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the U.S. is actively seeking the quick deployment of an international peacekeeping force to stabilize the Gaza Strip. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the composition of the force must be acceptable to Israel, which has reportedly rejected Turkish involvement. The peace plan also calls for a temporary committee of independent technocrats to manage Gaza's civil affairs, though Hamas's role and disarmament remain unresolved issues. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with the U.S. also confirming that the UN agency UNRWA will not be active in post-conflict Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice will send federal observers to monitor polling sites in five California counties and one New Jersey county for upcoming elections. The decision follows requests from the Republican parties in both states, who cited concerns about potential "irregularities" and voter confidence. The move has been criticized by Democratic officials as an inappropriate "intimidation tactic" aimed at suppressing votes in key off-year elections. This action is part of a broader focus on election integrity under the Trump administration, which has raised fears of partisan interference in the electoral process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, his son, and his interior minister, accusing them of enabling drug cartels. The Treasury Department stated the sanctions were a response to a surge in cocaine production in Colombia, which it claims Petro has failed to stop. This action marks a significant escalation in tensions between the two leaders, fueled by Petro's criticism of recent U.S. military strikes on suspected drug boats. In a related move, the Pentagon is also deploying an aircraft carrier to the waters off South America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis of a brain aneurysm, seemingly linking it to stress, medical experts have clarified the connection. Doctors state that while stress itself does not directly cause an aneurysm, it can elevate blood pressure, a key factor in their formation and potential rupture. The primary risk factors are identified as genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but managing blood pressure and avoiding smoking are crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is poised to decide on whether the president can deploy military troops within American cities against the will of state and local officials. The case stems from an emergency appeal by the Trump administration to overturn a lower court's block on sending the National Guard to Chicago for immigration enforcement. The administration argues the president has "exclusive discretion" in such matters, a claim that alarms legal experts and Democratic officials who fear it could transform the military into a personal police force. The ruling will have significant implications for executive power and federal-state relations.</p>

The decision came after President Trump abruptly terminated negotiations, calling the ad "FAKE" and "egregious" for its use of a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Ford stated the ad, which ran during the World Series, had achieved its goal of starting a conversation about the economic impact of tariffs. The U.S. has imposed significant levies on Canadian goods, heavily impacting Ontario's manufacturing sector.</p>

He and an accomplice are the first to be convicted under the UK's new National Security Act.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% forecast by economists. The data suggests that the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices has been somewhat muted, as businesses absorb some of the costs. This inflation reading is crucial as it is used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. Despite the increase, the benign report is seen as unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from implementing another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dahbia Benkired, 27, has been given a whole-life sentence, France's most severe penalty, for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in 2022. The sentence, which is extremely rare and makes Benkired the first woman to receive it, requires her to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. The horrific crime shocked the nation and was seized upon by far-right politicians because Benkired, an Algerian immigrant, was under an order to leave France at the time of the attack. The court cited the "extreme cruelty" and "true torture" inflicted upon the victim.</p>
