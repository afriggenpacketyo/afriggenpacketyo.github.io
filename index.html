          <p>British number one Emma Raducanu continued her strong North American form, securing a routine 6-2, 6-4 victory against Elena-Gabriela Ruse at the Canadian Open. This win propels her into the second round, where she will face Peyton Stearns, building on her recent semi-final appearance at the Washington Open. Raducanu expressed satisfaction with her performance, highlighting her ability to maintain focus despite playing a friend, and her success in finding rhythm on hard courts. This momentum is crucial as she prepares for the US Open, the final Grand Slam of the year and a tournament she won in 2021, showcasing her current excellent form.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 18:23:29 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration has accepted an “unconditional donation” of a luxury jet from Qatar, with its retrofitting cost remaining classified despite lawmakers speculating it could reach $1 billion. The agreement, signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, allows the Air Force to prepare the plane for presidential use, though earlier plans suggested it would transfer to the Trump presidential library foundation post-presidency. Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, question the use of taxpayer dollars for an aircraft potentially intended for private use after a short official tenure. Funding for the refurbishment is reportedly diverted from the Sentinel nuclear missile program, raising further concerns.</p>

          <p>The women-only dating advice app Tea announced that a previously disclosed cyberattack was more extensive than initially believed, compromising users' direct messages and an additional 59,000 images. In response, the company has taken the affected system offline to mitigate further risks. This incident underscores critical cybersecurity concerns, with experts like Ted Miracco of Approov criticizing Tea's inadequate security measures, arguing they "rushed to market" without sufficient protection. Miracco emphasized that consumers often mistakenly assume apps available on major platforms are inherently safe, highlighting the company's failure to provide promised security.</p>

In his campaign launch, Cooper framed the election as a crucial fight to protect the middle class, criticizing D.C. politicians for increasing national debt and cutting programs to fund tax breaks for billionaires.

          <p>Economists are analyzing the new U.S.-EU trade agreement, with many suggesting it is "asymmetric and unbalanced" and will negatively impact the EU's economic growth. The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods enter the EU tariff-free, and the EU also committed to massive U.S. energy purchases and investments. While the Trump administration touts benefits for U.S. exports and manufacturing, analysts like Capital Economics forecast a 0.2% reduction in the EU's annual GDP. Despite the sharp increase in U.S. tariffs, the agreement is seen by some as preferable to a full-blown trade war, offering some certainty to trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presented a European-led peace plan for Gaza to U.S. President Donald Trump during their meeting in Scotland, following discussions with French and German leaders. This initiative comes amidst renewed international pressure for a ceasefire and calls for immediate recognition of Palestinian statehood. The plan aims to provide immediate relief in Gaza and establish a pathway to a two-state solution. While Trump emphasized immediate aid delivery, Starmer's spokesman reiterated the UK's stance that Palestinian statehood is a question of "when, not if," reflecting growing support among MPs for recognition.</p>
