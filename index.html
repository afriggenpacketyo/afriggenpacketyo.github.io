          <p>The Israeli government has approved a plan to capture the entire Gaza Strip and maintain control indefinitely, prompting international concern, particularly from the European Union, regarding the humanitarian crisis that would be exacerbated by such an expansion. The plan includes relocating Palestinians to southern Gaza and preventing Hamas from distributing aid, with Israel accusing Hamas of using aid to strengthen its rule. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the population would be moved for their own protection, though details remain vague, and the U.N. has criticized the plan, citing it violates core principles. The families of Israeli hostages have expressed alarm, fearing the plan endangers the hostages, while Israel insists there is sufficient food in Gaza, blaming Hamas for distribution failures.</p>

The event takes place amidst increased scrutiny of race and diversity initiatives, particularly in cultural institutions, with some seeing the Met as a symbol of resistance against anti-D.E.I. policies. The gala is expected to feature more Black designers, stylists, and celebrities than ever before, marking a significant moment for Black representation in fashion. Anna Wintour emphasizes the show's focus on self-determination and creativity, while acknowledging its heightened meaning in the current political climate, as the show focuses on the history of Black Dandyism.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is resuming collections on defaulted federal student loans, ending a nearly five-year pause that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent analysis reveals that delinquency rates among student loan borrowers are at an all-time high, with over 20% at risk of defaulting. Borrowers in default could face wage garnishment, withheld Social Security benefits, and a damaged credit score. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that American taxpayers will no longer serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies, despite previous attempts by the Biden administration to provide debt relief. The article underscores the challenges faced by borrowers struggling to resume payments after the pandemic-era pause.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop following Warren Buffett's surprising announcement to step down as CEO, ending his 60-year tenure, with Greg Abel slated to take over on January 1, 2026. Class A shares fell nearly 5%, and Class B shares also declined after reaching record highs. Despite the drop, shareholders expressed confidence in the transition, noting Buffett's continued role as chairman, which means he can continue to mentor Greg and the Berkshire leaders, while also providing additional intellectual capacity when the inevitable time for more major capital allocation occurs. Buffett's departure marks the end of an era for Berkshire, which has grown into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate under his leadership.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to provide tariff exclusions for small businesses importing goods, warning that tariffs could severely harm Main Street and increase recession risks. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber's president, Suzanne Clark, emphasized that small businesses lack the financial cushion to absorb increased tariff rates. The Trump administration's tariff policies are already impacting growth, with economists suggesting a higher chance of recession in the next year, as products from most countries face a 10% tariff, while products from China face a much steeper levy of up to 145%.</p>

This effort is part of a broader diplomatic campaign to convince various nations, including those with questionable human rights records, to receive deportees from the U.S. The administration has already brokered similar agreements with Latin American countries, such as Costa Rica, Panama, and El Salvador, to accept migrants. One idea under consideration is to use these agreements to deport suspected members of the Tren de Aragua gang, with the U.S. potentially providing financial support to the receiving countries for detaining the deportees.</p>

Despite this move, questions remain about whether an expanded military presence will achieve Israel's goals, as past efforts have not eliminated Hamas or secured all hostages.

The industry is questioning how the duties would be implemented and who would bear the cost, with concerns about the impact on international box office sales and relationships with other countries.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month, adding to concerns about oversupply amidst rising tariffs and recession fears. The decision by the eight producers, led by Saudi Arabia, to boost output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June has led to a significant drop in oil prices. Goldman Sachs has cut its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year, citing high spare capacity and recession risks, while oilfield service firms anticipate a decline in exploration and production investment due to the weak price environment.</p>

          <p>The latest spike in US-Iran tensions has highlighted the difficulties in curbing Iran's oil exports to China, which provide a vital economic lifeline for Tehran. Despite US sanctions, Iran continues to export an estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million barrels of crude per day, primarily to China, using a complex web of clandestine operations. The US has lost leverage over China due to the trade war, diminishing the impact of financial sanctions, and the clandestine nature of these operations makes it exceedingly difficult to intercept the oil flow.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is meeting this week to review monetary policy and interest rates, which could influence the borrowing and saving climate. While a rate cut in May is unlikely, any hints from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about a potential cut in June could lead to a slight decline in mortgage rates. Borrowers should monitor rates daily for opportunities, and buyers should ensure their credit profiles are strong and shop for the best rates. The article analyzes the potential impact of the Fed's decisions on mortgage rates, suggesting that a rate cut is more likely in June but emphasizing the importance of proactive monitoring.</p>

          <p>Drugmakers have warned that Americans would suffer the most if President Trump imposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, as medications would become more expensive and potentially unaffordable. A 25% US tariff on pharmaceutical imports would increase drug costs in the country by almost $51 billion a year, raising prices by up to 12.9% if passed on, according to an analysis by the accountancy firm EY. Some drugmakers are investing in US operations to mitigate the impact, but generic drugmakers, operating on tighter margins, would find it harder to shift production, potentially exacerbating existing drug shortages.</p>
