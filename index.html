          <h2>Study Links Ultraprocessed Food Consumption to Increased Early Mortality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 11:27:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Brazil-led study analyzing dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries has found a direct correlation between higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased risk of premature death. The research, led by Eduardo Nilson at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, emphasizes the importance of assessing whole dietary patterns rather than focusing on individual nutrients. The study highlights that countries with stronger food cultures, such as Japan and Mediterranean nations, have lower rates of premature death attributed to ultraprocessed foods, while the US and UK have particularly high rates. The findings suggest that public policy interventions, including taxes on unhealthy foods and incentives for local food production, are crucial for improving long-term health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Everton Blair, a former member of the Gwinnett County Board of Education, is challenging 12-term Representative David Scott in a primary race, arguing that Congress should not be a "retirement community."

Blair is almost 50 years younger than Scott, and his campaign reflects a growing sentiment that younger leaders are needed to address contemporary issues. Democratic Georgia state Sen.

          <p>US agriculture exporters are reporting significant financial losses due to global backlash against President Trump's tariffs, particularly a decline in Chinese buying of US farm products. The Agriculture Transportation Coalition (AgTC) describes the situation as a "full-blown crisis," citing cancelled export orders and potential layoffs. Data from the US Department of Agriculture reveals China's largest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, halting a shipment of 12,000 tons. The Port of Oakland warns that reduced cargo volume due to tariffs could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that gold prices will likely continue to rise due to economic uncertainty, geopolitical instability, and unpredictable market performance, driving investors to safe-haven assets. While gold prices have already surpassed $3,000 per ounce, reaching $4,000 per ounce this year may require significant economic instability, such as the Federal Reserve dropping interest rates to zero. However, the uncertainty surrounding international tariffs will likely remain a major influencer in gold prices until there is more clarity on their impact. Experts advise investors to approach gold with a long-term mindset, viewing it as a diversifier to protect against rising inflation.</p>

          <p>Settling a debt, which involves paying less than the full amount owed, can negatively impact your credit score in the short term, as it is often marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full" on your credit report. However, settling a seriously delinquent account can be a step towards rebuilding credit over time, as it frees up financial resources to maintain other obligations. Debt management plans and debt consolidation may offer more credit-score-friendly alternatives. Ultimately, the most important factor is to create a plan to manage debt and stick to it.</p>

          <p>Hair loss during menopause is often caused by hormonal shifts, particularly a decline in estrogen levels, which leads to thinner hair follicles. Genetics also play a role, with androgenetic alopecia becoming more prevalent during menopause. To reduce hair loss, experts recommend addressing nutritional deficiencies, using over-the-counter minoxidil topicals, and consulting with a doctor about oral minoxidil or hormone replacement therapy. Gentle hair care practices, stress management, and scalp massages can also help prevent hair loss.</p>

The emergence will occur when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, typically in late April or May in warmer states and May or early June in cooler states. The cicadas will remain above ground for approximately 4 to 6 weeks, engaging in mating rituals and laying eggs before the cycle begins again.
