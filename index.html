          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for 10 games for violating the league's personal conduct policy. The suspension follows an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct from at least 16 massage therapists between 2012 and 2016. Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, denies the allegations but has accepted the resolution to move forward. He remains eligible to sign with a team during his suspension, even while serving the penalty.</p>

As regulatory clarity improves, traditional financial institutions are expected to enter the space, which is currently dominated by Circle and Tether.

In a statement, Child Q expressed enduring trauma from the event, stating she doesn't know if she will "feel normal again."

          <p>A proposal to convert a shuttered 2,500-bed prison in California City into the state's largest immigrant detention center is facing strong opposition. Advocacy groups and some residents argue the facility, operated by private contractor CoreCivic, will fuel a system of incarceration and family separation for profit. While some locals hope for economic benefits like jobs in the high-poverty desert community, opponents are urging the city council to reject the plan. They advocate for investment in community resources rather than a facility that profits from detaining people.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks, signaling a broader move toward deregulation under the Trump administration. The proposal would alter the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, allowing major banks to lend more freely and potentially boosting their profitability and shareholder returns. While bank investors have welcomed the move, some Fed governors dissented, warning that reducing capital cushions could increase systemic risk in the financial system. This is seen as the first step in a wider rollback of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that while communication channels with Iran and intermediaries remain open, no formal meeting has been set. The administration's stated goal for any future talks is to secure a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program from Iran. This follows a recent U.S. military operation targeting Iranian nuclear sites, after which the administration has been pushing for direct diplomacy.</p>

Sanchez accused the EU of applying "double standards," contrasting its inaction on Israel with the 18 sanctions packages imposed on Russia. While Spain and Ireland advocate for suspending the deal, they lack the unanimous support needed from other member states like Germany and Hungary. The EU has only "taken note" of the report, highlighting deep divisions within the bloc on its policy toward Israel.</p>

The planned reforms, which aimed to save Â£5 billion annually, were a key part of the Chancellor's fiscal plans.

          <p>While interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have risen recently, there are three key dates this summer when they could potentially fall. Analysts point to the release of the June inflation report on July 15 and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17 as potential catalysts for a rate reduction. A cooling inflation report or a formal rate cut by the Fed would likely lead to lower variable rates for HELOC borrowers. The September meeting is considered the most probable time for a cut.

The new rules, which Apple says it is implementing to avoid a potential â‚¬500 million fine, include a "core technology commission" on purchases made outside the App Store. Critics like Spotify and Epic Games have accused Apple of "malicious compliance," arguing the new fee structure is designed to make alternative payment systems non-viable.
