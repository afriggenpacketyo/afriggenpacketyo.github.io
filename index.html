          <p>On Sunday morning, thieves conducted a rapid heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing jewelry of what officials call "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators reportedly used a basket lift to access a window, smashed display cases inside the Galerie d'Apollon, and fled the scene within minutes while tourists were already in the museum. The incident prompted an immediate closure of the world-renowned institution and a large-scale police investigation to recover the stolen artifacts, which include pieces from Napoleon's collection. No injuries were reported during the professionally executed theft.</p>

OSU police have stated that there is no ongoing threat to the public but have not released details on the conditions of the victims or whether any suspects are in custody.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on credible intelligence that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This action would represent a severe violation of the recently brokered ceasefire agreement, potentially undermining significant diplomatic progress. While specific details about the timing or location were not provided, the U.S. has informed signatory nations of the peace plan and stated that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's population if the attack proceeds. Hamas has since denied the claims, calling them "false allegations."</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, Charles M. Blow highlights the severe crisis facing local news in the United States, with an average of two newspapers closing each week and newsroom employment collapsing since 2000. The article argues that the loss of these institutions erodes the "connective tissue" of communities, which covers everything from accountability journalism to local announcements and events. This decline contributes to growing political polarization, as nationalized news sources replace the common ground fostered by local media. The piece frames local news not just as a struggling industry but as an essential public good.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stood by his recent comments labeling the nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump as "hate America" rallies. In a television interview, Johnson clarified that his criticism was directed at the "hateful messages" and "violent rhetoric" of the protesters, not the Democratic Party as a whole, despite previously linking them. He cited a perceived rise of Marxism within the Democratic Party as evidence for his concerns about the political climate. The Speaker maintained that his remarks were about the content of the protests rather than the individuals involved.</p>

Previously, visitors from both countries could freely mix within the building, but recent changes now require Canadians to use a separate rear entrance instead of the main U.S.-facing one, unless they first report to a legal port of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection cited "illicit cross-border activity around the library" as the reason, a move local leaders and library officials lament as divisive and contrary to the institution's founding mission of unity.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Qatar and Turkey, with both sides committing to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability. The conflict, the worst since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, escalated after Pakistan was accused of carrying out attacks in Kabul, leading to cross-border strikes that caused dozens of civilian casualties. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support groups attacking Pakistan, and further talks are scheduled.</p>

          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," there have been no major military activities by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the island.

This level of activity is significantly lower than previous large-scale exercises, such as one in April that involved 76 sorties. The current restraint contrasts with Beijing's past actions, where it has used massive drills as a "serious warning" to what it terms "Taiwan independence forces."</p>

Economic analyses cited in the article estimate that the tariffs will cost the average household nearly $2,400 more per year, with the burden of increased corporate expenses shifting to consumers. The personal accounts reflect a growing apprehension about the financial future and contradict administration promises of making life more affordable.</p>

          <p>Georgia's primary utility, Georgia Power, is requesting a massive increase in energy generation capacity, primarily to support the booming construction of datacenters for artificial intelligence. The proposal seeks nearly $16 billion for about 10 additional gigawatts of power, 80% of which is for datacenters, raising concerns among consumer and environmental groups about rising utility bills and increased reliance on fossil fuels. Public hearings are scheduled to address the plan, with advocates calling for datacenters to bear the costs of the expansion and for a greater focus on renewable energy sources. This highlights a growing national conflict over the immense energy needs of the AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a significant spike in orders from the U.S., which the company attributes to clients stockpiling products ahead of President Trump's threatened 100% tariff on Chinese imports. The company received over 1,000 new orders in a single week, with clients explicitly citing the need to avoid potential price hikes, forcing the firm's factories to work overtime. A company source humorously thanked Trump for acting as a "sales consultant," noting that the current rush of "emergency purchases" is far greater than what was seen during previous tariff threats.

          <p>AI safety-focused startup Anthropic finds itself at odds with the Trump administration's approach to regulating artificial intelligence, drawing public criticism from the president's AI czar, David Sacks. Sacks has accused Anthropic of a "sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering," particularly opposing the company's support for state-level AI rules, which the administration sought to preempt. This contrasts with rival OpenAI, which has partnered with the White House on a major AI infrastructure initiative. The conflict highlights a fundamental ideological split in Silicon Valley over how to balance rapid innovation against potential AI risks.</p>

          <p>As the Medicare open enrollment period begins, experts are urging beneficiaries to carefully compare their coverage options for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. The article outlines the key choices available, such as switching between original Medicare and a private Medicare Advantage plan, or changing Part D prescription drug coverage. It highlights the importance of checking for changes in costs, provider networks, and drug formularies, as these can significantly impact out-of-pocket spending.

Liu defended China's retaliatory fees on U.S. ships as a necessary measure to protect its own industry's interests.

While she has avoided direct criticism of President Trump, her independent streak has won her unlikely praise from some Democrats and fueled speculation about her motives and political future. The article suggests her actions may stem from a populist desire to align with her constituents' concerns or from personal ambition after being reportedly discouraged from a statewide run.</p>

Advocates point to recent federal budget cuts to Medicaid as having a devastating impact on autistic people who rely on these services for daily living support.

          <p>The rising popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant increase in related eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that the number of injuries, such as corneal abrasions and lacerations, has been growing by over 400 cases annually, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized eye protection guidelines for the sport, noting that proper eyewear can prevent up to 90% of such injuries. Experts suggest that many players are simply unaware of the risks posed by the fast-paced game.</p>

          <p>Roman Surovtsev, who arrived in the U.S. as a refugee from the former Soviet Union at age four, was recently detained by ICE during a routine check-in, reigniting a years-long deportation effort. Because he left before the fall of the Soviet Union, neither Ukraine nor Russia can confirm his citizenship, making deportation legally complex. His lawyers argue his detention is unconstitutional as there is no significant likelihood of his removal, especially after his prior criminal conviction, which led to his green card being revoked, was recently vacated. His case highlights the legal and human complexities faced by stateless individuals.</p>
