          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a major legislative package championed by President Trump, which he has now signed into law. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increases funding for border security and defense, and is paid for by significant cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs like Medicaid and SNAP. While Republicans project economic benefits, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance. The legislation passed narrowly along party lines using the budget reconciliation process. (not investment advice)</p>

Seven individuals, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work, remain unaccounted for following the incident. Investigations revealed the facility was operating without the necessary local permits to store commercial fireworks on the agricultural property.

          <p>Severe thunderstorms have caused devastating flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas, resulting in at least 13 fatalities. The rapidly rising waters, which swelled over 22 feet in a few hours, also left more than 20 girls missing from a local summer camp, Camp Mystic. Authorities have initiated a large-scale search and rescue operation involving helicopters and hundreds of emergency personnel. The disaster struck with little warning, preventing evacuations, as months' worth of rain fell on parched land in a very short period.</p>

          <p>Merit Street Media, the media company founded by Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection less than two years after its launch.

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in Kolhapur, India, after releasing a line of sandals closely resembling the traditional Kolhapuri design without attribution. The controversy has highlighted the struggles of the local artisans, who handcraft the sandals for a fraction of luxury prices and face challenges from rising costs and competition. While some hope the global attention could benefit the craft, industry associations and politicians are now seeking better recognition and financial compensation for the artisans' cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A recent public display of emotion by a UK politician has sparked a debate about the acceptability of crying in the workplace. While traditional views often label it as unprofessional or a sign of weakness, many modern career coaches and executives argue it reflects emotional intelligence and strength. The article explores different perspectives, noting that biases still exist, particularly for women and senior leaders. Ultimately, it suggests that how an individual recovers and the overall workplace culture are more critical than the act of crying itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change. These creatures undertake a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking deep into the ocean to burn the stored fat. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from warming the atmosphere. The findings highlight a much larger role for these organisms in regulating the global climate than previously understood.</p>

The fraudsters allegedly monitor a public list of unclaimed estates, then produce forged wills naming themselves as heirs to steal assets, including properties worth millions. The report highlights significant weaknesses in the digital probate system, which appears to enable the fraud and tax evasion by not adequately scrutinizing claims.

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will change policies at America's national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international tourists. The order also directs that any revenue from these increased fees be used for park infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the directive revokes a 2017 Obama-era memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within national parks. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over 20 years of experience advises parents on five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health.

He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation and train unhealthy taste preferences.

          <p>Health advocates and experts are raising concerns that the wide variety of names for Medicaid programs across different states could lead to widespread confusion. With millions of people facing potential loss of coverage due to new eligibility requirements, many may not realize that notices apply to them. State-specific branding, such as "Medi-Cal" in California or "Husky Health" in Connecticut, means beneficiaries might not recognize that they are enrolled in the federal Medicaid program. This confusion could prevent them from taking necessary steps to maintain their health insurance.</p>
