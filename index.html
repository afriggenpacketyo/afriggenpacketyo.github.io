          <h2>Trump's 50% Copper Tariff Includes Key Exemption, But Price Hikes Still Expected</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 10:42:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new 50% tariff on copper contains a significant exemption for raw materials like copper cathode, which initially caused U.S. market prices to drop sharply. However, the tariff still applies to semi-finished products such as pipes, wires, and electrical components, which are crucial for manufacturing. Analysts predict that despite the exemption, the cost of consumer goods like air conditioners, plumbing parts, and electronics will likely rise as manufacturers pass on the increased expense of these essential components. The policy is intended to boost the domestic copper production industry, but its nuanced application continues to create market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner attributed the success to a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna, which has been managing high medical costs, and to operational efficiencies in its pharmacies. This positive report marks the third full quarter under Joyner's leadership as the company continues its broader turnaround plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Expresses Skepticism Over Trump's Tariff Authority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 10:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has reviewed arguments concerning President Donald Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The case challenges Trump's use of the 1977 law to set a global 10% tariff baseline, an action previously blocked by a lower court before the appeals court temporarily reinstated it. Challengers, including several states and businesses, argue this usurps Congress's constitutional power to set tariffs and violates legal principles like the major questions doctrine. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool for national security and economic negotiations, with the case's outcome likely heading to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Royal experts confirm that Althorp, Princess Diana's childhood home and final resting place, will not be inherited by her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. Due to the tradition of primogeniture within the Spencer family, the estate is set to pass to Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, and subsequently to his eldest son, Louis Spencer. This practice dictates that titles and property are inherited by the eldest male heir, bypassing Louis's three older sisters. The rule, while seen by some as outdated, is a long-standing tradition for the Althorp estate, which has been in the Spencer family since 1508.</p>

          <p>High Noon is recalling some of its vodka seltzer variety packs after discovering they contain cans of the alcoholic beverage that were mislabeled as Celsius energy drinks. The mix-up occurred at a third-party packaging supplier, where empty Celsius cans were mistakenly sent to High Noon's production facility and filled with vodka seltzer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about the recall, which affects specific lots distributed in six states, due to the risk of unintentional alcohol consumption. Consumers are advised to check lot codes and can lid colors to identify the affected products.</p>

          <p>An Irish appeals court has dismissed MMA fighter Conor McGregor's appeal against a civil court ruling that found he sexually assaulted Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel in 2018. The court upheld the original verdict, which ordered McGregor to pay £206,000 in damages. McGregor's legal team had argued that his "no comment" police interviews were improperly presented to the jury and that a key question was poorly worded. The three-judge panel rejected these arguments, allowing the victim, Ms. Hand, to finally move forward after a prolonged legal battle.</p>

The company, which was valued at $19.3 billion after pricing its IPO at $33 per share, is moving forward after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>As Apple prepares for its upcoming earnings report, the company faces significant investor concerns that have driven its stock down over 16% in 2025. To reverse this trend, analysts suggest Apple must address three key areas: provide positive news on trade and supply chain diversification away from China, deliver better-than-feared services revenue amid legal challenges, and offer more clarity on its generative AI strategy. The company's lagging AI rollout, ongoing tariff uncertainties, and legal battles have created major headwinds, and a strong performance in these areas is seen as crucial for restoring Wall Street's confidence.

          <h2>Germany's Busiest Rail Route Between Berlin and Hamburg to Close for Nine Months</h2>

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, is closing the country's busiest train route between Berlin and Hamburg for at least nine months, starting August 1. The 174-mile line, used by up to 30,000 passengers daily, will undergo a complete renovation as part of a massive, nationwide project to overhaul Germany's dilapidated rail infrastructure. The closure will force long-distance trains onto lengthy detours and require 170 daily buses to service intermediate towns. This drastic measure reflects the deep crisis facing the rail system after decades of underinvestment, which has led to widespread delays and operational instability.</p>

Strong performance from its film studios and theme parks, along with growth in its Peacock streaming service, helped offset the broadband and pay-TV declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif proposes the creation of a Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement (Menara). This regional body would facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation in areas like energy, medicine, and agriculture among member states that reject nuclear weapons and agree to mutual verification. Zarif argues that after decades of paralysis on creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone, this initiative offers a new path forward, allowing the region to take control of its own security. He contends that such cooperation can build trust and enhance non-proliferation without waiting for Israeli disarmament, which has blocked progress for 50 years.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig. Prosecutors argued that the 47-year-old, who was having an affair and facing financial difficulties, poisoned his wife's protein shakes with arsenic and then administered a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in the hospital. Evidence presented during the trial included his online search history for lethal poison doses and the delivery of potassium cyanide to his dental office. The jury found him guilty, and one of the couple's six children delivered a victim impact statement at the sentencing.</p>
