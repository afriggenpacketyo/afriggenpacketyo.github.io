          <p>Following the death of Giorgio Armani at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on his dual legacy as both a revolutionary fashion designer and a masterful business leader. He successfully built a multi-billion dollar empire by maintaining creative control and adhering to a consistent vision of accessible, quiet luxury. Armani's expansion from high fashion into a wide range of lifestyle products, including perfumes, home furnishings, and even chocolates, was unified by his sophisticated design ethos. His strategic use of celebrity endorsements and the creation of the iconic 'power suit' for both men and women cemented his brand's cultural and commercial dominance.</p>

          <p>Current employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are publicly urging Americans to trust the nation's economic data, asserting that their work is guided by law and statistical practice, not partisan influence. This statement follows President Trump's firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a weak July jobs report, which he claimed without evidence was rigged. The employees, who remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, defended the standard practice of data revisions and vowed to continue publishing reliable information regardless of political pressure. Their reassurance comes as the latest report shows continued weakness in the job market.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching competition laws by abusing its dominant position in the online advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google unfairly favored its own advertising exchange, AdX, over rivals, leading to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. The Commission has ordered Google to cease these anti-competitive practices and has warned that a structural remedy, such as selling parts of its ad tech business, may be necessary. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal the fine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to initiate a Section 301 trade investigation in response to what he terms "discriminatory" fines levied by the European Union against American tech giants like Google and Apple. Following the EU's recent €2.95 billion fine on Google, Trump stated his administration would not allow such actions to stand, claiming they unfairly penalize taxpaying American companies and divert money from U.S. investments. He specifically called out fines and back taxes imposed on Apple as well, asserting the company should have its money returned and vowing to nullify the penalties.</p>

          <p>The large, 32-foot-tall "LAX" sign at the entrance to Los Angeles International Airport is being temporarily dismantled to accommodate a major roadway reconfiguration project. The construction aims to improve traffic flow, enhance pedestrian access, and create more direct routes to parking ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Summer Olympics. Airport officials state the project is a key part of a broader modernization program designed to create a more efficient, world-class airport experience.

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have arrested nearly 500 people in a large-scale raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle factory site in Georgia, marking the largest workplace enforcement action of President Trump's second term. The majority of those detained are South Korean nationals, prompting the South Korean government to express "concern and regret" and urge the U.S. to respect their citizens' rights. Homeland Security officials stated the raid was the result of a multi-month criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, not simply an immigration sweep. The event highlights potential conflicts between the administration's goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and its stringent immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has created confusion, with new questions arising from a review of her real estate records. Kugler resigned on August 1, months before her term's end, without offering an explanation, deepening the mystery around her departure. The situation is amplified by the Trump administration's recent campaign to oust another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, over alleged mortgage fraud, a charge Cook denies. A review of Kugler's own records reveals inconsistencies regarding her primary residence, though she has stated the discrepancy is a county clerical error, and there is no indication of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its largest one-day drop since August 2024, after the release of a weaker-than-expected jobs report. This decline provides some relief for potential homebuyers facing high home prices, as the lower rate can reduce monthly payments by a noticeable amount. However, it remains uncertain if this drop will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained sluggish. Some analysts suggest that rates would need to fall into the 5% range to truly stimulate buyer activity amid ongoing economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is seen as an attempt by the prime minister to seize a moment of crisis and re-energize his government, which has faced declining approval ratings.

An accountancy administrator was awarded over £14,000 after being fired for unfair dismissal when her employer used spy software to track her computer usage. The judge noted that the time spent on personal matters was not excessive, a large portion was used for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against it. The ruling suggests the dismissal was motivated by the owner's desire to remove the employee before she could claim unfair dismissal rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lululemon's shares fell by 20% after the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings forecast, citing a projected $240 million negative impact from U.S. tariffs. While second-quarter earnings beat estimates, revenue slightly missed, and the company's outlook was far below Wall Street expectations. The CEO acknowledged that changes to tariff regulations, including the removal of the 'de minimis' exemption for smaller shipments, played a large part in the guidance reduction. The company also admitted its product offerings in casual categories have become "stale" and predictable, contributing to a slowdown in U.S. sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between Israel and Egypt have escalated, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu accusing Egypt of imprisoning Gaza residents who wish to flee the war zone. This came after Egypt's Foreign Minister declared that the displacement of Palestinians is a "red line" and that Egypt would not allow it to happen. The Egyptian minister also repeated accusations of genocide against Israel, describing the situation as mass killing and artificial starvation. The diplomatic clash occurs as the Israeli military continues its offensive in Gaza City, which it says is aimed at defeating Hamas terrorists in the area.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again suggested he is considering revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time adversary, comedian Rosie O'Donnell. In a social media post, Trump called her "not a Great American" and a "Threat to Humanity," stating that he is giving "serious thought" to the action. O'Donnell, who confirmed in March that she had moved to Ireland due to the political climate in the U.S., responded on Instagram by referencing the TV show "Succession." The feud between the two dates back years, famously escalating during a 2015 presidential debate.</p>

The event has spurred numerous themed parties, tribute band performances, and a pop-up merchandise shop, transforming parts of L.A. into a hub for Anglophiles.

The freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction along a 10.2-mile stretch between Van Nuys and Westwood, and transportation officials are urging motorists to find alternate routes. The $143.7 million project, which will ultimately restore 92 lane-miles and require up to 25 weekend closures, is scheduled for completion in winter 2028-2029.

          <p>President Donald Trump has increased the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year, a significant change from the $10,000 limit imposed by his 2017 tax law. The SALT deduction, which primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states, allows itemizers to deduct state and local income and property taxes from their federal tax liability. Proponents argue the higher cap reduces double taxation, while critics point to the substantial cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

          <p>In response to the dismantling of U.S. vaccine infrastructure by HHS Secretary Robert F.

Public health experts warn that this fracturing of a unified national approach to immunization, while necessary to counter misinformation from HHS, is a dangerous experiment that could take generations to repair and leave the country vulnerable to disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," its historical name prior to 1947. Trump stated the name "Department of War" has a "stronger sound" and is associated with a time when the U.S. "used to win wars all the time." The original name change in 1947 was a deliberate move under President Truman to reflect a post-WWII focus on deterring conflicts in the nuclear age, not just waging them. Critics worry the symbolic change signals a more bellicose foreign policy, while some supporters argue it simply acknowledges the reality of the department's role.</p>

The breakthrough came after the Ventura County Sheriff's Office tested old evidence kits, and the resulting DNA profile was matched across multiple states through a national database. Investigative genealogy identified McNulty as a potential suspect, and his involvement was confirmed by matching the crime scene evidence to a biological sample collected from him during a 1997 investigation. Authorities are now working to notify the victims and investigate whether McNulty may have committed other crimes.</p>
