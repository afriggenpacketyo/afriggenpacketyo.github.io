            <h2>Trump's Social Media Post Preceded Tariff Pause, Benefiting Investors</h2>

            <p>President Trump's social media post suggesting it was a "great time to buy" stocks preceded his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause, leading to market gains and raising questions about potential insider trading. Stocks soared, with the S&P 500 recovering a significant portion of its recent losses. Trump Media's stock, DJT, also saw a substantial increase. Ethics experts suggest the post, and Trump's ambiguous answer on when he decided on the pause, warrant investigation, although action is unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes decisions regarding phone bans in schools should be made by head teachers, not mandated by the government. Her survey shows that the vast majority of schools already limit phone use. De Souza emphasizes the importance of parental involvement in managing children's screen time and calls on technology companies to ensure online safety. She also recommends further research into the potential benefits of broader restrictions on children's phone use, particularly social media.</p>

            <p>Paul Mullin, Wrexham's star striker, is facing challenges this season after undergoing back surgery. His start to the season was delayed, and he has missed chances, resulting in only nine starts. His goal-scoring record is significantly worse compared to previous seasons. The arrival of new strikers has further limited his playing time. Despite his past successes, Mullin's current form and the team's new additions have made it difficult for him to secure a spot in the starting lineup.</p>

            <p>Eathan Cooper, a 24-year-old from Cambridgeshire, experienced a nightmare scenario after becoming a victim of car cloning, receiving numerous fines for traffic violations he did not commit.

He had to spend hundreds of pounds and go to court to resolve the issue, and eventually purchased a new license plate. After the BBC contacted TfL, they apologized and cancelled the penalties.</p>

            <p>Analysts caution that Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, excluding China, does not signal a shift in his overall objectives. Tariffs on Chinese imports have been raised to 125%, intensifying the trade war between the two largest economies. Experts express concern about the impact on global supply chains. A report notes that the current tariffs could generate significant tax revenue, but this would drop to zero if China stops exporting. The situation is described as "chaotic" and "crazy."</p>
