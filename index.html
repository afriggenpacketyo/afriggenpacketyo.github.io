          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived in Illinois to protect federal immigration facilities, sparking a lawsuit from Illinois and Chicago officials seeking to block the deployment. State and local leaders claim a lack of communication from the Trump administration regarding the troops' mission, which they view as an aggressive overreach. A federal judge in Chicago declined an immediate halt but scheduled a hearing, while a federal judge in Oregon approved a temporary restraining order against a similar deployment there. This article highlights the political theater and legal complexities surrounding federal immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts explained his decision to initially hold back ace reliever Roki Sasaki in Game 2 of the NLDS, opting for Blake Treinen instead. Roberts cited Sasaki's workload management, given his recent return from injury and limited experience in a relief role. The strategy nearly backfired, leading Sasaki to enter the game for the final out anyway. Moving forward, Sasaki is confirmed as the primary option for save situations, though his usage will remain carefully balanced throughout the postseason due to his unique circumstances.</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, only the third confirmed to enter our solar system, was recently photographed closely approaching Mars by two European Space Agency orbiters. The images captured the faint, fuzzy white dot of the comet moving against distant stars, approximately 18.6 million miles from Mars. Scientists will continue analyzing data from the orbiters to detect the comet, which poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.

          <p>President Trump has again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a federal law permitting the president to deploy military forces on U.S. soil to quell domestic uprisings. This article explains the centuries-old law, which allows troops to perform civilian law enforcement duties, generally prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act. Legal experts highlight that while courts are reluctant to challenge such declarations, the move raises risks of force and could precede more aggressive deployments. The act has been used dozens of times historically, but its application remains highly controversial due to civil liberties concerns.</p>
