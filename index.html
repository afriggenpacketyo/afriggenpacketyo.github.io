          <p>Construction workers in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district discovered a 1,000-pound American bomb from World War II, leading to the evacuation of approximately 6,000 people from 1,900 households. Police bomb disposal experts successfully defused the ordnance in an operation that lasted from Friday night until Saturday morning, ensuring no injuries occurred. The discovery highlights the lingering dangers of wartime remnants in the city, which was a target of Allied air raids against Japanese forces during the war.</p>

The order, effective September 21, aims to encourage hiring American workers but has drawn sharp criticism from legal and business communities. They warn it will harm U.S. competitiveness and devastate small businesses, prompting major tech companies to advise affected employees to return to the U.S. immediately. (not investment advice)</p>

A minimally invasive procedure to place a stent in the affected artery successfully restored blood flow and allowed him to return to his normal life, enjoying meals and family time again.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned following pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. The resignation occurred after a months-long mortgage fraud investigation into James, a political adversary of President Trump, failed to produce an indictment. This development has intensified concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department and the use of prosecutorial power for political retribution, eroding norms of departmental independence.</p>

          <p>According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average math and reading scores for American 12th graders have fallen to their lowest levels in decades. The results show reading scores are lower than in 1992, while math scores are at their lowest since 2005, with a growing percentage of students performing below the "basic" achievement level. Experts attribute the "sobering" decline to a combination of factors, including chronic absenteeism that worsened during the pandemic and a broader trend of student disengagement.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, widely regarded as the greatest pitcher of his generation, has announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw was the franchise's guiding light, leading the team through a period of turmoil and bankruptcy to an era of sustained success, including 13 consecutive postseason berths. His remarkable career includes three Cy Young Awards and the lowest ERA of any pitcher with as many innings in the last century, cementing his legacy as a Dodgers icon.</p>

          <p>For over a decade, Robert Fortunato's remodeled "Green Idea House" in Hermosa Beach, California, has produced more energy than it consumes, showcasing a sustainable living model built for less than a standard remodel. By eliminating natural gas and installing rooftop solar panels, the all-electric home powers itself and two electric cars, saving the family thousands annually in utility bills. The design incorporates passive energy-saving features like strategic roof overhangs and a "thermal chimney" for cooling, proving that off-the-shelf technologies and smart planning can create an environmentally friendly home.</p>

          <p>The 190th edition of Oktoberfest, the world's largest beer and folk festival, officially began in Munich with the traditional tapping of the first beer keg by Mayor Dieter Reiter. The 16-day event is expected to attract over six million visitors to the Theresienwiese fairground, where they will enjoy beer, traditional Bavarian food, and amusement rides. Despite record-high beer prices this year, the festival opened under sunny skies, with officials hoping it offers a period of "pure high spirits" amid a time of multiple crises.</p>

          <p>Following the killing of Charlie Kirk, immigrant advocacy organizations are bracing for a federal crackdown after top Trump administration officials threatened to prosecute non-profit groups they deem "leftwing." Aides like Stephen Miller have vowed to hold organizations "criminally liable" for what they baselessly call "coordinated attacks," and DHS has expanded its definition of threats to include filming ICE operations. In response, activists are exercising caution while affirming their First Amendment rights to observe and document immigration enforcement, anticipating an escalation of the administration's efforts to create an "atmosphere of fear."</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the Trump administration is exploiting the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk to launch a campaign of vengeance against its political opponents. In the days following the shooting, the White House has escalated threats against "radical left" groups, considering domestic terrorism designations without evidence linking them to the crime. Critics warn this response mirrors authoritarian playbooks, using a tragedy as a pretext to crush dissent, undermine the Democratic party, and erode free speech, turning collective grief into a tool for political retribution.</p>

While China's program is reportedly on track, concerns are growing that funding cuts and delays in NASA's Artemis program could jeopardize American leadership in this new space race.</p>

          <p>A dramatic anti-corruption movement, largely fueled by Gen Z activists, has led to the overthrow of Nepal's government and the appointment of the country's first female prime minister, Sushila Karki. The turmoil erupted after the government suspended social media amid a youth-led campaign exposing the lavish lifestyles of politicians' families, culminating in violent protests that forced Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli to resign. This upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-driven frustration with corruption and economic inequality across South Asia.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is implementing a new policy requiring journalists to sign a pledge promising not to gather any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially authorized for release. According to U.S. officials, reporters who fail to comply with this rule will have their press credentials revoked, effectively cutting off their access to the Department of Defense headquarters. This move represents a significant change in media relations and raises serious concerns about press freedom and the public's access to information regarding the U.S. military.</p>
