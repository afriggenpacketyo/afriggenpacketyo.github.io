        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of states and immigrant advocacy groups urged the Supreme Court to reject President Trump's request to overturn a nationwide injunction against his executive order ending birthright citizenship.  Multiple lower courts have blocked the policy, citing its likely unconstitutionality. Trump argues that the nationwide injunctions impede presidential authority. The states contend that upholding the existing legal interpretation, in place for over 125 years, is not an emergency requiring a stay.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to increase the cost of U.S.-made airplanes and aerospace products, jeopardizing a sector that significantly contributes to the U.S. trade surplus.  The Aerospace Industries Association is urging the administration to uphold a long-standing trade agreement that allows duty-free trade of civilian aircraft.  Boeing and other industry leaders express concern about the impact on exports and jobs. The tariffs could lead to higher prices for consumers.</p>
