        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential U.S. government shutdown could cause major disruptions for air travelers and create financial losses for the travel industry, particularly if it becomes prolonged. Although essential employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are mandated to work, they will do so without receiving pay, a situation that has historically led to higher rates of sick calls and subsequent staffing shortages. Previous shutdowns that extended beyond two weeks resulted in significantly longer airport security lines and flight delays as unpaid federal workers began to face severe financial strain. The U.S. Travel Association also warns that a shutdown could cost the national economy $1 billion per week and impede the hiring of new air traffic controllers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass necessary funding legislation before the fiscal year deadline. A shutdown occurs when agencies lack authorized funding, forcing them to cease all non-essential functions, furloughing many federal employees while essential personnel must work without immediate pay. While entitlement programs like Social Security continue, other services may face delays or interruptions, and national parks could close. The economic impact can be substantial, with the last major shutdown in 2018-2019 costing the economy billions of dollars and causing significant hardship for federal workers and contractors who rely on government operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the failure of Congress to secure a funding deal, the U.S. government shutdown will require active-duty military service members to continue their duties without pay until the impasse is resolved. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown ends, military pay is not guaranteed unless a separate act is passed, which has not yet occurred. This places significant financial strain on military families, prompting financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA to offer 0% APR loans to affected members. The Defense Department has also outlined its priority missions, though some non-essential services like elective medical procedures will be delayed.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, the nation's 74 million Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks without interruption. This is because the program is covered by mandatory spending that does not require annual congressional approval. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will lead to the furloughing of some staff and the suspension of non-essential services. According to the agency's contingency plan, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards will be halted, potentially causing significant inconvenience for many beneficiaries seeking assistance.</p>

          <p>A high-rise apartment building in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx experienced a partial collapse following a reported explosion on Wednesday morning. Video footage from the scene shows a large, gaping hole along one entire corner of the 20-story building, with debris scattered across the street below. The FDNY responded to the incident at the Mitchel Houses complex, indicating that a possible gas explosion may have caused the building's incinerator shaft to collapse.

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggesting the U.S. military could use American cities as training grounds have drawn sharp reactions from congressional leaders. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the remarks, stating they were "cherry-picked" and demonstrated the president's commitment to addressing crime. In contrast, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the statement "deeply disturbing," emphasizing that the military's role is to protect against external threats, not to view American citizens as targets. The debate follows the president's assertion that he threatened to deploy forces to Democratic-run cities to "straighten them out," reigniting concerns over the domestic use of military power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attributed the increase in small boat arrivals across the English Channel to Brexit, specifically citing the UK's departure from the Dublin III regulation. This EU agreement had previously allowed the UK to return some asylum seekers to the first European country they entered. Data shows that before the Brexit referendum, the UK returned more people under this rule than it received, though the numbers were relatively small. Migration experts suggest that leaving the Dublin agreement, along with losing access to the EU's fingerprint database, has made the UK a more attractive destination for migrants, contributing to the record-high number of crossings.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, largely fueled by strong demand for its electric vehicles and large SUVs. The automaker's all-electric vehicle sales surged by 30.2%, setting a new quarterly record, while sales of its larger SUVs also saw significant gains. This growth is part of a broader industry trend, with overall EV sales expected to hit a record high for the quarter as consumers moved to purchase vehicles before federal incentives expired in September. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that EV sales likely reached 410,000 units in the third quarter, representing a record 10% market share.</p>

Missing this window can result in being denied coverage or facing significantly higher premiums later, especially if one's health deteriorates.

Flacco, 40, has posted a league-low 60.3 passer rating and thrown six interceptions through the first four games.

          <p>As the federal government entered a shutdown, Republican lawmakers have placed the blame squarely on Democrats for failing to pass a short-term funding bill. GOP leaders argue that Democrats forced the crisis by insisting on attaching healthcare provisions to the funding measure, thereby holding the government hostage to advance their own agenda. The shutdown has resulted in the suspension of some federal services and requires essential workers, including military personnel, to work without immediate pay. Republicans contend they sought a clean continuing resolution to keep the government open while negotiations continued, but that Democrats refused to compromise on their demands.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again politically outmaneuvered U.S. President Donald Trump, resulting in a Gaza peace plan that heavily favors Israel. The proposed deal, announced after months of continued conflict, is framed as an ultimatum for Hamas to surrender rather than a genuine ceasefire, allowing Israeli troops to remain in Gaza indefinitely. The author contends that Netanyahu has consistently prolonged the war and obstructed negotiations, exploiting Trump's political desires to secure a plan close to his own goal of "total victory." The piece suggests this dynamic has made the U.S. more complicit in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Internet connectivity was restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, ending a nationwide shutdown imposed by the Taliban government that lasted for more than 48 hours. The unexplained blackout paralyzed the country, disabling digital communications, halting flights due to offline air traffic control systems, and blocking access to banking services. The Taliban has not provided any official reason for the shutdown or its subsequent restoration. The outage drew criticism from the United Nations, which warned that it was exacerbating the country's severe humanitarian crisis by disrupting vital services and threatening economic stability in the already struggling nation.</p>

          <p>Recently digitized U.S. military records are shedding new light on gruesome human experiments conducted by Japanese doctors on Western prisoners of war during World War II. A researcher uncovered testimony detailing horrific procedures, such as a Japanese doctor repeatedly injecting prisoners with soy milk to observe the effects, which included seizures and death. This evidence, long held in archives but rarely examined, is being highlighted by the non-profit Pacific Atrocities Education. The organization aims to raise awareness in the United States about the atrocities committed in the Pacific theater, a part of the war's history that often receives less attention than the European front.</p>

          <p>The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is issuing a reminder to drivers in Oakland County to pull all the way up to the stop line when encountering a red light at the new freeway ramp meters. These traffic signals were recently installed on eight entrance ramps along the I-96 Flex Route to help manage the flow of traffic and reduce congestion by breaking up platoons of merging vehicles. For the system to work correctly, vehicles must trigger sensors located at the white stop bar. MDOT is installing temporary signs to educate drivers on the new rules, which are intended to improve traffic flow and reduce crashes.</p>

          <p>England captain Harry Kane is enjoying a remarkable start to his career at Bayern Munich, having scored 17 goals in his first nine games for the German champions. His prolific form has already set records, as he became the fastest player this century to score 100 goals for a single club in one of Europe's top five leagues, achieving the milestone in just 104 games. Kane's initial goal tally outpaces the best starts of superstars like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and former Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski.

          <p>Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a tense exchange with a reporter from LindellTV who confronted her about the government shutdown and Democratic priorities. The reporter repeatedly asked if Democrats were prioritizing "healthcare for illegal aliens" over keeping the government open, prompting a sharp rebuke from the congresswoman. Waters accused the reporter of pushing a false narrative, stating, "This is the kind of journalism we don’t need." She asserted that Democrats want to provide healthcare for everyone and are seeking a bipartisan agreement to fund the government, calling the reporter's line of questioning divisive and an attempt to stir controversy.</p>

Bermuda's government has issued a hurricane warning and urged residents to take the threat seriously, emphasizing that it is not a minor storm. Swells generated by Imelda are also affecting much of the U.S. East Coast, creating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.</p>

          <p>A British High Court has ordered the company PPE Medpro to repay the government over £121 million ($163 million) for breaching its contract to supply sterile surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The judge ruled that the 25 million gowns supplied by the firm, which is linked to entrepreneur Michelle Mone, were not sterile and therefore could not be used by the National Health Service. This case has become symbolic of the vast sums of public money wasted on hastily awarded contracts through a fast-track procurement process. The new Labour government welcomed the ruling as a victory in its efforts to claw back funds lost to pandemic-related fraud and contract failures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar weakened against major rival currencies on Wednesday following the failure of lawmakers to prevent a government shutdown, raising concerns among traders about the potential economic fallout. The dollar index fell by 0.2%, contributing to a 10% decline for the year 2025, which would mark its largest annual loss in 22 years. Historically, government shutdowns have corresponded with a weaker dollar, particularly against safe-haven currencies like the yen and euro. The increased political uncertainty in the U.S. is expected to add further downward pressure on the currency, contributing to a rally in dollar-denominated assets like gold.

After starting as a Vogue model, Miller moved behind the camera, collaborating with Man Ray and developing her own distinct surrealist style.

          <p>Recent turmoil in late-night television, including the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and a temporary suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", has been amplified by President Donald Trump's vocal criticism. The president has also called for NBC's late-night shows to be next, creating an uncertain environment for a programming block that remains valuable to advertisers seeking to reach engaged, live audiences. While traditional TV viewership has declined, late-night shows are one of the few remaining staples of live programming alongside news and sports. The added political pressure could further strain the economics of these shows, creating more challenges for media companies and advertisers.</p>

This new requirement is aimed at ending the frustrating "8am scramble" where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines to secure a consultation. However, the rollout has been met with some challenges, as many patients report that their local surgeries are either unaware of the change or have no available slots online. The British Medical Association has also warned that the system could be overwhelmed, potentially leading to missed diagnoses without proper safeguards in place.</p>

          <p>New legislation signed by President Trump has implemented a series of new and increased fees for immigrants, which advocates say are creating insurmountable financial barriers for asylum seekers and other vulnerable individuals. Among the changes is a new $100 fee to apply for asylum, with additional charges for each year a case is pending, and a new $550 fee for an initial work permit, which was previously free. Immigration lawyers argue that these costs are devastating for low-income refugees who arrive with nothing and are now unable to afford to file for protection or legal employment. Critics contend the fees are designed as a deterrent to discourage people from pursuing their legal rights.</p>
