          <p>After a two-month Israeli blockade, the U.N. reports that approximately 90 truckloads of supplies have arrived at warehouses and other sites in Gaza, marking the first substantial influx of aid to the devastated territory. The article notes the dire humanitarian crisis that has developed during the blockade, emphasizing the critical need for food and other essential resources. This delivery is a significant step towards alleviating the suffering of the Gazan population, though the long-term impact and sustained access to aid remain uncertain. The resumption of aid comes amid increasing international pressure on Israel to ease restrictions on the territory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining current foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard's leadership permitted harassment and physical assault, particularly against Jewish students, by foreign agitators. Harvard has denounced the revocation as unlawful and retaliatory, emphasizing its commitment to international students who enrich the university.

          <p>A 32-year-old man has been arrested after a train collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Herefordshire, U.K., resulting in injuries to two people and significant disruption to rail services. The British Transport Police are investigating the circumstances leading up to the crash, which involved a farm track crossing used by agricultural vehicles. Passengers on board the train described the experience as frightening, with screaming and shaking, but thankfully, most escaped serious injury. This incident follows a recent investigation into safety system faults on a train involved in a fatal crash last year.</p>

Previously, the Navy used its own search terms, leading to the removal of titles like Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

          <p>During a tense meeting in the White House, Donald Trump confronted President Cyril Ramaphosa with contested claims about violence against white farmers in South Africa. Trump played a video falsely depicting crosses as burial sites of murdered white farmers and repeated claims of a "white genocide." BBC Verify's fact-check reveals the crosses were part of a memorial, not a burial site, and that while South Africa has a high murder rate, figures don't support claims of "white genocide." Trump also played footage of rallies where participants sang "Kill the Boer," a song South African courts have deemed can be legally sung at rallies.</p>

The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts, eliminates taxes on tips and overtime (through 2028), and allows tax deductions on auto loan interest for U.S.-assembled cars. It also includes Medicaid restrictions, increases the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, and allocates $46.5 billion for border security.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are nearing passage of a bill that would impose work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. The bill would require able-bodied adults without children to report at least 80 hours of work or community activity monthly to maintain benefits, starting at the end of 2026. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people would lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to this and other provisions. The Medicaid population can be hard to reach, and additional reporting requirements tend to lead to more people losing benefits.</p>

The U.S. government has had to pay more to borrow in global debt markets, spooking markets and causing yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries to spike. The European Central Bank warned that President Trump's tariffs are putting the global financial system at risk, and Moody's downgraded the creditworthiness of the United States, citing the mounting national deficit.

          <p>Bitcoin has continued its rally, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The price surge is attributed to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value like bitcoin. Positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers are also contributing factors. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic reports on a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., where two Israeli embassy staff members were killed, allegedly by a man who shouted, "Free Palestine!" The article argues that the perpetrator's actions, like those of Hamas, expose the lie of his words, revealing anti-Semitism disguised as support for the Palestinian cause. The author contends that neither Palestine nor Israel will be free until their societies are liberated from individuals who commit heinous acts in their name and that anti-Jewish prejudice must be confronted by society at large.</p>

          <p>Despite the resumption of aid deliveries to Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent warns that the supplies are not reaching civilians, risking chaos and violence. Although Israel has allowed aid into the territory after a nearly three-month blockade, the UN expresses frustration with the scale and pace of deliveries, with trucks often stuck at the border. Limited aid shipments are described as an "invitation for killing," due to fears of mobbing, looting, and unrest. Palestinian health authorities report rising starvation-related deaths, emphasizing that current deliveries are far below what is needed.</p>

          <p>The UK's former scientific adviser, Lord Patrick Vallance, told the Covid inquiry that Boris Johnson pushed for a more "ruthless, authoritarian approach" towards people who refused to self-isolate during the pandemic. Vallance's diary entries revealed that policy makers favored "punitive measures" over financial support. Johnson reportedly said, "We haven't been ruthless enough. We need to force more isolation. I favour a more authoritarian approach." Ministers eventually introduced fines for those who failed to self-isolate, along with support payments for lower-income individuals.</p>

          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blames a crisis of chronic illness in children on ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use. The report calls American children "the sickest generation in American history" and criticizes corporate influence in federal policymaking. The report misrepresents existing scientific consensus and calls for further scientific inquiry "into the links between vaccines and chronic disease," despite numerous studies failing to find such a link. The report also assails “the overmedicalization of American children,” which it blames on pharmaceutical industry “capture” of the nation’s biomedical apparatus.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on the export of fentanyl and precursor chemicals caused a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25%. Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that absent China’s restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>Peru's top court has issued a landmark ruling recognizing the territorial rights of the Kichwa people within a protected area in the Amazon, marking a major breakthrough for Indigenous land claims. The decision affirms that Indigenous stewardship is fully compatible with conservation goals, setting a powerful precedent for rights-based forest protection in Peru. The ruling came after a legal challenge by four Indigenous organizations, who argued that the state denied their ancestral presence for decades, creating protected areas without consultation or consent.

The repeal deals a blow to California’s ambition of accelerating the transition to electric vehicles and will ripple across the country, as 11 other states intended to follow California’s plan and stop selling new gas-powered cars by 2035.</p>
