          <p>In San Diego, federal and local authorities apprehended three noncitizens for allegedly transporting nearly 8,000 pounds of methamphetamine, valued at over $5 million. The bust occurred during a narcotics investigation in the South Bay region, where officers observed the suspects loading vehicles with drug bundles. The three men, identified as Erick Omar Arriola, Eugenio Lizama, and Baltazar Rodriguez Reyes, face charges related to conspiracy, transportation, and possession of controlled substances. Authorities highlight this seizure as one of the largest methamphetamine busts in the Southern District of California this year and the optimism is low due to the large quantity of illegal substances being circulated into the population.</p>

The email, sent from an employee's account at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), confirms the breach, which M&S has not acknowledged. The incident is linked to the ongoing Co-op cyber-attack, raising concerns about the vulnerability of UK retailers to cyber threats and the need for robust security measures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's proclamation that banned foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. The judge cited "immediate and irreparable injury" to Harvard if the ban were to proceed. This legal challenge comes after Harvard filed a lawsuit against Trump's order, calling it illegal retaliation. The ruling allows international students to continue their work at the university, highlighting the importance of global collaboration in education.</p>

          <p>New research from PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact on jobs, finding that AI makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report indicates that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, with workers possessing AI skills earning significantly higher wages. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries adopting AI. The study suggests AI enriches jobs by freeing employees from tedious tasks, allowing them to develop more complex skills, which paints a positive picture of the future.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales collapse annually due to lost, damaged, or missing evidence. Over 30,000 prosecutions failed between 2020 and 2024, including serious violent and sexual offences. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) data indicates an increasing number of cases are dropped because police lack necessary evidence. Former officers attribute this to under-resourcing and the overwhelming amount of evidence they handle, which paints a bleak picture.</p>
