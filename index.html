This development comes amid ongoing efforts to locate and retrieve the remaining 20 bodies, with challenges posed by extensive destruction in Gaza. The peace plan initially stipulated the return of all 28 deceased hostages by October 13, a deadline Hamas failed to meet. The U.S. is reportedly sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to aid recovery, and Turkey has offered expert assistance.</p>

A lawsuit alleges a "sweeping betrayal of trust" by borrowers who surreptitiously subordinated Zions' first-priority interest and eliminated collateral. This scheme, involving related Cantor Group entities, enriched the borrowers at the bank's expense. The disclosure, prompted by a similar fraud suit against Cantor by Western Alliance, led Zions to provision for the loss, impacting its third-quarter earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will no longer use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following renewed scrutiny from the Jeffrey Epstein sexual assault scandal. This decision comes after excerpts from Virginia Roberts Giuffre's posthumous memoir detailed her alleged encounters with Andrew when she was 17. Andrew, who settled a lawsuit with Giuffre in 2022 while denying allegations, stated his decision prioritizes his family and country. The move marks a further withdrawal from public life, initiated after a widely criticized 2019 BBC interview.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett provides a master class on investment categories, particularly criticizing gold as a non-productive asset. He distinguishes between currency-denominated investments, which are bets on government behavior, and assets like gold that produce nothing and rely solely on speculative future demand. Buffett advocates for investing in productive assets, such as farms or businesses, whose value is derived from their ability to generate returns over time. His philosophy emphasizes focusing on intrinsic value and long-term delivery rather than short-term market fluctuations or speculative hopes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cities globally are undergoing a "traffic revolution," prioritizing cycling infrastructure to create cleaner and happier urban environments. New York, London, Montreal, and Copenhagen are expanding protected bike lanes, intersections, and traffic signal tweaks to enhance cyclist and pedestrian safety. This shift, exemplified by Brooklyn's Court Street lane removal for bikes, promotes sustainable transport, reduces carbon emissions, and improves air quality and noise pollution. Despite challenges like e-bike safety concerns, the movement aims to make cycling a low-stress, accessible choice, fostering healthier communities and reducing car-related fatalities.</p>

Issues like reproductive rights, healthcare, economic inequality, and the situation in Gaza are particularly urgent for them, viewing politics as self-defense.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is expected to confirm Douglas Troutman, a former industry lobbyist, to lead the EPA's chemical safety office, raising concerns among campaigners about public health and safety. With Troutman's confirmation, all top four positions in the toxics office will be held by ex-chemical industry lobbyists. Critics, like Scott Faber of the Environmental Working Group, fear this signals a reversal of progress on toxic chemical regulations and potential deregulation. Troutman's past actions, including an attempt to repeal a California chemical transparency law, fuel these anxieties about industry influence over environmental protection.</p>

Repair work has begun on power lines to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant after a four-week outage, crucial for nuclear safety.

Remarriage often brings economic benefits, with remarried individuals showing higher median household wealth compared to divorced working adults.
