          <p>Following protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement operations, the Trump administration deployed the California National Guard, leading to further clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address lawlessness in California, while Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and an escalation of tensions. The protests, which included demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway, stemmed from concerns over ICE operations in the area.

Murrow's battle against Senator Joseph McCarthy. Clooney co-wrote the original screenplay and the play, which explores themes of truth, intimidation, and courage in corporate media during the 1950s. The play recreates the CBS newsroom of the 1950s and highlights the importance of journalism in holding government accountable. Clooney sees parallels between the play's themes and contemporary issues facing the news media, emphasizing the need for journalists to stand up against pressure from the government and corporations. </p>

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, where they participated in ceremonies using psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT. The retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and find relief from their symptoms, as traditional treatments had often proven ineffective. While one veteran experienced a decline in mental health following the retreat, eight others reported improvements and called the experience life-changing. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, signaling a growing interest in the potential of psychedelic therapies. </p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have weakened Iran's influence in the Middle East, according to analysts. A Mossad operation involving explosive pagers and walkie-talkies decimated Hezbollah's leadership and military capabilities, leading to a ceasefire and a diminished role for the organization in Lebanon. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, further isolated Hezbollah and cut off its access to critical supply routes. Experts believe that Iran's proxy war strategy, which relied on Hezbollah to exert influence in the region, has suffered a significant setback. </p>

          <p>Britain's energy system faces challenges as renewable energy generation exceeds the grid's capacity, resulting in compensation payments to firms like Ocean Winds for turning down wind farm output. The current system, designed for coal and gas plants near cities, struggles to distribute renewable electricity generated in remote areas. The National Electricity System Operator warns that balancing the grid could cost almost Â£8 billion a year by 2030, potentially increasing energy bills. The government is considering regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower costs, but the proposal has sparked debate within the energy industry. </p>

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government quietly explored the possibility of transitioning India to a presidential system. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the proposal aimed to centralize executive power and sideline the judiciary. While the idea never fully materialized, it influenced constitutional amendments that expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. After Gandhi's defeat in 1977, the Janata Party reversed many of these changes, but the concept resurfaced in the 1980s, highlighting the ongoing debate about India's governance structure. </p>
