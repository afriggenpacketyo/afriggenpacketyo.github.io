          <h2>Astronomers Observe Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have directly observed the building blocks of rocky planets forming around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. This discovery provides an unprecedented glimpse into the dawn of planetary systems, suggesting that the processes which formed Earth may be common throughout the universe. The observations detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in a region analogous to our solar system's asteroid belt. This breakthrough helps scientists understand whether Earth-like worlds are a cosmic rarity or a frequent phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Days of severe torrential rain in South Korea have resulted in significant flooding and landslides, claiming the lives of at least 14 people, with another 12 reported missing. The disaster has caused widespread destruction, particularly in the country's central and southern regions, damaging thousands of buildings and roads and forcing nearly 10,000 residents to evacuate. In response, President Lee Jae-myung has ordered the hardest-hit areas to be declared special disaster zones. Rescue efforts are ongoing amid fears the death toll could rise further.</p>

          <p>The mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern fatally shot near the White House, is pleading for the arrest of his killers, warning that other families could face similar tragedies. Tarpinian-Jachym was an unintended victim in a shooting where several individuals fired into a group. The incident has highlighted rising homicide rates in the city, prompting the FBI to join the investigation alongside the Metropolitan Police Department. No suspects are currently in custody for the murder of the University of Massachusetts Amherst student.</p>

          <p>South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to counteract a growing trade deficit and mitigate the impact of a looming 30% U.S. tariff. A high-level South African delegation visited Beijing to promote a shift from exporting basic commodities to higher-value products like pharmaceuticals and green energy technologies. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the need to address market access barriers and establish a more balanced trade relationship with China. Observers note that while China is a crucial alternative market, it presents its own complexities and risks of over-dependence. (not investment advice)</p>

Pool Corp., a distributor of swimming pool supplies, is highlighted for its consistent revenue from maintenance and repairs, which creates a reliable income stream.

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, marking the first clear ministerial goal on the issue.

The plan also includes a ban on wet wipes containing plastic and aims to significantly cut phosphorus pollution from treated wastewater.

However, prosecutors argued it was a deliberate execution, pointing to the fact she shot him twice in the head.

Investigators then used DNA evidence and location data from the killer's Google Dashboard to identify and track George Steven Burch.

These stations provide essential local news, emergency information, and community connection in areas with limited internet and cell service.

          <p>A commentary by Simon Tisdall posits that the relentless conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, and elsewhere persist due to a global fracture in shared moral standards. The article suggests that the sheer scale of atrocities has become commonplace because a "curse of moral relativism" prevents universal agreement on what is indefensible. This collapse of a "permanent moral order" mirrors the breakdown of the international rules-based system, making peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. The author argues that without a return to shared ethical principles, defined by international law and social contracts, the cycle of violence will continue unabated.</p>

          <p>A tourist boat named Wonder Seas, carrying 53 people, capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay, resulting in at least 37 deaths. Most of the passengers were reportedly Vietnamese families, and the dead include at least eight children. Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain but have managed to pull 11 survivors from the water, including a boy who survived in an air pocket.

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu suffered a significant career setback after a seventh-round TKO loss to Sebastian Fundora in their world title rematch in Las Vegas. The defeat marks Tszyu's third loss in his last four fights, a stark contrast to his previously undefeated record. Despite showing immense courage, Tszyu struggled against the much taller Fundora, who dropped him in the first round and opened a severe cut above his eye. The loss leaves Tszyu's future in the super-welterweight division uncertain as he and his team contemplate their next steps.</p>

          <h2>United States to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Many Travelers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. The fee, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs and is set to begin with the 2025 fiscal year. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, many details about its implementation remain unclear. Experts and travel associations have raised questions about the collection and refund process, with some advising travelers to treat the fee as nonrefundable.</p>
