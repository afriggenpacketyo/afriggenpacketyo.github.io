          <p>Protests and counter-protests regarding the use of hotels to house migrants have led to fifteen arrests across England. Clashes occurred in London and Newcastle, while a large march took place in Manchester, involving groups like Britain First and Stand Up To Racism. The events come as the Home Secretary plans to fast-track asylum appeals to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels. The government aims to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029, a move it says will save £1 billion annually.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal prosecutions against President Donald Trump. The probe reportedly centers on potential violations of the Hatch Act, which limits political activities by government employees, following a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton. The OSC, an independent agency, cannot file criminal charges but can recommend disciplinary action. This development occurs in a context of increased scrutiny of former government officials under the Trump administration.</p>

Despite the cutthroat nature of the NFL's roster cuts, the two maintain a friendly rivalry, focusing on mutual improvement.

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to €3,248, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees and is straining the country's long-term care insurance system. Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform, as the system faces a potential collapse due to an aging population and rising costs. Experts attribute the price hike to necessary wage increases for historically underpaid nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels. With the system's financial shortfall projected to exceed €12 billion by 2029, solutions being discussed include tax subsidies and higher contributions from high-income earners.

          <p>The Tea app, which allows women to anonymously share information and run background checks on men in their dating pool, has experienced a significant data breach. Hackers accessed and leaked highly sensitive user data, including driver's licenses, private messages, and selfies, which were then posted on sites like 4chan. The breach threatens the safety and anonymity of the app's users and has sparked a debate about the risks of digital "whisper networks." The company faces two class-action lawsuits in response to the incident, which affected users who signed up before February 2024.</p>

          <p>Reigning 100-meter world champion sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was arrested for a fourth-degree domestic violence offense following an incident at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. According to a police report, Richardson allegedly assaulted her boyfriend, fellow sprinter Christian Coleman, during a disturbance. Camera footage reportedly showed Richardson grabbing Coleman's backpack and shoving him into a wall. Richardson was booked into jail and released the next day, and subsequently competed in the U.S. track and field championships, where she has an automatic bye to the world championships.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are getting their news from TikTok, relying on fast-paced content from "newsfluencers" and meme-style videos rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, drawn to its convenience and simplified explanations of complex events. Creators like Aaron Parnas have gained millions of followers by rapidly summarizing breaking news, while outlets like The Washington Post are experimenting with news skits. This trend raises questions about misinformation, as users often rely on crowdsourced comments for fact-checking.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's proclamation aimed at shutting down the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit panel ruled that the administration cannot use the order to bypass laws requiring the U.S. to consider claims from migrants facing persecution or torture if deported. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system, it affirmed that mandatory protections, like "withholding of removal," must still be processed. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by the ACLU challenging the legality of the president's sweeping border measures.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's order restricting "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like a person's race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, as such actions likely violate the Constitution's 4th Amendment protections. The case centered on sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that appeared to profile individuals. The ruling affirms that immigration officials must have reasonable suspicion that a specific individual is in the country illegally before detaining them.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton described his own driving as "useless" after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance to the final qualifying round. A downcast Hamilton took full responsibility, stating his performance had "nothing to do with the car." He did, however, congratulate Leclerc and the team, acknowledging the car's potential in his teammate's hands.</p>

The investigation found over 50 instances where people said their names were forged, including three individuals who are deceased, and others who claimed they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far more than the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to gather them.

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after hitting a record high on Monday. The downturn was fueled by a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions and significant downward revisions for previous months. This data, along with President Trump's implementation of new "reciprocal" tariffs and criticism of the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates, created significant market uncertainty. Major tech earnings from companies like Amazon and Apple also contributed to the volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The dominant performance, however, was marred by a red card for captain Marlie Packer in the second half for a clumsy clearout. The dismissal means Packer may miss some of England's opening matches at the upcoming Rugby World Cup, pending a disciplinary review. Despite the disciplinary issue, the Red Roses demonstrated their formidable power ahead of the tournament, with Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick.</p>
