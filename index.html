          <h2>UK Universities Face Scrutiny Over Student Mental Health Support Systems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:24:02 EDT</div>

          <p>Students in the UK report that university mental health services are inadequate, often described as "one-size-fits-all" and difficult to navigate. While universities have increased spending on wellbeing services, they stress they are not a substitute for the NHS, raising a debate about their level of responsibility. The article explores the rising mental health concerns among students, the challenges faced by academic tutors who are often the first point of contact, and the ongoing discussion about establishing a formal duty of care for higher education institutions. This comes after several high-profile student tragedies highlighted systemic gaps in support.</p>

          <p>In a move that challenges the traditional independence of the U.S. central bank, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve. This visit marks the first by a sitting president in nearly two decades and is seen as a direct escalation of his public criticism of Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has repeatedly condemned Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he might attempt to fire him. The visit is a highly symbolic act that underscores the administration's pressure on the Fed's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Soldiers from Thailand and Cambodia engaged in a firefight in a contested border area, marking a significant escalation in a long-standing territorial dispute. The clash occurred after both nations downgraded diplomatic ties, with Cambodia expelling the Thai ambassador in response to Thailand closing border crossings. The immediate trigger was a landmine explosion that injured five Thai soldiers, which Thailand blamed on Cambodia. This event is the latest in a series of violent confrontations over disputed land, particularly around ancient temples, fueled by nationalist sentiments in both countries.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by local "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) opposition, a growing number of states are passing laws to compel cities and counties to allow for more affordable and denser housing. Utah, for example, is requiring municipalities to adopt strategies to increase housing supply, as soaring home prices have made homeownership unattainable for a large portion of its population. The article highlights the tension between state mandates aimed at addressing a national housing crisis and local governments concerned about infrastructure strain and loss of control. This reflects a broader effort to tackle generational wealth gaps exacerbated by the housing shortage.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, provided an entertaining spectacle for fans but also highlighted a growing debate about its purpose. The absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who skipped the event, has intensified questions about the fixture's importance in a crowded global soccer calendar. While the game serves as a valuable business and marketing event for the league, Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged that its format may need re-evaluation.

          <p>A federal appeals court has dealt another blow to the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship, affirming a lower court's ruling that the president's executive order is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the proposed policy, which would deny citizenship to many individuals born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges that have blocked the order since it was signed.

          <p>A major study suggests that walking just 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable goal than the popular 10,000-step benchmark, can significantly reduce the risk of serious health problems. Research published in The Lancet Public Health analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found this step count was associated with a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and dementia. The findings challenge the 10,000-step target, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence. Researchers hope this more realistic goal will encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their health.</p>

An Australian federal court overturned a previous ruling that had dismissed the case, finding that the airline could potentially be held responsible.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This new policy upends a long-standing practice under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required that minors from non-contiguous countries be transferred to government-run shelters. Now, these teens will be asked if they want to self-deport; if they decline, they will still be sent to the shelter system.

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of scheduled water tests for harmful pollutants in England's rivers and lakes over the last three months due to significant staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that monitoring programs for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff, have been paused. The cancellations, which the EA attributes to "fluctuations in staffing capacity," have raised alarms among campaigners and former employees. They warn that the lack of routine testing makes it difficult to track pollution trends and identify emerging environmental problems, including in protected areas like the River Wye.</p>

          <p>An oceanographer at the Scripps Institute discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in the area. These pelagic snails are known for their vibrant purple shells and their ability to float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. Their appearance in Southern California is unusual and often coincides with warmer offshore waters moving toward the coast. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers suggest that continued warm water trends could lead to more frequent sightings of these tropical and subtropical creatures along the coast.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House representatives has introduced a resolution to stop a controversial federal plan to shoot nearly half a million barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the culling plan to protect the native northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted and is facing extinction. Proponents of the resolution, led by Rep. Troy Nehls, argue the plan is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money. However, some conservationists and scientists warn that halting the removal of the more aggressive barred owls will inevitably lead to the spotted owl's demise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies published in the British Medical Journal have raised serious concerns about the accuracy and reliability of widely available home health self-test kits. Researchers who analyzed 30 kits for conditions like bowel cancer and vitamin deficiencies found that many lacked crucial information on accuracy, interpretation, and next steps. Experts warn that misleading results could lead to false reassurance or place unnecessary pressure on the NHS. With the self-test market growing rapidly, the studies call for much greater regulation to ensure these products are safe and effective for consumers.</p>

          <p>Alijah Arenas, a star freshman for the USC men's basketball team, will be sidelined for at least six to eight months after sustaining a serious knee injury requiring surgery. An MRI revealed a meniscus tear and a bone bruise, dealing a major blow to the Trojans' upcoming season. Arenas, a highly touted five-star recruit and top draft prospect, had reclassified to graduate high school a year early to join USC. The injury's timing raises questions about his future with the team, as a best-case scenario would see him return only late in his freshman season.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has initiated a ballot measure to repeal the city's gross receipts tax, which is levied on a wide range of companies. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax, which generates over $800 million annually, would improve the city's "anti-job climate" and provide financial relief to struggling businesses. However, city officials have sounded the alarm, warning that the loss of revenue would punch a massive hole in the budget and force drastic cuts to essential services like police and fire departments. The move sets up a major battle between business interests and city governance over L.A.'s economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, narrowly avoiding a technical recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly of semiconductors and chemical products. However, analysts remain cautious about the future, as domestic consumption remains sluggish and the global trade outlook is uncertain due to the specter of U.S. tariffs. The data provides some relief but underscores the challenges facing the nation's export-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at accelerating U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, including one targeting what the administration calls "woke" AI. The order requires federal funding recipients to maintain politically neutral AI models, free from "ideological dogmas" like diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Other orders seek to expedite permitting for data center construction and promote the export of American AI technology. The move is part of a broader "AI action plan" to cement U.S. leadership and echoes long-standing conservative grievances about perceived liberal bias within the tech industry.</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized new trade agreements with Indonesia and the Philippines, which will see U.S. shipments to those countries face no duties while imports will be subject to a 19 percent tariff. Analysts suggest the move is an indirect strategy to counter China's economic influence by reshaping regional supply chains and securing access to critical resources like rare earth minerals. However, the article notes that Chinese firms are already a step ahead, having increasingly localized their production within Southeast Asian nations over the past five years. This reduces their reliance on the transshipment routes the new deals might affect. (not investment advice)</p>
