          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to advance a major Republican spending bill after a small group of conservative senators, who had previously opposed it, changed their votes. The holdouts claimed that negotiations with party leadership, which included promises for a future vote on a Medicaid-related amendment, made them more comfortable moving the legislation forward. Despite advancing the bill, some of the senators have not committed to supporting its final passage, and Democrats have initiated a lengthy procedural delay by requesting the entire 1,000-page bill be read aloud.</p>

          <p>With England international Marc Guehi entering the final year of his Crystal Palace contract, Liverpool has emerged as a strong contender for his signature. The potential transfer hinges on several factors, including Crystal Palace's valuation, which was previously as high as Â£65 million, and whether Liverpool sees the price as reasonable for a player who will be a free agent next year. Guehi's decision may also be influenced by his potential playing time at Liverpool, where he would compete with established center-backs, and how a move could impact his standing with the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill following the threat of a large-scale rebellion from over 120 Labour backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that concerns raised by his colleagues led to a stronger, revised plan that is now better positioned to pass. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year era for the country's flagship space vehicle. The liquid-fuel rocket, a joint development by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a cornerstone of Japan's space program. The H2A series is now being retired and replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket. The new model is designed to be more cost-effective, aiming to keep Japan competitive in the global space launch market.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News telephone poll reveals that 50.2% of Japanese voters hope Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition loses its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. The survey, conducted ahead of the July 20 election, showed that only 38.1% of respondents wish for the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, Komeito, to maintain control of the upper house. This sentiment suggests a significant political challenge for the current government as it heads into the crucial national election.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old teacher in Fort Worth, Texas, lost his entire life savings of $32,000 to a phishing scam. The scammers, impersonating representatives from Chase Bank, convinced him his account was compromised and tricked him into moving his funds to a supposedly secure account. When he reported the incident, the bank distinguished the event as a scam, where the account holder authorizes the transfer, rather than fraud, where access is illegal. As a result, the bank's protection policies did not cover the full loss, and the teacher is now sharing his story to warn others.</p>

Lotus, owned by Chinese firm Geely, has insisted it has no plans to close the Hethel factory, stating that it is exploring strategic options to enhance efficiency and global competitiveness.

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has strongly criticized the decision to host the Club World Cup in the United States after his team's match against Benfica was suspended for two hours due to thunderstorms. Calling the situation "a joke," Maresca questioned if the U.S. was the right place for the competition, noting it was the sixth game of the tournament to be disrupted by weather. The frequent stoppages and extreme heat have raised concerns about player safety and tournament logistics, especially with the 2026 World Cup also set to be co-hosted by the US.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart uranium enrichment for a potential bomb within a matter of months. His assessment contradicts claims that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes had completely obliterated Iran's nuclear facilities, suggesting the damage was severe but not total. Grossi emphasized that Iran still possesses the necessary industrial and technological capabilities. This comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the IAEA, refusing inspectors access to the damaged sites.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created confusion about the mission's effectiveness. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed the sites were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be temporary. Officials later appeared to shift the stated goal of the attack from total destruction to compelling a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. This evolving narrative has led to ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage and the ultimate strategic objectives of the strike.</p>

With the BLS relying more on estimation due to staffing shortages, there is concern that the adjustment may not fully reflect the true cost increases for seniors, potentially eroding their benefits' purchasing power.

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for modern California. The magnitude 6.8 quake revealed critical vulnerabilities in unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that persisted for decades and led to deaths in later temblors. While many cities eventually mandated retrofits, some still have not acted on known structural risks. The 1925 event also spurred Santa Barbara's architectural transformation into a uniform Spanish Colonial Revival style, a move that helped define the city's unique character.</p>
