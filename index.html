          <h2>Japan Considers Increased U.S. Soy and Corn Imports Amid Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 10:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating increasing its imports of U.S. soybeans and corn as part of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This move is intended to absorb excess supply resulting from decreased U.S. exports to China due to trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. By increasing imports, Japan hopes to secure exemptions from U.S. tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. Additionally, a major opposition party in Japan is aiming to cut taxes on food items for a year, responding to concerns about inflation and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs as a crucial parliamentary election approaches.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 10:29:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill in the UK could lead to life imprisonment for cyclists who cause fatal accidents through dangerous cycling. The current law, dating back to 1861, only allows for a maximum two-year sentence for cycling offenders, but the new changes would align cycling offenses with those for driving. Serious injury caused by careless or inconsiderate cycling could result in a two-year sentence, a fine, or both. This legislative change aims to ensure that cyclists who recklessly endanger others face appropriate legal consequences, reflecting the government's priority for road safety.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump insists that the bond market's reaction did not influence his decision to pause the implementation of aggressive "reciprocal" tariffs against U.S. trading partners. Despite market recoil and rising Treasury yields following the initial tariff announcement, Trump maintains that the pause was to allow time for negotiations. He stated that he would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. has levies as high as 50% still in place a year from now. Trump also said that he had spoken with many countries and that he did not even want them to come in.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a new carnivorous caterpillar on Oahu, Hawaii, nicknamed the "bone collector" due to its unique behavior of adorning its silk case with the body parts of its prey. This caterpillar feeds on insects trapped in spiderwebs and uses their remains for camouflage, potentially allowing it to feast on the spider's ensnared meals without being detected. The origins of this predatory caterpillar date back at least 6 million years. Researchers are urging conservation efforts to protect this unique lineage, which is found in a small, isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, poised to become Germany's next chancellor, struggles with low personal popularity despite his CDU's election victory. Polls indicate declining trust and leadership perception among Germans, partly attributed to his approach to the far-right AfD and U-turns on key policy decisions. Merz's perceived trustworthiness has been affected by instances such as breaking his word to pass a motion with AfD support and agreeing to debt brake reforms he previously opposed. He also faces challenges related to misogyny accusations and unpopularity in eastern Germany, hindering his efforts to shake off the AfD.</p>

Hegseth has denied sharing classified war plans over Signal, blaming former staffers for leaking information to "sabotage" Trump's agenda.

          <p>An individual expresses concern over RFK Jr's stance on autism, particularly his vow to find the cause of the "autism epidemic" and his description of it as a "preventable disease." The author, whose parents are neurodivergent, fears that RFK Jr's views stigmatize autistic individuals and threaten to undermine efforts to promote understanding and acceptance. The author argues that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide spectrum of symptoms and that RFK Jr's blanket description fails to account for the diversity of experiences within the autistic community. The author contends that the focus should be on support and understanding, not categorization and prevention.</p>

          <p>Demand for private jets is declining as potential buyers are spooked by tariffs and economic uncertainty. Customer interest in purchasing business jets has fallen significantly, with a substantial drop recorded in Barclays' latest survey of business jet broker-dealers and financiers. Survey respondents indicated that clients are putting purchases on hold due to fears about the impact of tariffs on the aircraft market and their operating businesses. The decline in demand correlates with airplane manufacturers' book-to-bill ratio, indicating a slowdown in the market.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, could face the death penalty despite his autism diagnosis. The defense argued that Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder reduces his culpability and that executing someone with autism would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. However, the judge agreed with prosecutors that only an intellectual disability precludes the death penalty and that Kohberger's diagnosis was of mild autism without intellectual impairment. The judge also ruled on the admissibility of evidence, including the 911 call and text messages from surviving roommates.</p>
