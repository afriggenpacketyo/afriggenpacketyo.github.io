          <p>As President Trump engages in talks in Saudi Arabia, China's increasing economic and political involvement in the Middle East is becoming a focal point, with new trade and investment agreements expected to be the primary focus. Washington is aiming to counter China's expanding economic presence, particularly regarding the internationalization of the yuan, with analysts suggesting that China's leverage could help stabilize the region, specifically in relation to Iran. One potential point of contention is the use of the yuan in Gulf trade and China's currency swap agreements, which Washington may pressure Gulf countries to reduce.</p>

          <p>Nissan is set to reduce its global workforce by an additional 11,000 jobs and close seven factories due to weak sales and financial losses, with falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the U.S. contributing to the company's struggles. This follows a previous announcement of 9,000 job cuts, bringing the total layoffs to approximately 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. The company reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, further impacted by U.S. tariffs, and has ceased talks of a merger with Honda, citing disagreements, with Nissan's CEO describing the previous financial year as challenging, citing rising costs and an uncertain environment.</p>

          <p>Despite Austria's federal government deprioritizing climate action, Vienna is taking significant steps to combat climate change, including mandating solar panels on new buildings, utilizing geothermal energy to heat homes, and investing in infrastructure to adapt to extreme weather. The city recently passed a climate law aiming to achieve zero climate pollution by 2040, emphasizing accountability by requiring projects to detail both financial and emissions costs. Vienna's commitment provides a model for cities globally, though some of its actions may not be directly replicable in all contexts, such as the U.S., due to differences in utility ownership.</p>

          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was convicted of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021 and received an 18-month suspended sentence, with the actor denying the charges and his lawyer stating he would appeal the verdict. The women accused Depardieu of groping them during filming, prompting a trial where the actor claimed he was not the man described by the accusers. The trial sparked protests against sexism and impunity for sex offenders in the French film industry, and the article notes that Depardieu has faced numerous other accusations of sexual misconduct, though many are beyond the statute of limitations.</p>

Trump has since eased tariffs, including a temporary reduction on Chinese goods, which is expected to lessen the impact on household costs, although a range of levies remain in place.

          <p>Following high-level trade talks between China and the United States, the U.S. delegation praised the negotiating style of their Chinese counterparts, noting a rare sense of "equanimity" and mutual respect, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent describing Vice-Premier He Lifeng as a very skilled negotiator. These talks stood in contrast to previous negotiations led by former vice-premier Liu He, which were often tense, volatile, and marked by distrust, and during the recent meeting, Chinese Vice-Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang made his debut as a trade representative.</p>

          <h2>Texas Farmers Grapple with Water Scarcity Amidst U.S.-Mexico Treaty Disputes</h2>

          <p>Texas farmers are facing challenges due to a prolonged drought and disputes over water deliveries from Mexico under an 80-year-old treaty, with Mexico historically behind on its water obligations, resulting in significant financial losses for Texas farms. President Trump has pressured Mexico to deliver water, even denying a request from Mexico for water, but experts suggest that the water scarcity makes it difficult for Mexico to meet its treaty obligations. Despite recent agreements, concerns remain about the long-term water supply, potentially impacting the region's agricultural industry and the state's economy.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.'s temporary reduction of tariffs on China, businesses are scrambling to expedite shipments, with the lower import taxes set to last for only 90 days, creating uncertainty for importers. The tax on Chinese imports to the U.S. will decrease from 145% to 30%, while China's tariff on U.S. goods will drop from 125% to 10%, although some businesses may rush to produce and ship goods early for the holiday season to avoid potential higher tariffs later. Despite the disruption, many business owners view the temporary deal as better than the previous situation, and are exploring alternative manufacturing locations outside of China.</p>

The key challenge is reaching $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to offset the cost of extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, with Republicans planning to increase the debt ceiling for five years as part of the package. Contentious issues include Medicaid reforms, extending tax cuts, addressing the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, and shifting costs of federal food assistance to the states, with some Republicans cautioning against benefit cuts.</p>

          <p>Fintech firms, which initially benefited from interest rate hikes, now face a resilience test as interest rates decline, with higher rates boosting net interest income for companies like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo in 2024. As interest rates fall, doubts arise about the sustainability of relying on this income, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in fintech business models, and some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce reliance on card fees and interest. Companies like Revolut are adding services such as crypto and share trading, and income diversification is seen as key to weathering economic changes.</p>
