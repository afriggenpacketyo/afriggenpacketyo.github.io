          <p>Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a London demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed by the government under terrorism laws. Protesters deliberately defied the ban, which makes support for the group a criminal offense, by holding signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action." The mass arrests have sparked a debate over free speech, with human rights groups like Amnesty International calling the police response disproportionate, while government officials defended the ban as necessary for national security.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly due to a clash with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS cross-check a list of 40,000 names, but the agency cited taxpayer privacy laws in its refusal to share the information it found. This conflict highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to aid in its immigration crackdown, while raising significant concerns about the privacy and rights of taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Neurologists are cautioning against the consumption of three specific types of food due to potential harm to the nervous system. These include damaged or bulging canned foods, which may contain the botulinum toxin, large tropical reef fish like barracuda that can carry ciguatoxin, and undercooked pork, which poses a risk of neurocysticercosis from tapeworm eggs. These pathogens and toxins can cause severe neurological symptoms, including paralysis and seizures, and experts advise caution, especially with home-canned products and food from unregulated sources.</p>

Despite Bairstow's late-game heroics, Fire's top-order collapse proved too much to overcome. In another match, the Oval Invincibles secured a dominant nine-wicket victory over Manchester Originals, thanks to a powerful opening partnership between Will Jacks and Tawanda Muyeye, who both scored impressive half-centuries.</p>

He emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that the country will not give up land to the occupier. The statement comes as the White House plans for the high-stakes meeting in Alaska, which has raised concerns among allies that Kyiv's interests could be marginalized.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is meeting with Qatar's prime minister to discuss a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza.

This diplomatic push occurs amid widespread international condemnation of Israel's announced plan to launch a large-scale military takeover of Gaza City, a move many fear will worsen the humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>An anti-immigration protest drew hundreds of participants to Nuneaton, part of a series of similar demonstrations across England. The protest was organized after a local council leader alleged that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers, a claim that remains unverified. The event, which included a march through the town center, highlights rising social tensions related to immigration, crime, and official transparency, with police making one arrest during the demonstration.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers who were inspecting the site. The soldiers were tasked with dismantling the depot's contents as part of a UN-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel. The incident occurs at a time of high tension, as the Lebanese government is actively pursuing a plan to disarm Hezbollah, a powerful Iran-backed group that strongly opposes the measure and holds significant political influence.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is confronting a severe environmental crisis, with fishermen from Libya to Egypt reporting devastating impacts on their livelihoods. Key issues include massive plastic pollution, the depletion of fish stocks by industrial trawlers, and coastal degradation from sewage and development. This article details these shared challenges, which threaten marine biodiversity and local economies, while also examining the various national and international initiatives proposed to address the growing problems, which many locals feel are insufficient.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of modern partisan gerrymandering, tracing its significant impact on U.S. politics back to the Republican "Redmap" project of 2010. It explains how technologically advanced map-drawing has allowed parties, particularly the GOP, to create non-competitive districts, entrenching their power in Congress and state legislatures regardless of the popular vote. The piece also covers the role of court rulings, grassroots reform efforts, and the current potential for a new mid-decade redistricting battle.</p>

          <p>In a bizarre diplomatic event, Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a Soviet-era award to U.S. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for the family of a senior CIA official. The award posthumously honored the official's son, Michael Gloss, who was killed last year while fighting with Russian forces in Ukraine. This unusual gesture comes as a high-stakes summit between Trump and Putin is confirmed, adding a strange and grim element to the already complex U.S.-Russia relationship.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has detailed a proposed settlement for survivors of clergy abuse that uses a point-based system to determine compensation. Court documents show points will be assigned based on the severity of the abuse, with acts like sexual assault valued highest, but the final monetary worth of each point is still uncertain. With a total fund of up to $235 million, the plan faces opposition from some survivors' attorneys who are urging a 'no' vote in favor of pursuing larger individual lawsuits.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been subpoenaed by the U.S. Justice Department to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. James's office, which successfully sued the Trump Organization for fraudulently overvaluing assets, has condemned the move as a blatant act of political retribution and an abuse of power. This development signals a significant escalation in the political conflict between the Trump administration and state-level officials who have investigated him.</p>
