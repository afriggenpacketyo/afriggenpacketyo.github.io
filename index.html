          <p>New York Yankees superstar Aaron Judge was unexpectedly removed from the lineup for a recent game due to an "elbow issue." Manager Aaron Boone confirmed that Judge experienced discomfort while throwing from the outfield in the previous game, which prompted the team to order an MRI. The team is currently awaiting the results, raising concerns about the health of the reigning American League MVP, especially as the Yankees have been struggling in recent games. This development adds a significant layer of uncertainty to the team's immediate future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A small but growing movement of young Israelis is choosing to face imprisonment rather than serve their mandatory military conscription in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Citing moral objections to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, these "refusers" endure jail time, lose friendships, and experience family tensions, often being labeled as traitors within mainstream society. The article profiles individuals like 19-year-old Itamar Greenberg, who spent six months in a military prison for his stance. Despite the personal costs, they continue their activism, hoping to inspire change from within a society deeply entrenched in its military identity.</p>

This initiative aligns with President Trump's campaign promise for an aggressive reduction in government oversight, which he claims drives up costs.

          <p>A panel of political journalists analyzed why President Trump is struggling to deflect the controversy surrounding his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. They argue the issue strikes at the core of his populist appeal, which often targets a "powerful elite." By now appearing to defend powerful figures and withhold information, Trump risks alienating his MAGA base, which is uncharacteristically showing discontent over his handling of the files. This dynamic makes the Epstein case a particularly potent and persistent political problem for the president, unlike other scandals he has successfully weathered in the past.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being hailed by critics as a potential "song of the summer," reflecting a national mood that is more subdued and melancholic. The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a gauzy, R&B-influenced style that is both soothing and complex. The lead single "Daisies" exemplifies this approach with its muffled production and gentle lyrics, capturing a desire for stability over excitement. This analysis suggests that the album's downtempo yet emotionally resonant sound is connecting with listeners in a way that more upbeat tracks have not this season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. global AIDS program, PEPFAR, recently avoided a $400 million funding cut after the Senate rejected the Trump administration's rescission proposal. While advocates for the program are relieved, its long-term future remains uncertain, as many of its services were disrupted by the administration's halt on foreign aid. The program's congressional authorization has expired, and there are concerns about its ability to function effectively without its full range of prevention and care initiatives. This has left global health experts feeling that while a major crisis was averted, the program is not yet on stable ground.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered to combat diseases like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. These "Wolbitos" are infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia, which prevents them from transmitting the viruses to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to scale up the project nationwide. This innovative, self-sustaining approach offers a powerful new tool in the fight against devastating mosquito-borne illnesses that affect millions annually.</p>
