          <h2>European Powers Urge End to Gaza's Humanitarian Crisis Amid Diplomatic Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:58:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leaders from Germany, the UK, and France have jointly called for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza, labeling the situation a "humanitarian catastrophe." This coordinated statement follows French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that France will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, a move that highlights differing approaches among European allies. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Israel may soon permit foreign aid airdrops to resume over the besieged enclave as ceasefire negotiations are potentially set to restart next week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than a third of the United Kingdom's Members of Parliament, totaling 220 from nine different parties, have signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter argues that recognition would be a vital step toward a two-state solution and send a powerful message of support for Palestinian rights. The move increases pressure on the UK government, especially after France recently announced its own plans for recognition. Prime Minister Starmer has stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical plan for peace in the region.</p>

          <p>An Arizona judge sentenced Lori Vallow Daybell to two consecutive life sentences for conspiring to murder her fourth husband and her niece's ex-husband in 2019. This sentencing follows her previous conviction in Idaho, where she is already serving life without parole for murdering her two youngest children. Prosecutors argued her motives were financial gain and a desire to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. During the hearing, emotional victim impact statements were delivered by family members, who described her actions as a wake of destruction.</p>

          <p>The new Marvel film, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," is positioned as a vibrant relaunch for the characters but struggles to find a sense of fun, according to this article's review. While praised for its handsome retro-futuristic visuals and capable ensemble cast, the movie reportedly rushes past the team's family dynamics to focus on a world-ending threat from the villain Galactus. This leaves little room for the character-driven banter and chemistry that define the source material. The performances are described as muted, and the film's relentless focus on crisis overshadows the potential for playful adventure.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers began his first training camp with the Pittsburgh Steelers by throwing an interception on his first pass in team drills. The 41-year-old quarterback, who recently joined the team after a brief and injury-plagued tenure with the New York Jets, downplayed the incident with a smile. He told reporters that he's known for trying out difficult throws in practice and remains stellar at protecting the football during games. Rodgers expressed confidence in the team's potential, suggesting they are one of about 10 to 12 teams with a legitimate chance at a Super Bowl.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, particularly those at certain income levels, using revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. The federal government has collected approximately $100 billion from these tariffs, which Mr. Trump suggested could be used for rebates or to pay down the national debt. This proposal echoes previous direct payment programs, such as those during the pandemic, and would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue the checks.

GloRilla stated that instead of focusing on the burglars, police focused on her, and her attorneys have criticized law enforcement's priorities, asserting that their client is a victim, not a suspect.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the early conflict between Adolf Hitler and Hans Luther, the president of Germany's central bank, the Reichsbank, in 1933. As a fiscally conservative and independent figure, Luther resisted Hitler's initial attempts to assert political control over the bank and fund a massive rearmament program. Despite legal protections that made the bank president immune to dismissal by the government, Hitler ultimately forced Luther's resignation through intimidation and extralegal threats. The events illustrate how the Nazi regime dismantled institutional checks and balances to finance its agenda.</p>

This article explains that closing on a HELOC typically takes two to six weeks due to necessary steps like income verification, credit checks, and property appraisals. However, closing in under two weeks may be possible with certain online lenders, by having all financial documents prepared in advance, or if the lender waives a full appraisal.

The problem typically isn't the Wi-Fi router on the plane but the connection to the internet, which comes from either ground-based towers or satellites. While newer satellite technology offers a much better experience, many aircraft, particularly smaller regional jets, still use the older, less reliable air-to-ground systems. Airlines are in the process of upgrading their entire fleets, but the transition is slow, meaning consistent, reliable internet for all passengers is likely still a few years away.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a student housing complex on the University of New Mexico's Albuquerque campus has left one person dead and another injured. The incident occurred in the early morning hours at the Casas del Rio dormitory, and police say the suspect remains at large. In response, the university has closed its central campus and asked students to shelter in place while multiple law enforcement agencies conduct a search. The shooting reportedly took place during new student orientation, a time that a local official noted should be filled with hope and excitement.</p>

          <p>This article explains the formal process and stringent criteria required for declaring a famine, providing context for the current hunger crisis in Gaza. The world relies on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a five-phase scale used by aid groups and the UN. A "famine" (Phase 5) is only declared when at least 20% of households face catastrophic food shortages, 30% of children are acutely malnourished, and the daily death rate from non-trauma causes exceeds two per 10,000 adults. Because data collection in conflict zones is difficult, people are often already dying of starvation long before this high technical bar is met.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the possibility of reaching a new trade agreement with Canada, suggesting a tariff-based approach might be the outcome instead of a negotiated deal. His remarks come as an August 1 deadline approaches for several countries to finalize new trade terms with the U.S. Canadian officials have maintained they will not be rushed into a "bad deal." The U.S. has already imposed tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and vehicles, disrupting the deeply integrated economies of the two nations and creating uncertainty for global trade.

          <p>Officials in the German state of Brandenburg are working to bring back a Yazidi family that was recently deported to Iraq, an action that may have violated a court order. The family, including four children, was put on a charter flight to Baghdad on the same day a court had lifted their obligation to leave Germany. The case is highly contentious because Germany's parliament has officially recognized the "Islamic State" group's 2014 atrocities against the Yazidi religious minority as a genocide. Advocacy groups have expressed concern, noting other Yazidi families now fear forced return to a region still recovering from the genocide.</p>

          <p>This advice column from NPR's Life Kit tackles two reader questions about navigating difficult personal interactions. The first addresses how to handle a friend whose negative self-talk about her body is causing anxiety, with experts suggesting a direct but supportive conversation or creating distance. The second question concerns a brother-in-law who makes cruel jokes about eating disorders. The experts advise confronting the bully directly and making it clear the behavior is unacceptable, while also supporting the children who are understandably upset by the comments.</p>

          <p>A new study has classified five U.S. metropolitan areas as "impossibly unaffordable" for homebuyers, placing them in the top ten least affordable markets globally. The report, which compares median home prices to median incomes, names San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Honolulu as having severe affordability challenges. Hong Kong was ranked the least affordable city in the world. The study suggests that policies limiting urban sprawl are a major contributor to high prices, making it increasingly difficult for middle and working-class families to purchase a home.

          <p>This article analyzes an emerging political conflict over congressional redistricting, as Republicans in states like Texas consider redrawing maps mid-decade to gain an advantage in the 2026 elections. This move, reportedly encouraged by President Trump, is a departure from the usual decennial process and is forcing Democrats to contemplate retaliatory measures in states they control. However, Democrats face significant hurdles, including independent redistricting commissions in key states and a lack of political will to bend established norms. The situation highlights a growing partisan battle over electoral competition.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England has begun, leading to the cancellation of scheduled medical procedures and sparking frustration among patients. The strike stems from a pay dispute between the doctors' union and the government. Patients interviewed by the BBC expressed fears that delays to their surgeries, including for conditions like kidney cancer, could worsen their health, with one describing the delay as a potential "death sentence." While the Health Secretary insists disruption will be minimal, previous walkouts have resulted in over a million canceled appointments.</p>

Officer Phillip Wagner was fatally shot while parked in his car, an incident that also wounded two other officers. According to a CBS News analysis, at least 50 officers have been shot in ambushes so far this year, on pace to surpass last year's total. The FBI is studying this trend and providing training to local law enforcement to increase situational awareness.</p>
