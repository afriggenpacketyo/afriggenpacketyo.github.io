          <h2>Trump Claims Iran-Israel Ceasefire Amid Republican Praise, Democratic Skepticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, sparking immediate praise from Republican lawmakers who lauded his negotiating skills and foreign policy expertise, some even suggesting him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Democrats, however, have been largely silent, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raising concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the President's actions, particularly the unilateral engagement in military actions without congressional approval. Vice President J.D. Vance described the '12-day war' as an important reset for the region, while Rep. Thomas Massie stated he would not push for a resolution requiring congressional approval for attacks on Iran given the ceasefire. This divergence in reactions underscores the deep political divisions surrounding the administration's foreign policy decisions, especially in the Middle East.</p>

The two iron ore pits are expected to produce a combined 31 million metric tons annually, with ore transported to Hope Downs 1 for processing. First iron ore from the project is anticipated in 2027, and Rio Tinto plans to invest over $13 billion in new mines, plant, and equipment in the next three years.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, potentially including conflict zones. This decision pauses a lower court ruling that had required immigrants to have a meaningful opportunity to claim potential torture, persecution, or death if deported to certain countries. The ruling was announced as Donald Trump declared a 'Complete and Total CEASEFIRE' between Israel and Iran, referring to the conflict as 'THE 12 DAY WAR.' These events highlight the administration's stance on immigration and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures to the eastern United States, impacting over 150 million Americans under extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous conditions from the Midwest to the East Coast, citing light winds, sunny skies, and inadequate overnight cooling. The heat wave is attributed to a heat dome, trapping heat and humidity, with meteorologists noting that the first heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous. Residents are advised to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and remain hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses, as climate change is contributing to more frequent and longer-lasting extreme temperatures.</p>

Officials are investigating whether these were cases of needle spiking with drugs like Rohypnol or GHB, often used in sexual assaults.

          <p>China's dominance in rare earth elements is significantly strengthened by supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. These imports are particularly high in heavy rare earth elements, which are less abundant and crucial for high-tech manufacturing. This reliance on Myanmar has effectively given Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain. While China has increased controls on rare earth exports, it has outsourced much of its extraction to Myanmar, raising concerns about environmental and human rights abuses in the region.</p>

This action is part of a broader conflict between the administration and Harvard, involving research grant cuts and threats to the school's tax-exempt status. Harvard sued the Department of Homeland Security, alleging the administration's actions were retaliation for the university's rejection of demands to overhaul policies related to campus protests and other issues.</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Senate passed a $2.46 billion hurricane relief package, approving a bill that had been stalled for a month but with significant changes. The Senate's version removes a $60 million grant program for small businesses, citing the state's 'emoluments clause' as a constitutional issue. Senate Republicans argue that providing grants to specific businesses violates the constitution, while Democrats express concerns about the changes and their potential impact on western North Carolina's recovery. The bill now returns to the House, which must agree to the changes before it can be sent to the Governor.</p>

          <p>Children with speech and language difficulties are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems, according to a report by Speech and Language UK. The charity notes that nearly half of young people referred to mental health services also face significant speech and language challenges. They advocate for better training for teachers, school staff, and mental health professionals to identify and support children with these issues. The government has committed to providing mental health support in every secondary school in England by 2030, highlighting the need for specialized training in spotting speech and language issues.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of UK veterans are taking legal action against 3M, alleging they were issued defective earplugs during their service, leading to hearing loss. The claim asserts that the Combat Arms Earplugs, supplied to the Ministry of Defence between 2003 and 2023, had a design flaw that prevented a complete seal in the ear. 3M, which acquired the original manufacturer Aearo Technologies, is accused of knowing about the defect. The lawsuit follows a $6 billion settlement made by 3M in the US regarding the same earplugs, though the company admitted no liability.</p>

          <p>Proposed federal funding cuts to NPR could silence one of the few news sources left for rural Louisiana, potentially impacting access to vital information during emergencies like hurricanes. Red River Radio, a public radio station in Shreveport, serves East Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, providing news to communities with limited access to other news organizations. The station's news director emphasizes the importance of public radio as a lifeline for residents who cannot afford satellite TV or internet access. Supporters argue that cutting funding would disproportionately affect rural broadcasters who struggle to raise private funds, dismantling a trusted source of information for millions.</p>

The analyst argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own oil exports, making it an unlikely scenario unless the situation escalates significantly. The market appears to agree, as oil prices dropped following reports of Iran's parliament approving the closure. The analyst also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a reliable energy supplier. (not investment advice)</p>
