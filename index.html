          <p>A terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur has left two people dead and three others seriously injured. The suspect, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram into people before launching a stabbing attack and was subsequently shot dead by police. One of the deceased victims, Adrian Daulby, was tragically killed by police gunfire as officers engaged the attacker. The incident is being investigated as terrorism, with authorities highlighting the bravery of worshippers who prevented the attacker from entering the building.</p>

          <p>Amazon is continuing to adjust its physical retail footprint by closing four of its Amazon Fresh grocery stores in Southern California. This move follows similar closures in the U.S. and a larger-scale shutdown in the U.K., signaling a strategic pivot towards its Whole Foods brand and online delivery services. The company stated that it regularly evaluates its store portfolio and will work with affected employees to find new roles within Amazon. This decision reflects the ongoing challenges and strategic realignments within Amazon's turbulent grocery business.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The court froze a lower court's decision that had blocked the termination, effectively allowing the administration to roll back protections that have shielded these individuals from deportation. This ruling removes the immediate legal obstacles preventing the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented from the court's unsigned order.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a statement indicating its agreement with key parts of a U.S.-proposed peace plan, including the release of Israeli hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to an independent body. However, the group also stated that it seeks changes and further discussion on other elements of the proposal, notably stopping short of agreeing to its own disarmament. The plan, backed by the U.S., calls for an immediate ceasefire and a significant exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. This conditional acceptance represents a potential, albeit fragile, step toward ending the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>Ronald Exantus, the man responsible for the 2015 stabbing death of six-year-old Logan Tipton in Versailles, Kentucky, has been released on parole. Exantus, who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity but was convicted of second-degree assault, served less than half of his 20-year sentence before being released for good behavior. The victim's father, Dean Tipton, has publicly expressed his profound anger and grief over the early release. The decision has sparked outrage and renewed debate about sentencing and parole for violent offenders.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, a critical distinction in pay protection has emerged: while federal employees are legally guaranteed to receive back pay, government contractors are not. This lack of protection affects millions of private-sector workers whose jobs depend on federal contracts, creating significant financial instability and uncertainty. Experts highlight that this can lead to severe cash-flow problems for contracting companies, particularly small businesses, and disrupts the livelihoods of workers who perform essential services for the government.

          <p>Residents of Portland, Oregon, are actively pushing back against President Trump's portrayal of their city as a violent, chaotic "war zone." Using social media, they are showcasing images of the city's peaceful daily life, including its natural beauty, thriving food scene, and bustling bookstores. While small protests have occurred at a federal ICE facility, locals and business owners argue that these have been largely peaceful and that Trump's claims are a gross exaggeration. They contend the president's rhetoric is a false depiction intended to score political points.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the release of Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," the estate of George Michael has given its enthusiastic approval for her interpolation of his 1987 hit "Father Figure." In a public statement, the estate said it had "no hesitation in agreeing to this association between two great artists." Swift's new song reportedly uses elements of the classic track to explore the complex dynamics of a mentor-protégé relationship. The endorsement highlights a moment of mutual respect between the legacies of two major pop icons.</p>

          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy has received formal apologies from PGA of America executives following incidents of verbal abuse and inappropriate behavior from fans during the Ryder Cup. Throughout the event, McIlroy was targeted with profane chants, and at one point a beer cup thrown from the crowd struck his wife's hat. McIlroy publicly condemned the behavior as unacceptable and called for golf to maintain a higher standard. The apologies from the sport's leadership acknowledge that some fan conduct clearly crossed a line and was disrespectful.</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown has forced the postponement of the much-anticipated monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This delay deprives economists, financial markets, and policymakers of a critical tool for assessing the health of the economy. The absence of this data creates significant uncertainty, particularly during what many see as a period of economic transition. If the shutdown persists, it could also delay other vital economic indicators, including the upcoming report on inflation, further obscuring the nation's economic picture.</p>

The app allowed users to crowdsource and share the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The developer attributed the decision to pressure from the Trump administration, while federal officials argued that such apps endanger law enforcement officers by potentially helping criminals ambush them.</p>

The scheme was reportedly caught on security cameras at both the Pala Casino and Harrah's Casino.

          <p>A successful conservation program that has boosted mountain gorilla populations in Central Africa has created an unforeseen problem: overcrowding. As gorilla families grow, their limited habitats are leading to more frequent and violent territorial disputes between groups. A tragic consequence of these conflicts is an increase in infanticide, where victorious males kill the young of the rival family. This phenomenon now poses a new threat to the long-term survival of the species, forcing conservationists to address the challenge of managing a growing population in a finite space.</p>

          <p>The booming market for vinyl records has been spared from new import tariffs due to a Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment. This legislation exempts "informational materials," including physical music, books, and artwork, from presidential trade regulations. The exemption is a significant relief for music labels, retailers, and consumers, as the Trump administration's recent rollback of tariff protections for low-value goods could have otherwise led to a sharp increase in the price of records, which are largely manufactured overseas.
