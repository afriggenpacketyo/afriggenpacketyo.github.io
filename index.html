        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three key strategies for Americans to maximize their Social Security retirement benefits. It emphasizes delaying claims past full retirement age for an 8% annual increase, working longer to boost earnings records over 35 years, and coordinating spousal benefits strategically for married couples. The piece also suggests supplementary income options like annuities, reverse mortgages, and maintaining a retirement portfolio to cover rising costs and ensure financial stability in later years. Implementing these steps early can significantly enhance future financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell, and the Fed's Board of Governors to block her termination. Trump announced Cook's firing, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, following months of criticism over the Fed's interest rate policies. Cook's legal team argues that Fed board members can only be removed "for cause," a standard they contend is not met by unsubstantiated allegations or policy disagreements, setting the stage for a significant legal challenge concerning the central bank's independence. The lawsuit seeks to confirm her status and safeguard the Fed's mandated autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a $40,000 money market account amidst falling interest rates. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates in some short-term scenarios, their variable rates are subject to change with Federal Reserve cuts. CDs, conversely, provide guaranteed fixed returns over their term, making them a more secure option for savers prioritizing predictable earnings. The analysis provides specific examples over 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, highlighting the trade-offs between flexibility and guaranteed income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian tennis player Daniil Medvedev received a hefty fine of $42,500 by the U.S. Open for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse following his first-round defeat. The outburst stemmed from a heated disagreement with the chair umpire over allowing his opponent, Benjamin Bonzi, an additional first serve after a photographer's disturbance. Medvedev, a former world No. 1 and 2021 U.S. Open champion, is known for his on-court antics and has a history of engaging with crowds. Despite his protest, he ultimately lost the match in five sets.

          <p>Nike is implementing another round of corporate layoffs, impacting less than 1% of its staff, as CEO Elliott Hill continues efforts to refocus the business. These cuts are part of a broader restructuring aimed at re-centering the company on sport and culture, a shift from the previous strategy that segmented the business by gender and age. Employees in the U.S. and Canada will learn their fate by September 8, with new roles taking effect on September 21. This move follows earlier layoffs and is intended to reignite innovation and sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's attempt to update its logo to a sleeker, more contemporary look sparked significant backlash, particularly from the political right, including figures like Donald Trump Jr. The restaurant chain, known for its old-timey aesthetic and Southern comfort food, faced criticism for abandoning its traditional imagery, including 'Uncle Herschel.' This incident is seen as a proxy for a larger culture war over American identity and nostalgia. The company initially defended the change but later acquiesced to public pressure, deciding to keep the old logo, causing its shares to rise. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes after US President Donald Trump previously criticized high drug costs in the US compared to other countries. The deal does not affect the NHS, which has its own negotiated rate, but will impact the estimated 1.5 million private users in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim reportedly retains the full support of the club's ownership, despite a shock Carabao Cup defeat to League Two Grimsby. Amorim's own post-match comments had raised questions about his future, but sources indicate the club views his tenure as a long-term project and is committed to avoiding short-term decisions based on poor results. United backed Amorim with a £200 million transfer budget this summer and continues negotiations for player departures. The club is preparing for upcoming Premier League and derby matches, with Amorim expected to clarify his statements to the media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of detainees at the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades has dropped by half, following a federal judge's order to wind down much of its operations. Border tsar Tom Homan confirmed the reduction, though he disagreed with the judge's decision, defending the facility's conditions. Internal emails suggest the center could be empty within days, marking a blow to the Trump administration's mass deportation drive. While this facility closes, other temporary detention centers are being built in Republican-led states, and Homan emphasized the need for more permanent infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

These solar-powered robots mimic real rabbits with heat, scent, and movement, monitored by cameras that alert contractors when a python is nearby. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of detecting the well-camouflaged snakes, which have decimated native species in the Everglades. While still in its infancy, officials are optimistic about the project's potential to control the rapidly growing python population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The future of flood preparedness in the U.S. is becoming increasingly uncertain as the Trump administration proposes budget freezes and staffing cuts for NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This reduction in scientific capacity, including potential disbandment of research arms and delays in crucial data projects like Atlas 15, comes as extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. Experts warn that hobbling NOAA limits the nation's ability to forecast and prepare for disasters, leaving communities more vulnerable to floods. (not investment advice)</p>
