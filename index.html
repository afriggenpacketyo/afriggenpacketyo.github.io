          <h2>MLB Commissioner to Propose Automated Strike Zone Amid Potential Lockout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 21:59:02 EDT</div>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred plans to propose an automated balls and strikes (ABS) system for the 2026 season, aiming to refine the process based on spring training trials. The system, which allows batters, pitchers, or catchers to challenge calls, aims to improve accuracy, though Manfred acknowledges the need for player acceptance. This significant change comes amid looming collective bargaining agreement discussions, with Manfred expressing confidence despite past concerns about implementing changes before bargaining. The average ABS challenge in the minor leagues has taken 17 seconds, so this should not affect the pace of play. The implementation of ABS would mark a substantial shift in baseball, potentially altering the game's dynamics and strategy. Optimism in the system is high given the success in the minor leagues.</p>

Cristiano Ronaldo, playing his 220th game for Portugal, scored the winning goal, marking his 137th international goal and ending his personal losing streak against Germany. Kimmich expressed disappointment in Germany's performance, citing a lack of energy and activity, while Portugal's coach praised Ronaldo's enduring hunger for victory. The game was delayed due to a storm, but Ronaldo's performance stole the show, leading Portugal to the Nations League final.

          <p>The Trump administration has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, citing concerns that the school is not a trustworthy steward of international student programs. The order claims Harvard failed to report students' disciplinary records and criticizes its ties to researchers based in China. A Harvard spokesperson condemned the order as an illegal retaliatory step violating the school's First Amendment rights. This action follows previous attempts by the administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, including efforts to revoke the school's certification in the federal government's student visa database. The move intensifies the ongoing feud between the Trump administration and Harvard over issues such as pro-Palestinian protests and alleged antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is meeting with Senate Republicans to push for the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a sweeping immigration and tax bill. The bill faces opposition from some GOP members due to concerns about the national debt and changes to Medicaid. Elon Musk has also criticized the bill, calling it an "abomination." Simultaneously, Trump's increased steel and aluminum tariffs have gone into effect, doubling from 25% to 50%. The tariffs are facing criticism from key trading partners.

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's actions as president, claiming that Biden's aides masked his cognitive decline. The inquiry will build on existing Republican efforts to discredit Biden and reverse some of his executive actions. GOP lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. A separate investigation has been launched into clemencies Biden issued during his final days in office. Trump alleges that Biden's use of an autopen to sign executive actions warrants scrutiny. Democrats have dismissed the investigations as a distraction from the current administration's issues.</p>

Partial restrictions apply to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The new travel ban is the result of an executive order Trump signed on his first day back in the White House.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The research highlights how the development of these feathers enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The study, which examined feathers dating back 99 million years, focused on the structural evolution of feathers during the Cretaceous period. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities as modern birds, although some species may have been capable of gliding or powered flight. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of avian evolution.</p>

          <p>A New York prosecutor argues that the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was an act of terrorism, citing the fear it instilled in healthcare executives. The prosecutor's argument is supported by the fact that healthcare executives felt terrorized. Following the shooting, approximately 40 UHC executives sought bodyguards, and one executive even dyed her hair and relocated due to safety concerns. The prosecutor emphasizes that the writings left behind by the accused, Luigi Mangione, reveal his target was the insurance industry. The murder had the desired effect, fueling a panic in the company and the wider healthcare insurance industry.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a baby's gut may offer protection against dangerous infections. The research indicates that infants with the bacteria Bifidobacterium longum in their gut had a significantly lower risk of hospitalization for lung infections. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, tracked the babies' health for two years. The protective effect was primarily observed in babies born via vaginal delivery, as opposed to caesarean section. Researchers believe the bacteria or compounds produced by it interact with the immune system, aiding in its maturation and ability to distinguish between harmful and harmless substances.</p>

          <h2>Legal Setback Delays Offshore Oil Restart Near Santa Barbara</h2>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order, halting efforts to restart an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara due to environmental concerns. Sable Offshore Corp. must delay its restart timeline after the court sided with environmental groups challenging the operation's onshore pipeline system. The restraining order will remain in effect until at least July 18, pending a full hearing. Environmental groups argue that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without conducting environmental review or public process. The legal challenge stems from concerns about potential harms from the pipeline, which caused a significant oil spill in 2015.</p>

The judge's order aims to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case.

Soliman, an Egyptian national, is facing multiple charges, including attempted murder and a federal hate crimes charge.
