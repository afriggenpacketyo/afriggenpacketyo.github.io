          <p>Birmingham City Council has obtained a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles leaving depots, as refuse workers continue their strike action. The council estimates that over 12,000 tonnes of waste have accumulated due to the disruptions, which began in January and intensified in March. The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the Unite union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The council insists it has provided numerous opportunities for Unite to cooperate and avoid legal action, emphasizing its public health duty to clear waste.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's legal battle over his personal security arrangements has effectively ended after the Court of Appeal rejected his challenge. The court ruled that Harry misunderstood how the Royal Family's protection is organized and how his decision to step back from royal duties impacted his security. The case centered on Ravec, the body authorizing security for senior royals, which Harry believed treated him unfairly. The court found that Ravec had carefully considered his security needs but determined that his new role as a non-working royal living abroad fell outside its remit.</p>

          <p>Many women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are scared to get pregnant due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts if they come off contraceptive medication. Contraceptive medication remains the primary course of treatment for women living with PMDD, but for women who wish to become pregnant this poses a dilemma. The Welsh government has acknowledged the need for improved diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD. Women are advised to keep a detailed diary of their symptoms to aid in diagnosis.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting it would create 70,000 jobs and boost the U.S. economy by $14 billion. Trump's social media post suggests he approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, despite prior concerns about national security risks. Both steelmakers welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers and national security. The Committee on Foreign Investment previously reviewed the deal, with Trump eventually ordering a reexamination.</p>

          <h2>Germany Acknowledges Nazi Past but Struggles with Inconvenient Truths</h2>

          <p>Germany prides itself on reckoning with its Nazi past, yet often falls short when it's inconvenient. The Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter, exemplifies this selective memory. Journalists continue to accept the award, effectively whitewashing the legacy of a man who oversaw the abuse and killing of thousands. This amnesia extends to other wealthy families who profited from Nazi collaboration, and to streets named after colonial administrators. Germany's approach to remembrance is carefully curated, embraced when it flatters its self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain.</p>
