        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant surge after the European satellite operator announced a substantial capital raise, primarily supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, amounting to 1.35 billion euros, aims to bolster Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. This move positions the French state as Eutelsat's largest shareholder, with nearly 30% of capital and voting rights, highlighting the company's strategic role in supporting sectors like military communications and cybersecurity, aligning with EU and NATO objectives. Eutelsat had also secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority access to its OneWeb LEO constellation. The surge reflects optimism regarding Eutelsat's potential as a European alternative to Starlink. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a sharp decline in May, primarily driven by a 'dismal' performance in supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes dropped by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, with reduced purchases of alcohol and tobacco contributing to the downturn. Government borrowing also rose to the second-highest level for May since 1993, reflecting increased spending partially due to inflation-linked benefit uplifts. While sales volumes in the three months to May showed a slight increase, economists suggest the data indicates a slowdown in economic growth following a strong start to the year. </p>

          <p>The Iranian American community in Los Angeles, particularly in the area known as 'Tehrangeles,' is experiencing heightened anxiety due to recent Israeli strikes on Iran. Many residents have family members in both Iran and Israel, leading to concerns about their safety and the potential for further escalation. The community is diverse, with varying opinions about the conflict and the future of Iran, and some express fears of backlash or scapegoating if the U.S. becomes involved. Despite the uncertainty, community members are maintaining their traditions and hoping for peace and stability. </p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully tested artillery-launched drones capable of surviving the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell. After 12 years of technical challenges, five live-fire trials confirmed the drones could endure launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. The advance centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism, co-developed by the Shaanxi Applied Physics and Chemistry Research Institute, the Chinese air force, and defense contractor Norinco. These drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, multiplying flight range and extending loiter time. </p>

The author also notes that Trump's policies could negatively affect Medicare. The article highlights the role of immigration and the potential impact of eliminating the cap on wages subject to payroll tax, suggesting that the wealthy should pay their fair share of the program.

Workers had previously raised concerns about short staffing and potentially flawed testing procedures as avian flu spread through millions of birds and cattle herds. The union alleges that UC Davis has refused to release the requested records, violating California's public records laws, while UC Davis denies that workplace issues have affected the lab's ability to handle bird flu testing.

While the musical deals with serious themes such as antisemitism and systemic bias, it also tells the story of a marriage that grows in depth as external reality becomes more treacherous.

While the number of lawsuits has increased, so has the average payout per case, with a significant rise in million-dollar verdicts.

While ICE claims anonymity is necessary due to increased threats against officers, critics argue that it undermines public trust and creates dangerous situations where people cannot distinguish law enforcement from criminals. The lack of transparency and accountability is seen as a threat to democracy and public safety. </p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed charges against real estate agent Iman Shaghyan for increasing the price of a Beverly Hills rental by over 30% after the January fires, marking the fourth charge under price-gouging rules. Despite thousands of complaints, some critics argue that government officials aren't doing enough to address rampant price gouging. Activist organizations are tracking listings and submitting reports, but transparency remains a problem. In addition to criminal charges, the state has sent warning letters to hotels and landlords, and is investigating fraud related to burned properties. </p>

          <p>A columnist reflects on the disturbing trend of America leaning into autocracy, drawing parallels with antidemocratic countries abroad. The commentary highlights incidents such as military-style immigration raids, the federalization of the National Guard against protesters, and the politicization of the military, painting a picture of a nation slipping into authoritarian ways. The author contrasts these events with President Reagan’s vision of America as a shining 'city upon a hill,' emphasizing the heavy toll that Trump’s policies have taken on America’s reputation. The piece conveys a sense of fear for the country's freedoms, particularly when viewed from abroad. </p>

          <p>A recent rally at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, featuring President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has sparked controversy due to its partisan nature and the presence of uniformed soldiers. Soldiers were reportedly screened based on political leanings and physical appearance, leading to concerns about the military being forced to choose sides. This event has been criticized for violating Defense Department regulations, injecting partisan acid into the 82nd Airborne, and potentially damaging the military's standing with a large segment of the American public. The incident underscores the importance of maintaining a nonpartisan military to ensure cohesion and public trust. </p>

          <p>A West Coast sheriff is considering implementing a new county ordinance that would require irresponsible hikers to pay for their rescue if their actions are deemed reckless or negligent. This proposal comes in response to a surge in search-and-rescue missions in Skamania County, Washington, particularly around Mt. St. Helens, where several incidents involved individuals taking exceptional risks. The idea of charging for rescues has been debated before, with some states like New Hampshire offering 'Hike Safe Cards' to support search-and-rescue efforts, while organizations like the Mountain Rescue Assn. express concern that such charges could deter people from seeking help promptly. The goal is to deter risky behavior and recoup the financial burden on the county. </p>

          <p>Heightened immigration enforcement activities in Southern California have sparked fear and uncertainty among public transit riders, leading to a notable decline in ridership. Reports of federal agents detaining commuters at bus stops have prompted concerns about targeting public transportation, with Metro officials reporting a 10% to 15% drop in bus and rail ridership since the sweeps began. The increased law enforcement presence outside schools and around bus stops aims to protect the community amidst the fear, and Metro is working to build back public trust by amplifying 'Know Your Rights' campaigns to support immigrant riders. Many riders rely on public transit out of necessity, and the raids have created a quiet tension on buses as people fearfully resume their schedules. </p>

In June, rates rose for the third straight month, reaching the highest level since December, and the average APR is now over 20%.
