          <h2>Trump's Tariffs: Potential Impacts on UK Consumers and Businesses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-03 04:53:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly announced tariffs on imported goods into the US, including a 10% levy on UK goods, create uncertainty about their effects on British consumers and businesses. Economists predict potential price increases in the UK due to increased import costs and possible retaliatory tariffs. However, some suggest prices could fall as UK businesses may redirect exports to avoid US tariffs, potentially flooding the UK market with cheaper goods.  The impact on UK jobs, particularly in export-oriented sectors like car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, is also a major concern.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs impose a 10% levy on Scotch whisky exports to the US, the industry's most important overseas market.  Distilleries like Kilchoman face a significant challenge, representing 10% of their sales.  The industry previously suffered substantial losses from similar tariffs in 2019, and distilleries are exploring strategies to absorb the costs and maintain prices for American consumers. The current economic climate further exacerbates the impact of these tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs are set to impact Apple's global supply chain, affecting production in countries like China, India, and Vietnam.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney vows a forceful response to President Trump's new tariffs, despite Canada's exemption from some of the new measures. Carney emphasizes that existing tariffs already significantly impact millions of Canadians.  The response will be determined after consultations with provincial and territorial premiers.  While Canada avoids additional tariffs, the 25% tax on foreign-made cars remains a concern for Canada's car industry, heavily intertwined with the US market.  Carney's response has been politically advantageous for his party in the ongoing federal election.</p>
