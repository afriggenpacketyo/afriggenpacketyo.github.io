          <p>A man in Byneset, Norway, awoke to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, narrowly missing his house. The 135-meter Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, NCL Salten, carrying 16 people, veered off course in the Trondheim Fjord and ended up meters from Johan Helberg's bedroom window. No injuries were reported, and authorities are investigating the cause of the incident. The ship had previously run aground in 2023, but managed to free itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This translates to an annual saving of Â£129 for a typical household, bringing the average bill down to Â£1,720. While charities welcome the reduction, they emphasize that many families are still burdened by significant energy debt. The regulator suggests that switching to a fixed deal could offer further savings, though this option may not be available to those with existing debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Columbia has stated it will continue to work with the government to combat antisemitism and discrimination.

The Chinese carmaker's BEV sales jumped 169% year-on-year in April, while Tesla's sales declined by 49%. This achievement occurred despite the EU imposing hefty tariffs on cars imported from mainland China. Overall, BEVs accounted for 17% of new car registrations in Europe in April, with Chinese firms contributing significantly to the growth in BEV sales.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of 'DEI Hire' as a Weaponized Insult</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "DEI hire" is being used as a playground taunt and weaponized insult, feeding an age-old grievance that someone has a job that could have been yours. This creates a climate where previously unsayable prejudices can be voiced confidently, fostering doubt even in successful individuals from non-traditional backgrounds. Social media has amplified this issue, turning private whispers into public barrages of abuse, undermining confidence. It's crucial to prevent these prejudices from spilling into real-life conversations to maintain equality and inclusivity.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed a stark contrast in priorities, with Trump focusing on unsubstantiated claims of white genocide. The meeting, intended to address economic and trade issues, was overshadowed by Trump's promotion of a video supporting the idea that white people face genocidal violence in South Africa. The event underscored Trump's tendency to prioritize scoring points with his base over engaging in meaningful diplomatic discussions. Ramaphosa, despite the confrontational setting, extended an invitation for Trump to attend the G20 summit in South Africa later in the year.</p>
