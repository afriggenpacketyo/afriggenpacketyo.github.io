          <p>This article provides a detailed overview of tariffs, explaining them as taxes on imported goods designed to encourage domestic purchasing and manufacturing. It outlines President Trump's recent implementation of significant tariffs on various goods and from numerous countries, including China, Mexico, and the European Union, as part of his trade policy. The strategy has caused global economic volatility and is criticized for potentially raising consumer prices in the U.S. Despite legal challenges and criticism from within his own party, Trump maintains the strategy is necessary to reduce the trade deficit and protect American jobs.

          <p>An issue with the UK's air traffic control system led to significant flight disruptions, with passengers facing numerous cancellations and delays across all UK airports. The provider, NATS, stated the radar-related problem was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system, but the knock-on effects are expected to last for days. Airlines have expressed frustration over the failure, which occurred during the busy summer travel season, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. While normal operations are resuming, travelers are urged to check with their airlines as schedules are still being adjusted to clear the backlog.</p>

          <p>Eyewitness accounts have emerged detailing a brutal attack on a church in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where jihadists from the Allied Democratic Forces killed at least 49 Christians. The victims, including nine children, were attacked with machetes during a silver jubilee prayer service, with some being decapitated. Survivors and local partners of the charity Open Doors described a scene of widespread sadness and fear, as the attackers abducted several children and burned down local shops. This event is part of a broader pattern of violence by Islamist groups aiming to establish a caliphate in the predominantly Christian nation.</p>

          <p>A new report has found that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) failed to listen to a mother's concerns before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir. The boy died from a lung infection just days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department with antibiotics. The investigation concluded that healthcare providers repeatedly dismissed the family's insights, prioritizing clinical metrics over caregiver intuition, which led to a lack of trust and collaborative decision-making. The family is now demanding a full inquest and accountability, while the NHS has accepted the report's recommendations for improving communication and training.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from his position following mounting pressure from a corruption probe into his past and current business dealings. The investigations, spurred by media reports, involve allegations of misconduct, including his failure to pay a large fine from a 2012 conviction for abuse of position.

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO for a second time is being framed as a significant blow to America's global standing on human rights and free expression. Critics argue this move is part of a broader pattern of disengaging from international obligations and reflects a disregard for cultural preservation and diversity. The article compares this action to authoritarian regimes that target culture to control narratives, such as the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas. Advocacy groups are urging Congress to reverse the decision, warning that it isolates the U.S. and undermines efforts to promote democratic values worldwide.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that a majority of the more than 109,000 arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the first five months of President Trump's second term occurred in Southern and border states. Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California, continuing a geographic trend but with a sharp 120% increase in total arrests compared to the same period in 2024. The data shows most arrested individuals were from Latin American countries, primarily Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Despite Fairlife's claims of humane treatment and high standards, which helped it become a billion-dollar brand, these repeated investigations raise serious questions about its oversight and marketing.

          <p>A federal appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments regarding the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The case challenges a lower court's ruling that the president lacked the authority to implement the duties, which is a centerpiece of his economic agenda. Challengers, including 12 states and several small businesses, argue that the law does not authorize tariffs and that Trump's use of it grants the executive branch limitless power. The administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies like trade deficits and illicit drug trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

The review highlights the film's clever wordplay, escalating pratfalls, and ability to update its humor for a modern audience without losing the franchise's core comedic essence.

His final appeals were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>According to hospital officials in Gaza, more than 50 Palestinians were killed and hundreds were injured after Israeli forces allegedly fired on crowds waiting for food aid near the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported the casualties, while the Israeli military stated its troops fired only “warning shots” and was unaware of any deaths from its fire. The incident occurred as a U.S. special envoy arrived in Israel and as the UN warns of a deepening famine. This event adds to the growing international outrage over the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the immense difficulty of distributing aid within the territory.</p>

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, dropped by as much as 11% after the company reported a significant decline in second-quarter sales volumes. The 1.9% year-on-year decrease was much worse than analysts had anticipated, driven by weak performance in key markets like China and Brazil. Despite the falling volumes, the maker of Budweiser and Corona saw its operating profit and revenue increase, as consumers paid higher prices for its products. However, analysts suggest the scale of the volume miss is likely to overshadow the profit growth and weigh heavily on the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including prominent lawyers, has warned the UK government that its plan to recognize a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the criteria for statehood outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets conditions like agreeing to a ceasefire. A government minister defended the plan, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened Canada with trade repercussions after it announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, stating the move will make it “very hard” to secure a trade deal. This statement escalates trade tensions just before an August 1 deadline for a tariff agreement, after which Canada could face a 35% tariff on certain goods. Canada's announcement follows similar pledges from the UK and France, increasing international pressure on Israel amid the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Meanwhile, a German delegation is heading to the region to push for a ceasefire and address the dire situation.</p>

          <p>An Israeli settler suspected of fatally shooting a Palestinian activist was previously sanctioned by the Biden administration for violence, but those sanctions were lifted by the Trump administration. The activist, Awdah Hathaleen, was involved with the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land." The settler, Yinon Levi, had sanctions imposed last year for allegedly inciting violence against Palestinian civilians, which he denied. Shortly after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order removing Levi and others from the sanctions list. The State Department has deferred to the Israeli government to investigate the killing, while a Democratic congressman condemned the lifting of sanctions.</p>

Jaouad suggests that reading passages from other writers' diaries can provide fresh perspectives and overcome writer's block. For those new to journaling, she recommends setting a consistent time, folding it into an existing daily routine, and keeping the barrier to entry low by not worrying about the “right” way to do it.</p>
