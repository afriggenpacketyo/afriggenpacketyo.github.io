          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals with experience in destinations like the Maldives and Bali, discuss the differences between vacationing and living in paradise. They emphasize the communal aspect of staff villages, akin to summer camps, and the challenges of managing diverse personalities within these communities. Saltwater-related maintenance issues and environmental concerns, such as humidity and forest reclamation, also present unique challenges. Despite the challenges, LeBlanc and Robinson value their experiences and enjoy sharing their story with curious hotel guests, finding fulfillment in their work and life together in remote locations.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at Lemon Hill in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park resulted in the deaths of Amya Devlin, 23, and Mikhail Bowers, 21, with nine others injured.

Mayor Cherelle Parker confirmed that three different types of shell casings were found at the scene, indicating the involvement of three shooters.

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth unmanned test flight of the Starship spacecraft from its Starbase facility in Texas, aiming to achieve a safe and reliable return. This test follows two previous flights that resulted in the destruction of the spacecraft and debris falling across South Florida and parts of the Atlantic. The company has made modifications based on lessons learned from the previous failures, including hardware and vibration-related issues. The current test involves the first launch of a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, with the booster attempting a hard splashdown in the Gulf after testing new flight and landing configurations, and the Starship upper stage aiming to deploy Starlink satellite simulators and relight a Raptor engine in space.</p>

Abrego Garcia's deportation has been controversial, with the Trump administration citing evidence of his gang affiliation and abuse allegations, while Democrats claim he was denied due process.

Judge Esther Salas, whose son was killed in 2020 by a self-described ‚Äúanti-feminist‚Äù lawyer, provided the data, emphasizing the alarming nature of the increase.

Dylan, who entered the U.S. legally under a Biden administration program, was arrested after attending a mandatory hearing.

          <p>A new study reveals that the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the past 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. The research, based on NASA satellite imagery, underscores the severity of the water crisis in the southwestern United States, with groundwater disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water. Overpumping, particularly for agriculture, is identified as the main cause, with the depletion rate accelerating since 2015. The study calls for better management of groundwater supplies, especially in Arizona, where groundwater usage remains largely unregulated.</p>

The Al-Basma Fertility Centre, which housed nearly 4,000 frozen embryos and over 1,000 samples of sperm and eggs, was shelled, leading to the destruction of the samples due to the evaporation of liquid nitrogen. The UN has accused Israel of intentionally attacking the clinic to prevent births among Palestinians, an allegation Israel denies.

          <p>President Trump is set to pardon Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of the reality TV show ‚ÄúChrisley Knows Best,‚Äù who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The White House announced that Trump would grant full pardons to the couple, who were sentenced to prison, following their conviction on charges stemming from a scheme involving fake financial statements to obtain millions in loans. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, has been a vocal advocate for her parents, alleging corruption in the court proceedings and supporting Trump. Savannah shared that Trump personally called her to inform her of the pardons.</p>

The victim claims he was held captive for 17 days, threatened, tortured, and forced to smoke crack cocaine, before escaping and reporting the incident to police.

Authorities have been searching for the escapees after they broke out of the Orleans Justice Center by exploiting a faulty cell door, a hole behind a toilet, and a barbed-wire fence. Officials have cited multiple security lapses in the jail, including a maintenance worker allegedly turning off the water to the toilet, aiding the escape.

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI technology with overhead cameras at some self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, which has led to customers comparing it to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in football. The system identifies when shoppers fail to scan items properly and shows a live-action replay. While some shoppers mocked the technology, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, with retailers reporting millions of thefts costing billions of pounds.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, attributed to reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities, coupled with increasing competition. Musk's endorsement of a far-right party in Germany and clashes with Scandinavian labor groups have damaged Tesla's brand value. Protests have erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe in response to Musk's political views. Despite launching an upgraded Model Y, Tesla's aging lineup and the growing popularity of hybrid electric vehicles further contributed to the sales decline.</p>

Ambila's lawyers argued that ICE held him illegally without providing information about their plans and that the federal government has been unable to secure travel papers for him since 2007. The judge cited the lack of evidence that the DRC would accept Ambila and ordered the government to halt deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>Chaos broke out at a new aid center in the Gaza Strip, where humanitarian assistance was being distributed through an Israeli-backed effort, as desperate Palestinians surged toward the site. The distribution site in Tel al-Sultan experienced chaotic scenes with crowds rushing for supplies and gunfire heard in the distance, causing panic. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation stated that the volume of people prompted their team to retreat to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely. The Israeli military acknowledged firing warning shots in the area outside the compound, but critics argue that the plan puts Palestinian civilians at risk.</p>
