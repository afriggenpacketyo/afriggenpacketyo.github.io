          <p>Suriname initiated parliamentary elections to determine the government that will manage the nation's newfound oil wealth. The country faces challenges like high debt, inflation, and poverty, affecting nearly one-fifth of its 600,000 residents. Offshore crude discoveries offer the potential for economic transformation. Incumbent President Chan Santokhi seeks a mandate to utilize the anticipated income for the benefit of the Surinamese people, promising to improve living standards and ensure that everyone benefits from the nation's growth. The new parliament will select a president and vice-president to oversee this period of change.</p>

          <p>President Zelenskyy stated that the US's "silence" following recent Russian attacks emboldens President Putin, referencing Moscow's most extensive aerial assault to date. The overnight attack involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across Ukraine. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for "strong pressure on the Russian leadership" to halt Russia's brutality. He criticized the lack of response from senior US officials, aside from Trump's special envoy, and implied that further sanctions are needed to incentivize Russia to engage in ceasefire talks. The Russian defense ministry claims to have inflicted damage on military airfields, ammunition depots, and electric warfare stations across 142 areas.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election is critical for restoring domestic stability and navigating complex geopolitics following former president Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment. Society is divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable presidential candidate. Opposition Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls and has shifted towards the center, focusing on domestic priorities and pragmatic foreign policy. The new president must address economic concerns and manage South Korea's position in the midst of major power competition to ensure national security and long-term stability.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the PGMOL, the referees' organization, following a controversial decision during their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United. The club believes that a "big mistake" by referee Thomas Bramall significantly contributed to their loss and denied them a Champions League spot. Bramall incorrectly called a foul against Villa when Morgan Rogers scored, preventing VAR intervention. The club's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed dissatisfaction with the selection of Bramall, citing his inexperience for such a crucial match.</p>

Two more children are missing and presumed dead, while the doctor’s husband and another child were injured. The Israeli military stated they struck suspects near Israeli forces but are investigating if uninvolved civilians were harmed. The New York Times verified video footage showing emergency workers recovering bodies from the strike site, which occurred amidst renewed fighting between Israel and Hamas. This incident adds to the already immense civilian toll in Gaza, where more than 50,000 people have been killed since the start of the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, "emotionally safe parenting" is a new framework that emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs. This approach prioritizes building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations, setting clear boundaries with empathy, and encouraging independence. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, avoid shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves.</p>

The Trump family has collected millions from cryptocurrency ventures, overseas real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. A recent example is Qatar's donation of a luxury jet valued at $200 million for Mr. Trump's use, raising ethical concerns. While the White House defends these actions, critics argue that Mr. Trump has dismantled accountability measures, leading to a lack of official investigations into potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>Federal officials arrested Joseph Neumayer, a dual US and German citizen, at John F Kennedy airport in New York for allegedly attempting to firebomb the Tel Aviv branch office of the US embassy in Israel. Neumayer is accused of arriving at the embassy branch office with a backpack containing molotov cocktails and spitting on an embassy guard. Authorities claim that a social media account linked to Neumayer contained threats to assassinate Donald Trump and expressed hatred towards America and the West. The FBI director stated that such violent behavior would not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Iran summoned France's envoy in Tehran to protest against "insulting" remarks made by the French foreign minister after Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. French foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Panahi's win was "a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression". Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Tanhaei called the comments "insulting remarks and unfounded allegations", state media reported. Tanhaei described Barrot's comments as "blatant interference" in the country's internal affairs, adding that France had "no moral authority at all" to comment on Iran.</p>

Kevin De Bruyne's departure marks the end of an era, while questions linger over the futures of several other players. Guardiola emphasized that new faces will arrive, particularly in weaker positions, but doesn't anticipate a major overhaul. The club's financial strength positions them well for spending this summer, though a move for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz is unlikely due to cost.</p>

However, he stated that the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP but rather works on fraud, waste, and abuse. He also said that these requirements are not burdensome, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week.</p>
