          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has responded to Russia's offer for direct peace talks, stating that a full and temporary ceasefire must be in place before negotiations can commence. While Zelenskyy views Russia's consideration of ending the conflict as a positive sign, he emphasizes the necessity of a ceasefire as the initial step. However, British Ambassador Peter Mandelson has expressed skepticism regarding the sincerity of Putin's ceasefire proposal, while Russia has accused Ukraine of violating its own truce, deeming it a farce. The article highlights the ongoing tensions and differing perspectives surrounding potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, with the U.S. and European leaders also weighing in on the matter.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at de-escalating trade tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war. The talks carry significant implications for the global economy, which has been destabilized by tariffs imposed by both countries. While both governments have adopted a tough stance, there are indications that officials are seeking a path to reduce tariffs, as they are already disrupting global supply chains. Economists have cautioned that the trade dispute could hinder global growth and fuel inflation, potentially leading the United States into a recession.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in creative and business decision-making. Diller emphasizes that relying solely on data can be detrimental, as it focuses on past events rather than future possibilities. He argues that too much information can complicate and obscure the essence of an idea, which should be evaluated based on its inherent quality and common sense. Diller recounts instances where trusting his instincts led to successful projects like 'Brian's Song' and 'The Night Stalker,' highlighting the value of simple human instinct in the entertainment industry.</p>

The government expects these measures to reduce the number of lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK by up to 50,000 over the next year. The move aims to address net migration, which has been a challenge for successive governments, and will also include new training commitments to help unemployed individuals re-enter the UK labor market.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that the issues in Newark are indicative of broader problems with aging U.S. aviation infrastructure. The FAA is working to address the disruptions that have affected hundreds of flights. A similar equipment outage occurred before dawn on Friday. Runway construction at Newark has added to delays, vexing executives as the busy summer travel season approaches.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests extending Father's Day into a month-long celebration. Gaffigan envisions Father's Day Month as an off-and-on holiday, with Dads receiving presents on even days and enjoying a communication-free "Ramadad" on odd days. While the idea is presented tongue-in-cheek, it serves as a comedic tribute to fathers and their contributions. The article reflects on the importance of acknowledging and appreciating both mothers and fathers, albeit with a humorous twist. Gaffigan's commentary offers a lighthearted take on the balance of celebrations and recognition within families.</p>
