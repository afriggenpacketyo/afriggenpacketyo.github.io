          <p>Australia's government has declared its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the decision supports a two-state solution as the best path to peace, following consultations with allies like the UK, France, and Canada. The recognition is contingent on commitments from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will have no role in a future state. This move comes amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and has been criticized by Israel as a "reward for terrorism."</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to an unprecedented deal with the U.S. government, paying 15% of their revenue from specific high-tech chip sales to China. This arrangement was a condition for securing export licenses, allowing the companies to sell their advanced AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the Chinese market after previous bans. While the move signals easing trade tensions, some analysts question the logic of addressing national security concerns with a financial payment. The deal highlights the strategic complexities of the global tech trade. (not investment advice)</p>

Traders are closely watching the potential impacts of U.S. tariffs and upcoming American inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. The Reserve Bank of India has been actively intervening in currency markets to stabilize the rupee against external pressures. A softer U.S. dollar, driven by expectations of a Fed rate cut, is also anticipated to support the Indian currency's position. (not investment advice)</p>

These drinks, sold in convenience stores, are reportedly highly addictive, with some individuals recounting severe withdrawal symptoms and dependency. The company behind Feel Free, Botanic Tonics, has faced a class-action lawsuit for allegedly failing to warn consumers of the risks, which it settled without admitting wrongdoing.

          <p>Two blind women traveling from New Orleans to Orlando reported a significant communication failure by Southwest Airlines after they were left as the only passengers on their flight. Following a nearly five-hour delay, they discovered that most other passengers had been rebooked onto an earlier flight from a different gate, a change they were never informed of. The women argue the airline failed to meet its legal obligation under the Air Carrier Access Act to provide effective communication for passengers with disabilities. Southwest disputed the characterization that the customers were "forgotten."</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its policy to deport foreign criminals before their appeals are heard, adding 15 new countries including Canada, India, and Australia to the scheme. This "deport now, appeal later" system is designed to prevent offenders from using the appeals process to prolong their stay in the UK.

          <p>As part of a new road safety strategy, the UK government is considering implementing compulsory eye tests for drivers over the age of 70. The proposed change would require older motorists to pass an eye test every three years upon renewing their license, or risk being banned from driving. This move follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's "lax" licensing system after several fatal accidents involving drivers with poor eyesight. The strategy also includes proposals to tighten drink-driving limits and introduce penalties for passengers not wearing seatbelts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones theoretically produce a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. This phenomenon occurs as a baby black hole, created from a star's collapse or a merger, settles into a stable, perfect shape defined by its mass and spin. During this brief, violent process, the distortion of spacetime rings out, analogous to a bell. These vibrations, predicted by general relativity, are a pure expression of the black hole's fundamental properties, offering a unique way to study these cosmic objects.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three years old. An analysis of the policy suggests it will have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the handout represents a larger percentage of average income. For example, the subsidy amounts to over 13% of an average resident's annual income in Gansu province, compared to just 4% in Shanghai. This disparity could lead to a greater boost in consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs within the NHS, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing hospital trusts to hire more proactively based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. While nursing unions have welcomed the move as a positive step, they caution that its success will depend on whether graduates can actually find jobs. Trust representatives have also raised questions about funding.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as a 30-year-old man who blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for personal health issues. The shooter killed DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose before being killed himself during the incident. The man was armed with five guns and had become fixated on his distrust of vaccines, according to his father and neighbors. A union representing CDC workers stated the attack was not random and called on federal officials to condemn vaccine misinformation, which they argue fuels hostility.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered another strong performance, seemingly closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing several passes and rushing for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, veteran Taylor Heinicke appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the Chargers' defensive depth, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown, strengthening his roster case.</p>

          <p>A pair of large, lightning-caused wildfires are burning across western Colorado, with the Lee Fire growing to become one of the largest in state history. The blaze has scorched over 167,000 acres, forcing evacuations in multiple counties and prompting the precautionary evacuation of all 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center. Firefighters are contending with hot, windy conditions and drought-stressed fuels, making containment difficult. The fires have also led to significant air quality concerns as more than a thousand personnel work to protect homes and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a plausible, though not yet proven in humans, link between nose-picking and an increased risk of dementia. Researchers found that bacteria could travel up the olfactory nerve to the brain, particularly when the nasal tissue was damaged. This bacterial presence triggered a response in the mouse brains—the deposit of amyloid-beta proteins—that resembles a key sign of Alzheimer's disease. While the findings are preliminary and require human studies, they offer a new avenue for understanding environmental factors in the disease's onset.</p>

He stated they would be given places to stay "far from the Capital" and vowed to make the city safer and more beautiful. This follows an order to deploy federal law enforcement to the city's streets to curb what he calls "out of control" crime. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back, stating that while crime spiked in 2023, current data shows a significant decrease in violent crime.</p>

To block the move, which could give the GOP five more House seats, Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to conduct business. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker defended the Texas Democrats' actions, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the lawmakers arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special sessions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports as a potential response to Beijing's continued purchasing of Russian oil. Vice-President J.D. Vance confirmed that President Trump is "thinking about it" but has not yet made a firm decision, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China economic relationship. This move would represent another escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure countries seen as supporting Russia's economy during its war in Ukraine. Beijing responded that its trade with Russia is normal and legal. (not investment advice)</p>
