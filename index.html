          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has publicly refuted rumors that he would exit his re-election campaign, emphatically stating his intention to defeat Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Running as an independent, Adams criticized both Mamdani and fellow independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, labeling them as out-of-touch "spoiled brats." He also denied reports of potential discussions to join the Trump administration, asserting his focus remains on serving New Yorkers for another four years despite unfavorable polling.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will host the G20 summit in 2026, coinciding with the nation's 250th anniversary. The event is slated to be held at his Doral golf resort in Florida, a plan he previously abandoned for a G7 summit during his first term amid criticism. Trump dismissed concerns about profiting from the presidency and stated that both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be welcome to attend as observers. The president also confirmed he will not attend this year's G20 summit in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Reigning champions Chelsea started their Women's Super League title defense with a hard-fought victory against Manchester City. Despite not being at their peak performance, the team demonstrated their characteristic ruthlessness to secure the win. The match featured impressive debuts, notably from Chelsea's Ellie Carpenter, who provided a key assist and was a constant threat. While both teams are still developing, the result reinforces Chelsea's status as the team to beat in the league.</p>

Representing 40% of the world's population and a substantial portion of global GDP, the SCO's influence is growing, with strong economic projections for members like China and India. The inclusion of new members such as Iran highlights its expanding reach and potential to create a more multipolar world.</p>

          <p>A state watchdog panel has publicly admonished Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Enrique Monguia for a pattern of serious misconduct. The Commission on Judicial Performance found that Monguia made inappropriate and threatening remarks, including threatening to shoot people in his courtroom. He was also cited for making discourteous and biased comments towards defendants, attorneys, and crime victims, constituting an abuse of his judicial authority. Judge Monguia did not contest the admonishment and expressed remorse for his actions.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, who passed away at 91, is remembered for revolutionizing red carpet fashion and building a global empire by harnessing the power of celebrity. Before his influence, awards shows were often sartorial disasters, but Armani saw an opportunity, famously dressing Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" and establishing a strong presence in Hollywood. He transformed the red carpet into a high-fashion runway, making his relaxed, elegant suits a staple for stars and solidifying his role as Hollywood's preeminent couturier.</p>

          <p>Recent social media posts have fueled speculation about President Donald Trump's health, focusing on images that appear to show lumps under his clothing. Some users theorized he might be wearing a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a medical heart pump. However, this article finds the claim highly unlikely, as implanting an LVAD requires major open-heart surgery and a significant recovery period incompatible with the president's recent public schedule. The article concludes that the shapes could be anything from a shirt crease to jacket padding, and any claims are pure speculation.</p>

          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial strategists advise investors to consider defensive measures to protect their significant portfolio gains. Despite the market's strong performance, a weakening labor market and uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy and tariffs could introduce volatility. Experts suggest reviewing portfolio concentration, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indexes. They recommend broadening exposure by shifting some capital from recent winners into value and defensive sectors that have been overlooked during the latest rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a social media post, President Donald Trump commented that the U.S. has "lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China," suggesting a geopolitical shift. His remarks, accompanied by a photo of the three nations' leaders at a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, come as his administration's tariff policies have strained relations with New Delhi. The statement reflects a perception of a growing alliance between the three powers, with China's embassy in Washington responding that its relationships are not targeted at any third party.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is struggling to fill numerous key government positions, leading to a practice of "dual-hatting," where a small circle of officials holds multiple roles simultaneously. For example, Marco Rubio has been serving in four different jobs, while other nominees are slated to hold positions at both the White House and independent agencies like the Federal Reserve. This chronic short-staffing creates potential conflicts of interest and hampers the executive branch's ability to govern effectively, even as the administration aims to expand its authority.</p>

          <p>Chicago and surrounding areas are bracing for a significant increase in U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, with up to 300 agents expected in the region.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have pushed back against the federal intervention. In response to the planned ICE activity, the city's Mexican Independence Day festival has been postponed over community safety concerns.</p>

The author argues that commenting on anyone's hair, especially in the context of illness, is a harmful invasion of privacy that reinforces stigma around hair loss and body image. She contends that whether Middleton is wearing a wig or not is irrelevant and that public figures deserve the same privacy as anyone else to navigate personal health challenges without scrutiny.</p>

This unilateral disarmament allows autocratic rivals like China and Russia to fill the void with their own propaganda, harming U.S. interests and global access to free information.</p>
