          <h2>Republican Lawmakers Remain Uncharacteristically Silent on Denial of US Stopover for Taiwanese President</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House's reported decision to deny a transit stop in New York for Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te has drawn criticism from Democrats but has been met with unusual silence from Republicans. This muted response is notable as the Republican party has historically been a vocal supporter of high-profile engagement with Taiwan. The article suggests this shift in posture may be linked to ongoing, high-stakes trade negotiations between the United States and China. Democratic leaders have formally expressed grave concern that this move signals a dangerous concession to Beijing.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic cricket match in The Hundred, Southern Brave clinched a one-wicket victory against Manchester Originals with just one ball remaining. Chasing a target of 132, the Brave seemed destined for defeat, needing 26 runs from the last 11 balls with only two wickets in hand. However, a late-game surge from tailenders Craig Overton and Tymal Mills turned the tide unexpectedly. The thrilling conclusion came when Reece Topley, the last batsman, hit a four on his first ball to secure the win.</p>

          <p>Following what President Trump described as "highly productive" talks in Moscow between his special envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House has indicated openness to a summit. Media reports suggest a meeting between Trump and Putin could occur as early as next week, potentially followed by a trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This diplomatic activity unfolds as a US-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, with the administration stating that secondary sanctions on Russia's partners remain a possibility. Zelenskyy has expressed cautious support for peace efforts, emphasizing that Russia must end the war it initiated.</p>

          <p>The family of a man who died in the recent Air India crash has spoken about their added distress after discovering they were given the wrong remains. Arwen Greenlaw's brother and his husband were among the 242 people killed when the flight crashed in June. After a formal identification process in India, the family brought what they believed were his remains back to the UK, only for further testing to prove they belonged to two different individuals. The family is now seeking closure and accountability, highlighting a perceived lack of proper forensic protocols at the crash site.</p>

The prolonged closure led to significant travel chaos, with at least 10 flights canceled and more than 20 inbound flights diverted to other airports. Thousands of passengers faced long delays and frustration, with some holiday plans being entirely canceled moments before boarding.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, has been released from custody after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office dropped a felony weapons possession charge against him. The "Crank That" artist was arrested after police found a firearm in a vehicle he was a passenger in. The D.A.'s office declined to pursue the case due to insufficient evidence, as both the rapper and the driver denied ownership of the weapon.

While many on social media expressed outrage, the zoo and some experts defend the practice as a responsible way to mimic natural food chains and ensure the nutritional well-being of captive animals.

However, the US has extremely limited capacity for building such vessels, which are significantly more expensive than those made in South Korean or Chinese shipyards.

          <p>Shopify's stock surged 21% after the e-commerce software company reported second-quarter results that beat expectations and provided a strong forecast for the third quarter. The company's revenue grew 31% year-over-year, an acceleration from the previous year, and it projected continued strong growth. The upbeat report suggests Shopify is navigating the trade war better than feared, with its CFO stating that a potential negative impact from tariffs, which had been factored into guidance, ultimately "did not materialize." The company also saw a significant 29% increase in the total volume of merchandise sold on its platform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer plunged 18% after the company posted weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results and offered a disappointing outlook. The company's earnings and revenue both fell short of analysts' forecasts, with executives citing the impact of US tariffs and specification changes from a major customer. While Super Micro has benefited from the AI boom, its guidance for the upcoming quarter and full year also fell below Wall Street's more optimistic projections. This has raised concerns about slowing growth for the previously high-flying company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zoox, the self-driving vehicle subsidiary of Amazon, has received a key regulatory exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), paving the way for demonstrations of its robotaxis. This is the first time a US-built vehicle has been granted such an exemption, which frees it from certain federal safety standards designed for human-driven cars. As part of the decision, the NHTSA is also closing a safety probe into Zoox's self-certification of its purpose-built vehicle. The company plans to launch a commercial ride-hailing service, with Las Vegas eyed as its first market.</p>

          <p>President Trump has incorrectly described the timeline of 2024 jobs report revisions in his effort to justify firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner. Trump claimed the BLS released inflated job numbers just before the election and then revised them sharply down afterward, but the facts show a different story. A major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, two months before the election, while the final pre-election report in November showed a dramatic slowdown in hiring. The article suggests the President's claims of a politically motivated conspiracy are undermined by the actual release dates of the economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

The girl reported that the animal swam near her instructor before biting her, causing puncture wounds and bruising. This incident follows other recent aggressive sea lion encounters in California, some of which have been linked to a toxic algae bloom causing domoic acid poisoning in marine life. It is currently unclear if the sea lion in this latest attack was sick, but the girl plans to return to the water.</p>

          <p>The Library of Congress has attributed the recent removal of parts of the US Constitution from its official website to a "coding error." Internet users noticed that sections limiting congressional power, including the suspension of habeas corpus and the granting of titles of nobility, were missing from the digital text. The omission occurred sometime after President Trump fired the longtime Librarian of Congress in May. Despite the library's explanation and promise of a fix, the timing and the specific nature of the deleted clauses have led to public suspicion.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Mexican musician Ricardo Hernández, known as "El Makabelico," for his alleged association with the Cartel del Noreste (CDN). The U.S. Treasury Department accuses the popular hip-hop artist of laundering money for the cartel, which is designated as a terrorist organization, through his concerts and events. According to the administration, 50% of the rapper's streaming royalties go directly to the criminal group. This action is part of a broader US effort targeting Mexican musicians whose work explores themes related to cartels and who are suspected of having financial ties to them.</p>

          <p>The BBC has begun airing a new season of its popular cooking show "MasterChef," even though its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired last month following an investigation into their conduct. The BBC decided to broadcast the series, which was filmed before the firings, for the sake of the contestants, but the move has drawn backlash. The episodes appear to be edited to minimize the hosts' banter and jokes. Wallace was fired after numerous complaints were upheld against him, while Torode was let go over an alleged racist remark he has no recollection of making.</p>

          <p>The recent resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler presents President Trump with several strategic choices for filling the influential position on the central bank's board. One possibility is appointing a short-term "shadow chair" to serve as an agitator until a permanent successor to current Chair Jerome Powell can be named. Alternatively, Trump could select his long-term choice for chair now to fill the seat. The decision comes as Trump continues to criticize the Fed's policies and has stated he will only appoint governors who favor dramatic interest rate cuts, raising concerns about the central bank's political independence.

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled nearly $500 million in federal contracts for mRNA vaccine research. Kennedy justified the move by claiming the technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a view that contradicts the consensus of many public health officials. Numerous infectious disease and biosecurity experts have condemned the decision, warning it is based on flawed science and will leave the nation vulnerable to future pandemics and bioterrorism threats. This action reverses a key strategy from the first Trump term, which heavily funded the rapid development of life-saving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
