          <p>Israel conducted a series of airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency and warn of potential missile and drone attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would continue until the threat is removed, while Iranian state media reported fatalities in Tehran. The strikes led to a surge in oil prices and a drop in U.S. stock futures, fueled by fears of a broader regional conflict. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio clarified that the U.S. was not involved but was briefed beforehand, emphasizing the protection of American forces in the region. The White House convened a national security team to monitor the situation. Optimism score reflects the increased instability and potential for escalation in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran against the backdrop of U.S. efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Tehran. Trump stated that an Israeli strike could either "blow" or "help" the agreement, while also acknowledging that "something could happen soon" in the region. He emphasized that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, but did not confirm or deny the imminence of an Israeli attack. These remarks were made during an event at the White House, with Trump characterizing past discussions between American and Iranian negotiators as "very good".

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to address protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, deeming the move "illegal." The judge ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom, citing a failure to follow congressionally mandated procedures. The order is temporarily on hold pending appeal. The judge emphasized the protesters' First Amendment rights, stating that the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify federal intervention. The ruling underscores the ongoing tension between federal and state authority in handling civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, coinciding with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. Researchers from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs consumed human-cooked foods and waste. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The study, published in PNAS, highlights the early domestication process of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, in ancient China.</p>
