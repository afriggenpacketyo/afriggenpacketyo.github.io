          <p>A terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue on the holy day of Yom Kippur resulted in the deaths of two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, with three others seriously injured. The attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram into people before attempting to enter the building with a knife. He was shot and killed by police who arrived at the scene within minutes. The incident is being investigated as terrorism, with worshippers and security praised for their bravery in preventing the attacker from entering the synagogue.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the U.S. military conducted a strike in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, killing four individuals described as "narco-terrorists" aboard a vessel. The administration stated that intelligence confirmed the boat was transporting a substantial amount of narcotics destined for the United States. This is the fourth such strike in recent weeks and comes shortly after President Trump declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants, placing the U.S. in an "armed conflict" with them. The action has drawn condemnation from Venezuela, which described recent U.S. military activities in the region as a "provocation."</p>

          <p>The perpetrator of the Manchester synagogue attack, Jihad Al-Shamie, was a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent who was on police bail for a sexual assault allegation at the time of the killings. Al-Shamie, who was not on any counter-terrorism watchlists, was described by neighbors as a weightlifting enthusiast who kept to himself. His family released a statement condemning his actions and expressing sorrow for the victims. This article provides background on the attacker, noting he was granted citizenship as a minor and was not previously known to security services for extremism.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Ange Postecoglou reportedly still has the immediate support of the club's hierarchy despite failing to secure a victory in his first six matches. However, the upcoming Premier League game against Newcastle is being viewed as a potentially crucial fixture for his future. A section of fans expressed their frustration after a recent Europa League defeat, but the board is said to recognize mitigating circumstances, including controversial refereeing decisions. The performance against Newcastle, not just the result, will be significant in determining the club's confidence in the Australian manager heading into the international break.</p>

          <p>The United States federal government has officially shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The impasse centers on Democratic demands to extend expiring health insurance tax credits and reverse cuts to Medicaid, while Republicans push for a short-term funding bill without these provisions. The shutdown will furlough approximately 750,000 "non-essential" federal workers without pay and suspend many government services. Essential services like border protection and air traffic control will continue, but the closure could impact everything from national parks to research projects.</p>

A vice-president of the academy, which awards several of the prizes, specifically criticized the Trump administration's policies, stating they could have "devastating effects" on scientific research. The administration has proposed budget cuts for major research funders like the National Institutes of Health and promoted "patriotic education."

The victory was set up by a stellar performance from left-arm spinner Linsey Smith, who dismantled South Africa's top three batters early in the match. The performance serves as a decisive response to recent criticism following a poor showing in the T20 World Cup and a lopsided Ashes defeat. The commanding nature of the win provides a much-needed confidence boost for the team as they head into the next phase of the tournament.</p>

The author argues her strategic misjudgments, such as repealing the Climate Change Act and threatening to leave the ECHR, align the party with a fanatical right-wing agenda.

          <p>The core of the dispute causing the U.S. government shutdown is the fate of enhanced premium tax credits that help 22 million Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. These subsidies, which have nearly doubled ACA marketplace enrollment since 2021, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats are refusing to pass a government funding bill without an extension, warning that failure to act could cause premiums to more than double for the average enrollee. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people could lose their insurance coverage entirely if the credits expire.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that a federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., initiated by the Trump administration to combat violent crime, has resulted in a high number of immigration-related arrests. Of the more than 3,550 arrests made since the operation began, nearly 1,400 were administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for civil immigration violations. While the operation also led to arrests for homicide, narcotics, and firearms offenses, the data indicates a significant focus on immigration enforcement. The White House defended the operation, stating its goal is to address crime regardless of immigration status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary questions when top U.S. military leaders might push back against President Trump's increasing use of troops for domestic law enforcement, which potentially violates the Posse Comitatus Act. The author argues that recent deployments in U.S. cities, lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean, and rhetoric framing political opponents as an internal enemy are reshaping the military into a partisan tool. The article suggests that these actions, combined with the dismissal of senior officers, threaten the tradition of a non-political military. It calls for a defense of constitutional principles against this politicization.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Government Shutdowns Are a Uniquely American Political Phenomenon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 12:23:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While other Western democracies experience political polarization, the U.S. is an exception in its frequent government shutdowns, a recurring issue since 1976. This article explains that the phenomenon is rooted in the American political system's unique structure, including the significant budgetary power Congress holds relative to the executive branch. Unlike parliamentary systems where the ruling party typically controls the budget, the U.S. separation of powers allows for divided government and legislative gridlock. Furthermore, Senate rules like the 60-vote filibuster threshold and specific appropriation laws make it easier to derail the funding process compared to countries like the U.K.</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown is expected to exacerbate existing delays for student loan borrowers attempting to enroll in income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. According to court records, over a million borrowers are already in a backlog, many of whom are trying to switch out of the now-defunct SAVE plan and are seeing interest accrue on their loans. The Department of Education has stated that staff will be unable to process these applications during the shutdown. This halt could prevent borrowers from accessing more affordable payments and may delay their progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 74 advocacy and service groups has sent a letter to Congress warning that the Trump administration has frozen $88 million in funds designated to help survivors of human trafficking. The groups state that this failure to release funds jeopardizes the operations of over 100 organizations that provide essential services like safe housing and counseling. They argue that allowing these funds to disappear will "enable human trafficking and put survivors’ lives at risk."

In August, the average used EV was just $897 more expensive than a comparable gasoline car, and a flood of off-lease vehicles is expected to further increase supply and drive down prices. Analysts predict that 2026 will be "the year of the used EV," as affordability becomes a key driver for mainstream buyers.
