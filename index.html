        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham has drawn criticism from the UK Prime Minister and other political leaders. The ban was implemented by the local Safety Advisory Group, citing safety concerns and the "high risk" classification of the game by West Midlands Police, who referenced potential protests and previous violent incidents. Critics argue the move sends a shameful message and fails to combat antisemitism, while a local MP welcomed the decision due to unmanageable safety risks. The situation reflects broader tensions surrounding sporting events amid the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged two men in North Texas with terrorism-related offenses, alleging they were part of an "Antifa cell" that orchestrated a violent attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on July 4. The indictment claims the group planned to target law enforcement with gunfire and explosives, and that one officer was shot during the incident. The charges follow a presidential executive order labeling antifa a domestic terrorist organization, though defense attorneys argue that holding such beliefs is not a crime. This case highlights ongoing debates about the nature of antifa and domestic terrorism classifications.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former National Security Adviser John Bolton on charges of unlawfully transmitting and retaining classified documents. The indictment alleges that Bolton shared top-secret national defense information with unauthorized relatives through a personal email account and kept sensitive materials at his home. Prosecutors claim this information was later accessed by a hacker believed to be associated with Iran. The charges come as the Trump administration pursues legal action against several of the former president's political adversaries, though Bolton's attorneys maintain his innocence.</p>

A trailblazing journalist, she began her career at NPR's inception, hosting iconic programs like "All Things Considered" and "Weekend Edition" at a time when women were rarely given prominent roles in broadcasting. Colleagues remember her as a mentor and a storyteller who brought humanity to stories about culture, science, and politics. Her voice remains a permanent fixture at NPR's headquarters, announcing the floors in the building's elevators.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has maintained its block on President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops within the Chicago area, ruling that the administration has not justified the action under federal law. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" or that federal forces were unable to execute laws, which are the legal thresholds for such a deployment. The decision prevents the troops from operating inside Illinois but allows them to remain under federal control. The ruling is a setback for the administration's efforts to use the military to protect federal immigration facilities amid protests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new initiatives aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable and accessible for American families. The plan encourages employers to offer fertility benefit options, similar to dental or vision coverage, and includes a deal with drug manufacturer EMD Serono to lower the cost of a key fertility drug. President Trump framed the move as a way to help more couples have children, calling it a "pro-life" policy. While the effort aims to reduce the significant financial burden of IVF, it does not mandate employer participation, leaving the extent of its impact uncertain.</p>

The story served as a critique of the corporate, expansionist America of the Theodore Roosevelt era, reflecting fears of materialism and unchecked executive power.

          <p>More than 3,000 people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos, leading to cancer and other diseases. The lawsuit, estimated to be worth over £1 billion, claims that internal documents show the company knew about the contamination for decades but continued to sell the product. Johnson & Johnson, which has faced thousands of similar lawsuits in the U.S., has deferred comment to Kenvue, its former consumer health business, which maintains the product is safe and did not contain asbestos.</p>

          <p>Two children in Ohio, a 9-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, are facing serious charges including attempted murder, kidnapping, and multiple counts of sexual assault. The charges stem from a brutal attack on a 5-year-old girl in Cleveland that occurred in September. According to the victim's mother, the child was left unrecognizable with severe injuries all over her body. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the charges after reviewing evidence, though further details are being withheld due to the sensitive nature of the case and the ages of those involved.</p>

          <p>Fishermen in Venezuela are growing increasingly fearful for their safety following a series of U.S. military strikes on suspected "narco-boats" in the Caribbean. The U.S. has deployed a significant naval and air presence as part of an operation targeting drug trafficking networks allegedly linked to the Venezuelan government, resulting in at least 27 deaths. While the strikes occurred in international waters, local fishermen worry they could be mistakenly targeted. The escalating tensions have added a new layer of danger to their daily work, with some being urged by their families to abandon their profession altogether.</p>

          <p>Senator Mitch McConnell, 83, experienced a fall in a Capitol hallway on Thursday while on his way to a series of votes related to the ongoing government shutdown. The incident occurred as he was approached by two environmental activists. Although he appeared unsteady, McConnell was helped up by his security detail and continued walking, later participating in the scheduled votes. This is not the first such incident for the senator, who suffered a more serious fall in 2023 that led to a prolonged absence. McConnell has announced he will not seek reelection and will retire at the end of his term in January 2027.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to impose a new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B worker visas. The Chamber argues that the fee is unlawful and will make it prohibitively expensive for businesses, especially startups and smaller companies, to hire skilled foreign workers. The H-1B program is crucial for the technology sector, which relies on global talent to fill specialized roles. This legal challenge represents a significant pushback from the business community against the administration's broader efforts to restrict immigration and overhaul visa programs.</p>

The shutdown of its northernmost site was due to it no longer being in IDF-controlled territory.

The plan aims to significantly increase the size of the Bundeswehr by 2035 in response to the changed security landscape in Europe. As part of the proposal, all 18-year-old men would be required to complete a questionnaire about their interest and availability for service.
