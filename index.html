          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a significant trade agreement, establishing a 15% tariff on most South Korean imports, which is lower than the 25% originally threatened. The deal includes a $350 billion investment from Seoul into U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, although the two nations have differing interpretations on the control of these funds. Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products, while key agricultural markets such as rice and beef remain protected from further U.S. access. The agreement successfully averts a potential trade escalation ahead of a U.S. deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Boring Company, owned by Elon Musk, has proposed a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville, igniting a partisan conflict between state Republicans and local Democrats. The project, intended to connect the downtown area with the airport, is being advanced by Republican Governor Bill Lee as a privately funded venture at no cost to taxpayers. However, Democratic lawmakers in Nashville are raising alarms over the lack of public input, environmental assessments, and transparency, particularly concerning a plan to grant the company a no-cost lease on public land. The controversy highlights growing political tensions surrounding Musk's business ventures in Tennessee.</p>

The committee has rejected the possibility of granting immunity.

          <p>A jury has found Colorado dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela Craig, by lacing her protein shakes with arsenic and other poisons. Prosecutors argued that Craig was motivated by greed, including $4 million in life insurance policies, and a desire to pursue extramarital affairs. Evidence presented during the trial included Craig's suspicious internet search history, such as queries about undetectable poisons. Craig was also convicted on several solicitation charges for attempting to hire an inmate to kill the lead investigator and find false witnesses. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing analyst expectations. The decline was primarily driven by a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial chip division, which faced challenges from inventory adjustments and the impact of U.S. export restrictions related to China. Despite the profit slump, the company's overall revenue saw a slight increase. Samsung anticipates a recovery in the latter half of the year, banking on growing demand for AI-related products and a major new chip supply contract. (not investment advice)</p>

Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution, civil rights violations, and defamation, claiming he was unfairly targeted for political or professional gain. The dismissal was issued without prejudice, allowing Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile the case. This development follows the dismissal of the involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin last year after new evidence emerged. The case stems from the 2021 on-set incident where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand, Skims, has released a new product, the "Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap," which has quickly sold out while drawing significant criticism online. The wrap is marketed as a device to shape the jawline and is infused with collagen yarns, designed to be worn at home or overnight. Critics on social media have accused Kardashian of profiting from consumer insecurities and promoting unnecessary beauty standards, with some mocking the product's purpose. In contrast, some supporters have suggested it could offer benefits for individuals with jaw issues like TMJ, though the company has not made any medical claims.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the expensive and disruptive process of diverting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal, estimated to cost under £25 billion, would reduce risk and prevent spiraling costs associated with the airport's original plan. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the major infrastructure project, aiming to increase Heathrow's flight capacity significantly.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy reveals mixed economic impacts for the United States. While the new import taxes have significantly boosted government revenue, with the average tariff rate at its highest since 1934, they have not reduced the U.S. trade deficit as intended. In fact, the deficit has widened, partly because U.S. companies stockpiled foreign goods to avoid the tariffs. The policy has also shifted global trade patterns, with China reducing its exports to the U.S. while increasing trade with other nations. Economists warn that these tariffs are beginning to cause price increases for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become the most veteran player in the Los Angeles Rams' secondary, a role he is fully embracing. At 30 years old, Witherspoon is seen by the coaching staff as a savvy leader, with defensive coordinator Chris Shula referring to him as the "Yoda" of the position group. After a successful 2023 season, the Rams re-signed him to a one-year deal, a move he sees as a vote of confidence in the existing defensive unit. Witherspoon is focused on mentoring younger players and believes the combination of experience and aggression will make the defense special this year.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell after the company's first-quarter earnings report revealed that growth in its core smartphone royalty business was weaker than expected. While overall revenue was in line with forecasts, the slowdown in this key sector concerned investors. In a strategic shift, CEO Rene Haas also confirmed the company is exploring designing its own processors or chiplets to provide customers with a better starting point for development. This move could create execution risks and potentially turn some of Arm's largest customers, who design their own chips, into direct competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

The campaign, which uses patriotic themes, is funded by a recent congressional allocation of $76.5 billion to ICE over five years, aimed at expanding detention capacity and hiring 10,000 new staff. The goal is to support the Trump administration's plan for one million annual deportations.

          <p>At the request of President Trump, Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule. The proposed map could give the GOP up to 30 of the state's 38 House seats, potentially padding their majority in the 2026 midterm elections. This controversial mid-decade gerrymandering has prompted threats of retaliation from Democrats in states like California and Illinois, who are considering redrawing their own maps to favor their party. The move has ignited a national debate about political norms and the potential for a partisan gerrymandering war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 tremor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula resulted in surprisingly little tsunami damage to distant coastlines. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into a sparsely populated area of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii. This path allowed the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching more populated areas like the U.S. West Coast. While the event triggered extensive alerts, the specific location and directionality of the earthquake's rupture meant that regions like California were largely spared from destructive waves, representing a best-case scenario for a major quake.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, attributing the reluctance to a highly mixed and uncertain macroeconomic environment. He explained that while some indicators, like disappointing earnings from certain retailers, suggest a weakening economy that could warrant a cut, other factors like a strong labor market and persistent inflation create a strong case for holding firm. Cramer noted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is cautious about cutting rates prematurely and allowing inflation to resurge. This uncertainty leaves the market without a clear signal on future rate cuts.

The automaker's second-quarter revenue beat expectations, but its updated guidance reflects a total tariff hit of $3 billion, of which it believes it can offset $1 billion through mitigation efforts. The new forecast for adjusted earnings is lower than the pre-tariff range issued earlier this year.

          <p>A new wave of popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" is moving away from escapism and instead embracing anxiety-inducing, hyperrealistic storytelling. These series use techniques like real-time narratives and single-take sequences to immerse viewers in the high-stress, moment-to-moment pressures of their characters' work lives. This trend marks a shift from the comfort-focused shows that previously dominated, suggesting audiences are finding a cathartic satisfaction in watching realistic portrayals of mundane, high-stakes challenges. Psychologists suggest this vicarious stress can be engaging because it reflects the constant, low-level anxiety many people experience in their own lives.</p>
