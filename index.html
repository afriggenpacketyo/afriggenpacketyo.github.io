          <p>As his second administration nears its 100th day, President Trump is increasing pressure on Russia and Ukraine to resolve their conflict, even if it requires territorial concessions. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow, amid escalating tensions marked by recent Russian attacks on Kyiv following a lull during Easter. Trump publicly criticized Putin for the strikes, signaling growing impatience with Russia's actions, stating that the attacks were unnecessary and poorly timed. The situation remains fragile as the U.S. attempts to broker a lasting peace. (not investment advice)</p>

Although the program is optional, it requires individuals to provide personal information for verification, and the TSA will no longer accept non-compliant IDs.

While Amazon aims to keep prices low for shoppers, some third-party sellers will inevitably pass on the tariff costs to consumers.</p>

          <p>Amidst the economic turmoil of President Trump's second term, the term "stagflation" has resurfaced, indicating a combination of stagnation and inflation. Stock markets are signaling a recession, while bond markets anticipate inflation, reflecting a return to economic conditions not seen since the 1970s. Trump's tariffs are compared to self-inflicted oil shocks, potentially leading to higher prices, shortages, and job losses. The situation is further complicated by uncertainties surrounding trade policies and the potential for government intervention, making it difficult to escape the stagflationary environment.</p>

          <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko suggested that Ukraine may need to cede territory to Russia as part of a peace agreement, amid growing pressure from President Trump for territorial concessions. While acknowledging that it is unfair, he indicated it could be a "temporary" solution for peace, while stressing that Ukrainians would "never accept occupation". Klitschko made these remarks following a deadly Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv. He also noted that President Zelensky might be forced to take a "painful solution" to achieve peace.</p>
