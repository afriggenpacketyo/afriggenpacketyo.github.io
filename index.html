        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum, which houses treasures evacuated from mainland China, saw a record high of 6.14 million visitors in 2016, including 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. However, in 2024, only 50,000 visitors came from these regions, leading to a total of 2.87 million visitors for the year, with South Korea and Japan being the largest overseas groups. Despite this decline, the museum's director remains committed to reaching a target of 3.5 million visitors in 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryan Garcia's defeat by Rolando Romero has jeopardized a highly anticipated rematch with Devin Haney. Romero secured a unanimous decision victory over Garcia, who appeared sluggish after a year-long layoff. The article notes that Garcia was knocked down in the second round and struggled to regain momentum. Romero's win grants him the WBA welterweight title and potentially opens the door for a fight against Haney. Haney, who fought earlier on the card, won his fight but the loss of Garcia has made a rematch between the two fighters unlikely.</p>

          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, while campaigning for New Jersey governor, hinted at a potential third impeachment of President Trump if Republicans gain control after the 2026 midterms. Sherrill, who voted for both of Trump's previous impeachments, emphasized the importance of challenging tough fights and expressed concern over Trump's intentions to remain in office beyond two terms. She suggested that states could play a crucial role in blocking Trump's agenda and safeguarding the election system.

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar, which had exceeded its trading band against the US dollar due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes before the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected.

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to reduce government spending, modernize the state, and boost economic growth. Spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, the reforms involve merging ministries, closing state-run media outlets, and cutting approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes also include reducing the number of provinces and municipalities. Analysts suggest these reforms are intended to address dysfunction created by the anti-corruption campaign and to consolidate political power ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on car parts has been enacted in the US, adding pressure to an industry already dealing with policy changes. While President Trump eased the measure, the new tariff, along with a previous 25% import tax on cars, is meant to encourage domestic manufacturing. Analysts predict this will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers. General Motors anticipates up to $5 billion in new costs due to the tariffs. The article notes that Stellantis withdrew financial guidance for the year due to the uncertainty, and nearly half of the vehicles sold in the US last year were imported.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that approximately 58% of Japanese citizens believe that unverified information spread on social media during elections should be regulated by law. The survey comes amid concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes. The article mentions that 29% believe social media operators should regulate their platforms. The survey also touched on other constitutional matters, including divided opinions on revising Article 9, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions and cut thousands of jobs from other intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA), according to a report by the Washington Post. The reductions are expected to occur over several years, partly through reduced hiring. The CIA stated that the changes aim to align the agency with Trump's national security priorities. The article also notes that the Trump administration has eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coastlines face threats from rising sea levels, but new research suggests drought-induced water loss is causing parts of the country to rise. The land is lifting by about two millimeters each year due to reduced groundwater, which lessens the weight on the earth's surface. Despite the apparent buffer against rising seas, geoscientists warn against optimism, as the land uplift comes at the expense of water resources and could exacerbate drought conditions. The article notes that these insights could improve drought and flood monitoring and inform water resource planning.</p>

The German Foreign Ministry responded, stating that the decision was a result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect the constitution.

The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely following the implementation of the law to determine whether the measure has teeth. Of particular interest is how the law will impact the ability of firms to take local-level governments to court, and how it will protect the private sector from fines.</p>
