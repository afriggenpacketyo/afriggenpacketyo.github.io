          <p>A shooting in Manhattan's Times Square resulted in three people being injured early Saturday morning. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a restaurant involving a group of teenagers, which then escalated outside. A 17-year-old suspect was apprehended by the NYPD after a short pursuit and now faces multiple charges, including attempted murder. Police stated that one of the victims, a 19-year-old, was the intended target, while an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man were innocent bystanders.</p>

Her debut was at first base for a match between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she was welcomed with cheers from the crowd. After the game, Pawol donated her cap to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a market slowdown. Factors contributing to the decline include changing consumer habits, post-pandemic inflation, and the impact of global tariffs. An oversupply from production decisions made years ago is also driving down prices, leading to financial strain for distillers, with some smaller operations filing for bankruptcy. The article notes that while major brands may weather the storm, the current economic pressures are creating significant casualties and forcing the industry to innovate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its portfolio of patents derived from federal funding. In a letter, the Commerce Department accused Harvard of breaching legal requirements tied to its research programs and initiated a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous moves by the administration to freeze federal research money, citing alleged civil rights violations related to pro-Palestinian campus protests. Critics suggest these actions are a pretext to assert federal control over academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise health benefits like stress relief and relaxation is facing increased skepticism. While brands advertise ingredients like L-theanine and Lion's Mane mushroom, nutritionists and dietitians question whether the small amounts in these drinks are effective. An advertising watchdog recently banned one brand's ad for making unsubstantiated health claims. Some experts suggest any calming effect may be psychological, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself, rather than a direct result of the ingredients.</p>

Akbar reflects on the decline of his trade in the digital age, recalling a time when dozens of hawkers worked in the city.

While the plant's operator has installed a dedicated power line for the village, the final connection to individual homes is a government responsibility that has been delayed.

The parking company, Horizon Parking, sent demand letters threatening legal action before the error was identified.

          <p>Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona held a town hall in Iowa, criticizing the Republican-backed tax bill as a measure that would make "America poorer and sicker." His event was part of a broader Democratic offensive against the legislation, which they see as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections. Gallego argued the bill is a "clarifying moment" for Democrats to show they fight for the middle and working classes. His appearance in a competitive Iowa congressional district also fueled speculation about his potential national ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Chief Financial Officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town located 2,000 miles away. The CFO, Dawn Norton, claims she had informed Wilton's leadership of her intentions and was working remotely for the town while on family medical leave. However, Wilton officials state they were unaware she had accepted another full-time public office, which would have violated employment terms. The discovery came amid a review of Wilton's finance department over other issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with the destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics have raised concerns that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals, questioning the plan's feasibility.</p>

UEFA's post praised al-Obeid as a "talent who gave hope" but made no mention of how he died. In response, Salah posted on social media, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?"</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, suggesting people over 50 should eat more of the fruit to support healthy brain aging. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be expensive and is seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be a year-round alternative, though it advises consulting a doctor due to potential medication interactions.</p>

          <p>London police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. Protesters intentionally courted arrest by displaying signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action" to challenge the ban, which they argue illegally restricts free speech. The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice, Amnesty International called the mass arrests "deeply concerning" and disproportionate.</p>

          <p>The abrupt removal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after just two months in office reportedly stemmed from a conflict with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. The IRS had informed the Department of Homeland Security it could verify addresses for less than 3% of a list of 40,000 suspects and declined to hand over the information, citing taxpayer privacy laws. The incident highlights administration pressure on federal agencies to assist in its immigration crackdown, raising concerns about the politicization of government bodies.</p>
