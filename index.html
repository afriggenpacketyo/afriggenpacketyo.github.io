            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has strongly criticized opponents of the UK's net-zero carbon emissions target, accusing them of propagating 'nonsense and lies' to undermine the environmental agenda. Miliband asserted the government's commitment to doubling down on its green initiatives, emphasizing that transitioning to clean energy is crucial for social justice and national security, particularly after the energy market disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. He argued that reliance on fossil fuels leaves working families vulnerable to energy insecurity and economic instability. Miliband warned that abandoning net-zero would not only risk climate breakdown but also jeopardize future clean energy jobs.</p>

            <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing increasing scrutiny due to a series of espionage cases that have penetrated the island's political and military structures. Investigations and detentions of individuals closely associated with senior DPP politicians, including aides to Taiwanese leader Lai Ching-te, have raised concerns about classified information being leaked to mainland Chinese intelligence. These high-level breaches have fueled fears that Beijing's efforts to cultivate spy networks in Taiwan are intensifying, potentially undermining public trust in the administration and worsening cross-strait tensions. Beijing views Taiwan as a part of China to be reunified, by force if necessary.</p>

            <p>England is set to launch free breakfast clubs at 750 schools, offering free morning childcare to thousands of parents. The trial program, which will run until July, aims to provide up to 95 additional hours of childcare per year, potentially saving parents £450 annually. While the initiative has been welcomed by headteachers, concerns have been raised that the government funding may be insufficient to cover the costs. Teaching unions have emphasized the need for close monitoring to ensure that funding issues do not negatively impact other school provisions.</p>
