          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates while monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new White House report attributes the rise in chronic illnesses among children to factors like ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, and excessive prescription drug use. Led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the presidential commission's report suggests corporate influence and insufficient investment in understanding disease causes contribute to the problem. While the report diverges from standard government thinking, which primarily blames tobacco, poor nutrition, inactivity, and alcohol, it does not mention smoking or alcohol use. The report calls for further inquiry into the links between vaccines and chronic disease, and also suggests that sugar-sweetened beverages alone may be responsible for 1.2 million new cases of heart disease and 340,000 deaths worldwide.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, known as the 'Bagel Lady,' passed away at 87, leaving behind a legacy of transforming bagels into art and toys. In the early 1970s, she began painting smiling faces on bagels, turning them into necklaces and other creations. Her accidental bagel art career led to writing children's books and designing toys, including the popular Sweetie Pops dolls. Overcoming childhood illnesses, Blau found creative outlets in drawing and crafting, which later evolved into a successful career in art and toy design.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would restrict federal judges' ability to hold individuals in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for ignoring court orders. This provision, included in a tax and spending cut bill, aims to weaken federal judges by requiring a bond before enforcing contempt citations. Democrats argue this measure would undermine the judiciary's power and could retroactively affect ongoing cases involving the Trump administration's deportation policies. Representative Jim Jordan argues the provision targets cases involving nationwide injunctions, aiming to discourage frivolous lawsuits.</p>

Rodriguez, who shouted "Free Palestine" during his arrest, had legally purchased the firearm in Illinois and declared it when flying from Chicago.

An NHS England review into Calocane's care found major failings by the trust, and Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity SANE, said the BBC's findings show that had the trust learned lessons from previous cases, then Calocane's killings could have been prevented.</p>

While advocacy groups argued this split would improve corporate governance, Amazon urged shareholders to reject the proposal, stating the current policy allows the board to determine the right leadership structure for the company.

          <p>A semitruck carrying scrap metal overturned on an OR-126 on-ramp in Eugene, Oregon, spilling its contents onto Washington Street. The incident occurred just after 3:15 p.m., prompting the Eugene Springfield Fire Department to advise the public to avoid the area. No injuries were reported, but the crash caused significant traffic delays. Fire crews contained a hydraulic oil leak from the truck, and the Oregon Department of Transportation's TripCheck.com reported bumper-to-bumper traffic in the area.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit challenges the USDA's demand for sensitive data about millions of food stamp recipients, alleging violations of federal privacy laws. The USDA is requiring states to turn over data, including names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers, to comply with President Trump's executive order on eliminating information silos. Some states intend to comply, while others are weighing the legality of the request. Privacy experts warn this demand could set a dangerous precedent, allowing the federal government to create powerful surveillance tools.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem is shortly expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July. Analysts forecast a drop in the annual bill of Â£129, a fall of nearly 7%. The fall would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849. It would also more than reverse the Â£111 increase in a typical bill under the current price cap, which came into force at the start of April.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July, the first drop in a year. Analysts forecast a fall of more than Â£100 in the annual bill for a home using a typical amount of gas and electricity. Charities say cheaper bills would be welcome, but many people still struggle to pay, and millions of customers collectively owe about Â£4bn to suppliers. Although the cap changes every three months, the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.</p>
