          <p>A key security adviser in the UK is under scrutiny following the collapse of an espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. Conservatives suggest the adviser withheld crucial evidence, a claim the government denies, stating he was not involved in the case's substance. The controversy has sparked a political firestorm, with calls for an urgent explanation from ministers as to why the prosecution failed. This incident raises serious questions about the government's handling of national security threats and its approach to China.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's mayor has announced that the city will scrap all foreign investment limits on manufacturing facilities, marking a significant step towards greater market openness. The reforms aim to provide overseas companies in sectors like electric vehicles, biotechnology, and telecommunications full access to the Chinese market. As part of this initiative, the municipality will also ensure that foreign-funded manufacturers receive equal treatment in government purchasing and support in building their supply chains.</p>

          <p>An advice column explores the complex issue of whether fans can still enjoy the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's controversial views on transgender issues. The article argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist and that the books' core positive messages about rejecting discrimination can still be valued. It suggests that continued, critical engagement with the material, rather than outright rejection, allows fans to acknowledge flaws while still finding value and healing in the stories.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower complaint has triggered a state investigation into the corrections department of King County, Washington, for allegedly hiring unqualified immigrants as jail guards over several years. The complaint claims individuals were hired with temporary or expired work authorizations, violating state law which requires peace officers to be citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients. While the county denies hiring any illegal immigrants, it acknowledges a potential oversight and is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has called on the Trump administration to impeach "corrupt judges," a sentiment that has been supported by prominent MAGA figures. This endorsement comes amid an unprecedented increase in threats against the US judiciary, which experts see as part of a broader trend of employing authoritarian tactics to undermine democratic accountability. The article suggests these attacks aim to weaken judicial independence and intimidate judges into ruling in favor of the administration.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown ongoing, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are experiencing profound anxiety due to threats from the Trump administration of mass firings and the possibility of withheld back pay. Despite a 2019 law guaranteeing retroactive pay, recent presidential statements have created deep uncertainty. Union leaders state that these employees are being used as political pawns, facing significant financial and emotional distress as the political deadlock in Washington continues with no clear end in sight.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have employed an advanced AI protein language model to investigate convergent evolution, the process where unrelated species independently develop similar traits. The AI successfully identified complex, high-order structural similarities in proteins that traditional sequence-based methods would overlook. This technological breakthrough provides new insights into the genetic and molecular basis of adaptation, emphasizing an underrated mechanism for how different species evolve to meet similar environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is preventing the swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a newly elected Democratic representative from Arizona, effectively blocking her from casting a crucial vote. Grijalva's vote is the 218th signature needed on a bipartisan discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing unclassified government files related to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Johnson's delay is widely viewed as a partisan maneuver to shield the Trump administration from potential repercussions of the files' release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is deliberating on a challenge to a Colorado law that prohibits conversion therapy for minors, a practice widely discredited by major medical and mental health organizations. The case places the First Amendment free speech rights of a Christian counselor against the state's authority to regulate professional conduct to protect children from harm. The court's conservative justices appeared inclined to view the ban as a form of viewpoint discrimination, raising concerns about the future of such protective laws.</p>

          <p>The significant rally in Chinese stocks seen this year is now at risk due to the renewed threat of a trade war between Washington and Beijing. Following President Trump's warning of a "massive" 100% tariff on Chinese goods, a key index of Chinese companies listed in the U.S. plummeted by over 6%. This sharp decline highlights investor fears that an escalating conflict, centered on tariffs and China's export controls on rare earths, could quickly unravel recent market gains.
