          <p>A tragic collision in Gary, Indiana, resulted in the deaths of five people after their vehicle went around lowered crossing gates and into the path of a South Shore Line train. All five victims, who were members of the same family and in their early 20s, were pronounced dead at the scene. The train was carrying 32 passengers and four crew members, none of whom were injured in the incident. Officials emphasized the critical importance of obeying railroad crossing signals, noting that attempting to bypass them is not worth the risk. The National Transportation Safety Board is not investigating the crash.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 20 environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator. The suit alleges the Trump administration illegally terminated approximately $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that had been previously awarded. These grants were intended to fund local projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience in vulnerable communities across the nation. The plaintiffs, including groups like Air Alliance Houston, are seeking to restore the funding, arguing the cancellations violate administrative law and destabilize crucial community-led environmental initiatives.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" event, experts discussed the growing challenges to the U.S. dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency. Panelists noted that factors like U.S. economic policies, including widespread tariffs, and China's efforts to establish a yuan-centric financial sphere are eroding the dollar's standing. With the U.S. Dollar Index recently hitting a multi-year low, some analysts believe the yuan presents a more viable alternative than the euro. The discussion highlighted a significant potential shift in global economic power, driven by geopolitical tensions and the rise of alternative payment systems. (not investment advice)</p>

The new charges against Sun and her husband include wire fraud, bribery, and tax evasion.

Abrego Garcia is at the center of a convoluted legal case where he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, flown back to the U.S. on a judge's order, and then immediately jailed on federal smuggling charges. A 2019 ruling specifically barred his deportation to El Salvador due to fears of gang persecution.

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system, a significant milestone for the observatory. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn, orbiting a young star. Scientists used a specialized coronagraph to block the star's bright light, allowing the faint planet to be imaged directly. While there is a small possibility the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered planet, potentially offering new insights into planetary formation.</p>

          <p>A new survey from the American Farm Bureau Federation reveals that Californians will pay significantly more for their Fourth of July cookouts compared to the rest of the nation. A gathering for ten is estimated to cost over $90 in California, versus the national average of about $71. Staple items like ground beef, chicken, and even hamburger buns are considerably more expensive in the state. The report attributes the higher prices to several factors, including inflation, Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, and disruptions in the agricultural workforce, which impact production and supply chains.

          <p>The recent surge in shares of stablecoin issuer Circle highlights Wall Street's increasing interest in the technology, which experts believe could represent the next major evolution in global finance. As traditional financial institutions build more connections to digital asset infrastructure, the stablecoin market is projected to grow into a multi-trillion dollar industry. Companies like Fiserv and Mastercard are already integrating stablecoins into their networks, viewing them as a new money-movement platform with potential on the scale of the original credit card. This embrace of tokenization is creating new investment opportunities and preparing banks for a significant future market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice under the Trump administration has opened an investigation into the University of California system, alleging that its goals to increase faculty diversity may constitute illegal race- and sex-based discrimination. The probe focuses on UC's "2030 Capacity Plan," which aims to grow the student body while also increasing diversity among faculty and graduate students. The DOJ's civil rights division claims these goals may function as unlawful employment quotas, a charge the university denies, stating it is committed to fair and lawful hiring practices and will cooperate with the investigation.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old U.S. citizen, Andrea Velez, was arrested by federal agents during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles, an incident her family described as a "kidnapping." Witnesses and family members said agents grabbed Velez without asking for identification as she was being dropped off at work. Her family was unable to locate her for over a day until attorneys tracked her down. While authorities claim she was arrested for assaulting an officer, the incident adds to a growing number of reports of U.S. citizens being wrongfully detained in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>Carolyn McCarthy, a former Democratic congresswoman from New York who became a prominent national advocate for gun control, has died at 81. McCarthy's political career was born from tragedy after her husband was killed and her son was severely injured in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road mass shooting. She successfully ran for Congress in 1996 on a gun control platform after her Republican representative voted to repeal an assault weapons ban. Throughout her tenure, she was a fierce and passionate voice for stricter gun laws, channeling her personal grief into a public crusade.</p>
