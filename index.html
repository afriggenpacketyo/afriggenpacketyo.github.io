          <p>Two asylum hotel companies, Clearsprings and Mears, have committed to returning profits exceeding 5% to the Home Office, following scrutiny over contracts signed by the previous Conservative government. These contracts stipulated that Clearsprings, Mears, and Serco would reimburse profits above the 5% threshold, with a recent report indicating the firms collectively earned £383m since 2019 due to tripled housing costs for asylum seekers. Clearsprings indicated readiness to transfer £32m, while Mears expects to pay back £13.8m, pending Home Office audit. The Home Office aims to reduce hotel usage and save £4bn by the end of 2026 through increased asylum decision-making and removals.</p>

The company generates revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases made by its members using Chime debit and credit cards, competing with traditional banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. In the March quarter, Chime reported $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue, with a 32% revenue growth and 8.6 million active members. Chime also offers services like borrowing up to $500 with a fixed interest rate for eligible members, and roughly two-thirds of members consider Chime their primary financial relationship.

          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born student, after determining she was stopped in error. Despite the dismissal, Cristobal, who is in the U.S. without authorization, remains in ICE custody and faces deportation, along with her father who was also arrested following a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that their illegal status warrants deportation, while Cristobal's lawyers argue for her release and have scheduled a bond hearing. This case highlights the Trump administration's expanded focus on arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants, even those without criminal records.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market's recovery to pre-tariff levels, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding the final level of tariffs. The S&P 500 has rebounded since the start of the year, but investors are hesitant to fully commit, awaiting clearer signs of the economic impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, holding off on further interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs are known. This prolonged uncertainty is causing businesses to delay investments and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vaccine experts are expressing confusion and skepticism regarding the Trump administration's $500 million "Generation Gold Standard" project aimed at developing a universal flu vaccine. The project intends to create a flu shot that doesn't require annual updates and protects against potential pandemic-causing respiratory viruses, but it plans to use an antiquated approach involving injecting people with a whole killed flu virus. Experts argue that this method is outdated, produces more side effects, and overlooks more advanced technologies, and they are concerned about the large sum being invested in a single approach without independent review. The technology was developed by two NIH scientists, raising questions about transparency and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for as many as 9,000 Afghan refugees, potentially risking their deportation, is facing widespread condemnation as a betrayal. The administration claims Afghanistan's improved security and economy no longer warrant TPS, a contention disputed by Afghanistan watchers who fear for the safety of those who aided the U.S. military. This move contrasts sharply with the administration's promise to accept white South Africans, citing baseless claims of racial genocide against them, leading to accusations of racism and betrayal from veterans and immigration advocates. The immigration advocacy group CASA has sued the Trump administration over its termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroonians.</p>

Despite claiming $170 billion in savings, only $70.9 billion is itemized, and many entries raise doubts about their accuracy, with some experts estimating the real savings to be around $80 billion. CBS News identified a major error involving a $38.7 million contract for wastewater monitoring for COVID, which DOGE claimed to have canceled but was actually modified and extended.

The decision, prompted by an application from the Rose family following Pete Rose's death, alters MLB's policy that permanent ineligibility ends upon the death of the disciplined individual. Rose, known as Charlie Hustle, was banned for life for betting on baseball, while Jackson was banned for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. Despite their reinstatement, it remains to be seen whether they will be elected to the Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is set to headline a town hall in Iowa, fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Buttigieg, who served in President Biden's cabinet, has not ruled out a future run for office and emphasized the importance of assessing the needs of the office and his own capabilities. His visit to Iowa, a key early voting state, follows increased public appearances and media engagement since leaving the administration. While other Democrats are also making appearances in important voting states, Buttigieg's return to Iowa suggests a potential interest in future presidential aspirations.</p>

          <p>President Trump faces scrutiny for repeatedly promising not to cut Medicaid while House Republicans advance a bill proposing substantial reductions to the program. The bill aims to save $715 billion over the next decade by imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants, potentially leaving 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Despite his assurances, Trump has supported the "one, big beautiful bill," prompting criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, who accuse him of breaking his promises to protect Medicaid. The White House maintains that Trump is only targeting fraud and abuse within the program.</p>

          <p>GOP leaders are exploring cuts to federal aid, leaving some states fearful that their budgets cannot absorb billions of dollars in new costs. President Trump's proposed budget cuts to federal aid for major public services, such as infrastructure, education, and health care, are causing alarm among state leaders. Republican lawmakers are pushing for states to shoulder more of the financial burden, while Trump's administration aims to offset tax cuts. Governors warn that they may not be able to compensate for reduced federal funding, potentially leading to significant cuts in essential services and loss of health care coverage for many residents.</p>

The Israeli military leadership is exploring ways to restart aid deliveries while circumventing Hamas.
