          <h2>New York Yankees Pitcher Clarke Schmidt Likely Faces Season-Ending Surgery</h2>

          <p>The New York Yankees are facing another significant setback as starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt will likely require Tommy John surgery, which would sideline him for the rest of this season and all of the next. Schmidt has been a key part of the team's rotation, posting a 3.32 ERA and recently setting a franchise record for consecutive scoreless innings. This injury further destabilizes a struggling Yankees rotation and comes as the team has lost five consecutive games and fallen out of first place in the AL East. The team is reportedly calling up a pitcher from the minor leagues to fill his spot.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted raids in Southern California on the July 4th holiday, leading to the arrest of several immigrants. In West Hollywood, agents detained two longtime employees at a car wash, a move criticized by city officials as a "deeply troubling reminder of federal overreach." Another raid targeted a beloved food vendor in Eagle Rock, sparking community outrage and a successful fundraising effort for legal support. The ongoing enforcement actions have prompted protests, highlighting growing tensions over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The Fourth of July holiday across the United States was marred by numerous incidents of violence, including multiple mass shootings in cities like Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In Indianapolis, at least two people were killed and five were wounded, prompting the police chief to express frustration over unsupervised youths. The Gun Violence Archive has recorded over 205 mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year. The holiday also saw other tragedies, including a fatal firework accident and two separate boat explosions that caused severe injuries.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, an incident the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and U.S. officials attributed to Hamas. The attack occurred amid ongoing violence, with separate Israeli airstrikes killing at least 14 Palestinians. In a potentially positive development, Hamas has issued a "positive" response to a U.S.-led proposal for a 60-day truce, though it stated further negotiations on implementation are necessary. The events highlight the volatile security situation even as diplomatic efforts to halt the conflict intensify.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally paused a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, reportedly for the third time, citing concerns that U.S. weapons stockpiles are too low. The shipment, which included crucial air defense missiles, was promised during the previous administration to help Ukraine defend against intensified Russian attacks. Democratic lawmakers, like Rep. Adam Smith, have refuted the claim of low stockpiles, stating there is no evidence to justify the suspension. The decision has surprised and concerned both Ukrainian officials and European allies, who view the aid as vital for defense.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible target of 536 runs on the final day of the second Test against India, the England cricket team may be reconsidering its aggressive "Bazball" philosophy. For the first time since coach Brendon McCullum took over, the team is hinting at playing for a draw to preserve their 1-0 series lead. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick acknowledged that drawing the game is a possible and sensible outcome, a significant shift from the team's previous "win or lose" mantra. This strategic dilemma presents a major test for one of the defining principles of England's recent cricketing success.</p>

          <h2>AI Analysis Explains How Billionaires Pay Lower Effective Tax Rates Than the Middle Class</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry posed to the AI tool ChatGPT reveals that while the wealthiest Americans' nominal income tax rate is around 16%, their effective tax burden is lowered through strategies unavailable to the middle class. The AI explained that the core issue is how wealth is taxed differently than wages. Billionaires derive most of their income from appreciating assets like stocks, which are only taxed upon sale. They leverage this wealth using the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, taking out tax-free loans against their assets to fund their lifestyle, thereby avoiding the immediate taxation that wage earners face.

          <p>As Texas begins the grim task of recovering victims from the deadly flash floods, the focus is shifting to the disaster's cause and the official response. The storm, which killed at least 27 people, is being linked by some analysts to the broader climate crisis, which makes such extreme rainfall events more common. Officials have defended their actions, stating the intensity of the downpour was not predicted, which has renewed questions about the forecasting capabilities of the National Weather Service following recent budget cuts under the Trump administration. The search for the missing continues amid the devastation.</p>

          <p>The arrest of boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. by U.S. immigration agents has caused unease in his hometown of Culiacan, Mexico, the heart of the Sinaloa Cartel. Chávez Jr., son of the legendary boxer, was arrested for overstaying his visa and lying on a green card application. U.S. authorities also noted a Mexican warrant for his arrest on trafficking charges and suggested ties to the cartel, a topic locals are now hesitant to discuss due to recent internal cartel violence.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is under fire for sending an email that critics label as "blatant misinformation" regarding President Trump's new spending bill. The email claimed the bill "eliminates federal income taxes on social security benefits for most beneficiaries." However, the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction that phases out for higher earners, rather than a permanent elimination of the tax. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a partisan and misleading political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A year after Labour's significant 2024 election victory, many voters who supported the party are now expressing feelings of disappointment. In a focus group of voters from two Kent constituencies that swung to Labour, participants felt the government has not delivered on key promises, particularly on immigration. While some were forgiving, acknowledging the difficulty of "steadying the ship," others felt "lied to." The government's recent U-turns on policy have also been noticed, contributing to a sense that the party lacks clear direction, potentially creating an opening for rival parties like Reform UK.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his threats of retribution against political opponents, targeting figures like Elon Musk, New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and former officials. In the past week, Trump has suggested revoking Musk's subsidies and citizenship, and called for the arrest of Mamdani and former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Pro-democracy advocates warn that these actions represent a dangerous weaponization of state power intended to intimidate and silence critics. The threats are seen as an attack on the rule of law and freedom of speech.</p>
