          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, and Beatrice Folchi were arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist for three weeks in Woeltz's SoHo home. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was reportedly tied up and subjected to repeated electric shocks, cutting, and forced crack cocaine use. Court documents reveal evidence including photos of a gun pointed at the victim's head and the victim with a crack pipe. The suspects allegedly demanded the victim's Bitcoin password, and the victim escaped after agreeing to give it up, prompting a police response and the arrest of Woeltz, who is considered a flight risk. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico despite a U.S. immigration judge's order protecting him from being sent back to his home country. The man, who is gay, had previously presented evidence of being sexually assaulted and held for ransom in Mexico while seeking asylum in the U.S. Judge Brian Murphy stated that the deportation "lacked any semblance of due process." The Department of Homeland Security defended the deportation, claiming Mexico was a safe third option, but the judge refuted this argument, noting the man's documented experiences. </p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK railway management. The newly nationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, with the Department for Transport (DfT) Operator assuming responsibility for SWR trains. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander emphasized improvements to services and reinvestment of profits into infrastructure but refrained from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about potential outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservative opposition insists Labour must fulfill its promises.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, requiring journalists to be escorted in many areas, including the offices of Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hegseth, a former FOX News host, cited national security as the reason for the changes, aiming to protect classified information. The Pentagon Press Association condemned the move as an attack on the freedom of the press, while the National Press Club urged a swift reversal. The restrictions follow earlier measures by the White House to limit journalists' access and control news reporting.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if they gain power. This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has faced internal Labour divisions over both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. Starmer has already announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, while privately considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap amid growing unrest within his party.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author and activist known for her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, leading to significant legal and societal changes. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, with critics challenging her assertion that "all men" threatened "all women" with sexual violence. Despite later criticisms of her views on young women and sexual assault, her legacy remains significant in shaping the modern understanding of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>A power outage disrupted the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, prompting authorities to investigate possible arson. The outage, affecting 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area, was caused by a fire at an electrical substation and a collapsed high-voltage line. Despite the disruption, festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the closing ceremony, would proceed as planned, with the Palais des Festivals switching to an independent power supply. Authorities condemned the damage to electrical infrastructures and mobilized resources to find those responsible.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament in a move seen as a statement of sovereignty against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. This is the first time since 1977 that a British monarch has delivered Canada's throne speech, and it signifies a stronger support for the Crown. The invitation is a response to Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty and the imposition of tariffs that threatened its economic stability. While most Canadians are indifferent to the monarchy, the move is intended to emphasize Canada's distinct identity from the United States.</p>

Trump touted the elimination of critical race theory from military academies and claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, though data indicates the rebound began before his return to office.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his summer concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advise against performing due to exacerbated symptoms, and Joel is undergoing physical therapy, hoping to return to the stage. NPH involves cerebrospinal fluid buildup in the brain, leading to walking difficulties, cognitive issues, and urinary incontinence. While treatable with surgery to drain excess fluid, early diagnosis is crucial, and awareness from Joel's public disclosure may help others seek timely medical attention.</p>

          <p>Learners are struggling to afford driving lessons as costs rise, while instructors maintain pricing is fair due to increased expenses. Many learners need a license for work or family responsibilities, but high lesson costs are delaying their progress. A DVSA survey shows hourly lesson prices have increased, with the most common price bracket between Â£36 and Â£40. Instructors cite rising expenses such as car leases, fuel, and insurance as reasons for the higher prices. The practical test backlog is also forcing learners to take more lessons to maintain skills, adding to the financial burden.</p>

The trial exposed institutional failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to abuse with impunity for decades. The lack of a single, recognizable figure like in the Pelicot case and a virtual omertÃ  on child abuse are seen as contributing factors to the public's apathy.</p>

          <p>The murder of Andriy Portnov, a controversial former Ukrainian official, in Madrid has sparked shock but little sympathy, given his association with corruption and Russian influence. Portnov, who had a history of threatening journalists and exerting influence under former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, was shot dead after dropping his children off at school. While the motives for his murder may seem evident, his death has left unanswered questions, with speculation over whether Russian actors or other criminal groups were responsible. Portnov's career involved transforming the Ukrainian judicial system to serve the pro-Russian administration, leading to sanctions from the US.</p>
