        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Health is set to broaden access to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy for Caremark members, prioritizing it as the preferred GLP-1 obesity drug beginning in July. This partnership aims to offer Wegovy at a more affordable price, with negotiated savings potentially passed on to members through lower premiums or copays. CVS is also partnering with NovoCare, Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, to dispense Wegovy at a reduced price to cash-paying patients. The program will integrate lifestyle support, including personalized nutrition plans, to enhance weight management efforts. This move occurs as Novo Nordisk seeks to increase patient access following restrictions on compounding pharmacies producing cheaper Wegovy alternatives.</p>

          <p>McDonald's experienced a significant decline in U.S. same-store sales, the largest since the COVID-19 pandemic's onset, attributed to bad weather and cautious consumer spending among low- and middle-income demographics. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a decrease in quick-service restaurant traffic across income levels, with McDonald's particularly affected due to its customer base. The company plans to focus on value meals and popular menu items, like snack wraps and Minecraft-themed meals, to attract diners. Despite challenges in international markets, McDonald's is maintaining its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 new locations and invest in capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors has issued a recall for approximately 600,000 full-size trucks and SUVs in the U.S. due to potential engine failure caused by manufacturing defects in connecting rod or crankshaft components. The recall follows an investigation by the NHTSA after numerous complaints of engine failure in GM vehicles equipped with L87 V8 engines. The recall includes models from 2021-2024 such as Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, and GMC Sierra 1500.

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals agreement, granting Washington preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for establishing a reconstruction investment fund. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the economic partnership's role in accelerating Ukraine's recovery and facilitating an end to the war. The deal, pursued by President Trump, intends to monetize Ukraine's rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas, and other resources, compensating the U.S. for its wartime support. Ukrainian officials emphasized that Ukraine retains control over resource extraction decisions and that the fund will operate on a 50-50 basis, ensuring equal partnership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and avoid irreparable harm to small businesses. In a letter to key trade officials, the chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, proposed automatically lifting tariffs on small business importers and products not domestically available. The chamber also suggested a process for businesses to obtain tariff exclusions by demonstrating significant risks to U.S. employment. However, White House deputy chief of staff Steven Miller indicated the administration is not considering tariff exemptions, emphasizing tax relief for small businesses instead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisors highlight a relatively unknown 401(k) feature that can significantly increase retirement savings through after-tax contributions and subsequent Roth conversions. While the 2025 maximum 401(k) contribution is $70,000, which includes employee deferrals, after-tax contributions, company matches, profit sharing and other deposits, this strategy allows for additional savings beyond standard limits. However, only a small percentage of employer plans offer this option, and even fewer employees utilize it. Converting after-tax funds to Roth periodically is crucial to maximize tax-free growth and minimize future tax liabilities, with the best plans offering automatic Roth conversions.</p>

He criticized federal budgeting practices, comparing reform to steering a fleet of supertankers, and emphasized the need for greater political support to achieve significant spending cuts. Musk also discussed his presence in Washington, working from the White House and interacting with President Trump, while investigations into fraud uncovered by DOGE are underway.</p>

Mounjaro and Zepbound sales exceeded expectations, but shares fell after CVS Health prioritized Novo Nordisk's Wegovy over Zepbound.

A Harvard study spanning 75 years found that good relationships are the clearest predictor of well-being, while other studies suggest that spending less time alone and engaging in social activities contribute to happiness. Despite the negative associations of social media, connecting with others online can still boost happiness, with face-to-face conversations proving most effective.

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will be banned from competing in women's football starting June 1, prompting varied reactions. Supporters of the decision cite safety and fairness concerns, while LGBTQ+ advocates express disappointment and concern for transgender women who may now give up football. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling and has sparked debate about inclusivity and fairness in sports, with some calling for solidarity with the transgender community. Critics of the previous policy called the decision 'overdue' and 'nonsensical'.</p>

While Trump suggests tariffs could generate over $1 trillion in revenue, experts argue this is insufficient to replace income taxes, and the benefits of tariffs are more likely to benefit higher-income individuals. Economists warn that relying on tariffs to replace income taxes would disproportionately affect low- and middle-income Americans, who spend a larger share of their income on essential goods, and that higher prices could trigger a recession.</p>
