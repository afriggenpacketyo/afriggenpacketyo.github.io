        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it affirms that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The acquisition is expected to involve some headcount reductions as the two companies integrate their operations.</p>

          <p>American Express reports that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending increasing by 7% in the second quarter. This trend has largely shielded the company from concerns about a broader economic slowdown. However, a notable exception is in travel, where spending on airline tickets has stalled, specifically in the category of domestic economy airfare. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, investor concerns over the high cost of rewards programs and increased competition have caused the company's stock to dip.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lawyers representing a nurse involved in an employment tribunal have criticized NHS Fife for publishing an "irresponsible" statement during the ongoing case. The nurse had complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor, leading to the tribunal. The health board's public statement alleged the proceedings had incited threats against its staff, a claim that drew scrutiny from the judge and Scotland's information commissioner. The case centers on a confrontation that left the doctor feeling distressed, and the nurse was later cleared of gross misconduct by an internal hearing.</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein were told to "flag" any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and FBI, Durbin raised concerns about the handling of the Epstein records, suggesting the review process was rushed and involved personnel who lacked proper expertise. The senator's office stated it received information that this effort was haphazard and that personnel were specifically instructed to identify any records where the president was named, adding another layer to the ongoing political controversy.</p>

          <p>In response to increasing pressure, President Donald Trump announced he has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein case. The move follows a report about a letter allegedly signed by Trump in a birthday album for Epstein. While Bondi stated the Justice Department is prepared to petition the court, releasing such transcripts is legally difficult due to strict secrecy rules. Critics argue that this action is insufficient, calling for the release of other evidence like videos and witness interviews to provide a fuller picture.</p>

The report highlights that eleven different U.S. storms each caused at least a billion dollars in insured losses.

The risk is heightened because the ground is parched from a recent heatwave, which will cause heavy rainfall to run off quickly instead of being absorbed.

          <p>The annual royal tradition of "swan upping" on the River Thames has revealed a positive turn for the swan population, with numbers beginning to recover after a significant decline. The five-day census found 115 young swans, a notable increase from 86 last year, suggesting a reversal of a 45% drop over the past two years. The decline was attributed to avian flu and acts of human cruelty. While the tradition once served to count royal property, it now focuses on conservation, education, and monitoring the health of the iconic birds.</p>

          <p>A rare July weather system is creating unusual conditions in Southern California, bringing the potential for dry lightning, scattered showers, and an increased risk of wildfires this weekend. The National Weather Service reports that the system, fueled by a low-pressure area in Mexico, has already produced storms in Orange County and the Inland Empire. While some rain may fall, the primary concern is dry lightning strikes occurring outside of rain shafts, which could easily ignite dry vegetation. Officials are advising residents to remain vigilant and stay indoors if they hear thunder.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly escalating trade tensions by demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union. According to sources cited by the Financial Times, this represents a significant increase in his demands as negotiations over a trade framework appear to have stalled ahead of an August 1 deadline. The EU had been aiming for a deal more aligned with the U.K.'s, which maintained a 10% baseline tariff. The report triggered a drop in the stock market, reflecting investor anxiety over potential new trade disputes.</p>

          <p>A 54-year-old mother from Bradford, UK, has been sentenced to over 13 years in prison for orchestrating a drug smuggling operation that used her own children as couriers.

She was arrested while collecting her five children and daughter-in-law at Birmingham Airport, where they arrived with suitcases full of the drugs.

Attorneys for the organization argue the law, which targets abortion providers that received significant Medicaid funds, would harm vulnerable patients with limited healthcare access.

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that consumers' expectations for inflation have fallen to their lowest levels since before the latest round of tariffs was announced. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive future inflation risks, their immediate fears have receded. The overall consumer sentiment index also saw a slight increase, aligning with estimates and reaching its highest point since February, providing an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve.

Key questions revolve around the health and stability of their pitching staff, particularly the recovery of starters Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Blake Snell, and Tyler Glasnow. Another major focus is the workload and role of Shohei Ohtani as he returns to pitching, and whether his two-way demands will affect his performance.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. This article explains that while being on Social Security doesn't disqualify individuals from debt relief, the best strategies may differ from those for wage earners. Programs like debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, can be effective. Other options include negotiating directly with creditors through hardship programs or, in severe cases, debt settlement. The key is finding a solution that aligns with a fixed income without requiring new loans. (not investment advice)</p>

While both airlines have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, their emphasis on high-margin premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs positions them to better navigate a difficult year compared to their more price-sensitive competitors.</p>
