          <p>Over 500 law firms filed an amicus brief supporting Perkins Coie's lawsuit against a Trump administration executive order.  The brief argues the order, and similar ones, aim to intimidate law firms into submission, jeopardizing the rule of law.  The firms contend that the threat of retaliation for representing controversial clients creates a climate of fear.  Several prominent firms chose to avoid similar targeting through deals with the White House, highlighting the contentious nature of the situation.</p>
