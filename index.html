          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan committee is also seeking testimony from numerous former high-ranking Justice Department and FBI officials from the last four presidential administrations. The probe aims to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the Epstein case and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell over the years. Bill Clinton's past association with Epstein, including flights on his private plane, has been cited as a reason for the summons.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has revised its full-year production forecast downward after failing to meet second-quarter financial expectations. The company now anticipates producing 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, a slight reduction from its previous 20,000-unit goal, citing ongoing supply chain issues and a slower-than-expected ramp-up for its Gravity SUV. The reported quarterly loss of 24 cents per share and revenue of $259 million both fell short of Wall Street estimates. This news reflects broader challenges in the EV market, including softening demand and upcoming changes to federal tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that missed analyst expectations, causing its stock to decline in after-hours trading. While the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed forecasts, its adjusted earnings per share came in at 48 cents, just below the anticipated 49 cents. AMD is a key competitor to Nvidia in the booming AI chip market, and demand for its products remains strong, particularly in its data center and gaming segments. The company is also navigating U.S. export controls on certain AI chips destined for China, which impacted its gross margin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Snap's shares fell sharply after the company reported disappointing second-quarter financial results, specifically missing expectations for its global average revenue per user (ARPU). This key metric, which indicates advertising revenue generated from each user, came in at $2.87 against an expected $2.90. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker performance to a flawed advertising platform update, which has since been corrected, and other external factors. Despite this, the company provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of Wall Street estimates, suggesting potential for recovery in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that U.S. home prices are experiencing modest declines in certain regions, creating a divided national market. Cities in the South and West, such as Austin and Miami, are seeing the most significant price drops, driven by an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices. This regional variation highlights how housing supply is the primary factor influencing affordability and market dynamics for potential homebuyers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic examines the term "Russia hoax," a phrase frequently used by Donald Trump to describe the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It argues that despite Trump's persistent claims, the core findings of Russian meddling to aid his campaign are well-documented by U.S. intelligence and the Mueller report. The piece traces how the definition of the "hoax" has shifted over time and notes that while some sensational rumors were debunked, the fundamental evidence of interference remains. The author concludes that the "hoax" narrative itself is a political strategy to cast doubt on legitimate investigations.</p>

The comprehensive report states the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols and had a "toxic" safety culture that discouraged employees from raising concerns. Investigators found that the vessel's design was flawed and its structural integrity was likely compromised in prior incidents. The report assigns significant blame to CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, for ignoring warnings and creating an environment where safety was underemphasized.</p>

Using the current showdown in Texas as a prime example, it notes that such fights can now easily determine control of Congress. Historically a part of U.S. politics, the practice has escalated into a "blood sport" because a 2019 Supreme Court decision left no federal restrictions on redrawing districts for purely political gain. This has paved the way for aggressive, mid-decade redistricting efforts that have profound national implications for political power.</p>

While a top high-yield savings account might currently earn slightly more over three months, the difference is negligible. The key distinction is that a CD's rate is fixed and guaranteed, providing certainty in a period where interest rates are expected to fall. A savings account's rate is variable and could decrease, but it offers the crucial benefit of liquidity, as funds are locked away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 2,300 members of the Writers Guild of America, including prominent figures like Spike Lee and Adam McKay, have signed an open letter condemning what they call the Trump administration's "authoritarian assault" on free speech. The letter criticizes the administration for filing lawsuits against news organizations, threatening broadcasters' licenses, and defunding public media like PBS and NPR. The writers argue these actions are un-American attempts to silence criticism and control the types of stories that can be told.

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is underway in Texas as dozens of Democratic lawmakers have left the state to block a Republican-led vote on redrawing the state's electoral map. The proposed plan, encouraged by Donald Trump, could create up to five new Republican-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, a shift that could determine which party controls Congress after the 2026 midterms. The situation has national implications, with Democratic governors in states like California and New York threatening to pursue their own partisan redistricting in response, potentially setting off a nationwide political "arms race."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column analyzes the political challenges facing Kamala Harris amid speculation she may run for president again in 2028. The author argues that her biggest obstacle is not historical precedent but the current deep unpopularity of the Democratic Party, even among its own base. Harris is seen as a symbol of the party's recent loss and its perceived failure to effectively counter the Trump administration. To win, the party needs a candidate who can appeal to a broader electorate, but Harris's political style is viewed as tailored to a progressive base rather than the swing voters needed for a national victory.</p>

While investors remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, the recent slide and new debt offering have introduced some caution. Despite the recent volatility, Coinbase stock has still seen a substantial increase in value year-to-date, buoyed by its inclusion in the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines crucial questions for homeowners thinking about taking out a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current financial environment. With high interest rates on other forms of credit, using home equity can be an attractive option. Homeowners should consider the timing and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, as a HELOC's variable rate could make borrowing cheaper over time, though this is not guaranteed. It's also important to compare the flexibility of a HELOC with the rate stability of a fixed-rate home equity loan to determine the best fit for their financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>
