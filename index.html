        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Munich's renowned Oktoberfest beer festival was temporarily shut down by police due to a bomb threat. The threat was linked to an earlier house fire and explosion in the city's Lerchenau district, which authorities believe was deliberately set as part of a family dispute. The incident at the house resulted in one fatality and another injury, with explosive traps discovered on the premises. This connection prompted police to close the festival grounds as a precautionary measure while they conducted a thorough investigation into any potential links between the two locations and ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-6.9 earthquake has struck the central Philippines, resulting in at least 69 fatalities, with the death toll expected to climb as rescue operations continue. The quake's epicenter was near Bogo city in Cebu province, where it caused buildings to collapse and trapped an unknown number of residents. Rescue efforts are being hampered by damaged roads, bridges, and persistent rain. The shallow depth of the earthquake contributed to its destructive power, compounding the challenges for a region already recovering from a recent deadly tropical storm.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the People's Republic of China's 76th anniversary, Beijing has published a paper reasserting its position on Taiwan and rebuking Western nations. The document accuses the West of a "gross violation" of the global order. It specifically references the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China. The article highlights that this resolution effectively expelled the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek's government, which had relocated to Taiwan after the civil war.</p>

Chunk, weighing over 500kg, overcame a broken jaw sustained earlier in the year, an injury suspected to be from a fight with another bear. Park rangers at Alaska's Katmai National Park praised his resilience in adapting his fishing techniques to cope with the injury. He secured victory by receiving over 30,000 more votes than his rival, bear 856.</p>

They were recognized for their successful campaign to bring the issue of climate justice to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Their efforts, supported by human rights lawyer Julian Aguon, led to a landmark advisory opinion from the ICJ affirming that states have a legal obligation to address climate change.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to change how international laws, particularly Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted by UK courts. The goal is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers and foreign criminals from blocking their deportation by arguing they would face worse prison or healthcare conditions in their home countries. Starmer stated that while he does not want to dismantle human rights laws, their application must be updated to address the current challenges of mass migration. He emphasized that genuine refugees fleeing persecution should still be granted asylum.</p>

Preliminary testing suggests this formula is unlikely to offer an SPF greater than 21, and in some cases, it could be as low as four.

          <p>The United States government has officially entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a crucial spending bill. The impasse is primarily due to a disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare policy, specifically the extension of tax credits for health insurance and funding for Medicaid. Although Republicans control both houses of Congress, they lack the 60 votes required in the Senate to pass the legislation without Democratic support. The shutdown is expected to furlough approximately 800,000 federal workers and could cause widespread disruptions to government services, though essential operations will continue.

A key weakness of the plan is its lack of specific details, particularly regarding a potential pathway to a Palestinian state, an idea Netanyahu has publicly resisted despite his endorsement.

          <p>Luc Frieden, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, has stated that Russia has become a "permanent threat to European security" that must be taken seriously. His comments come as EU leaders prepare to discuss new defense measures, including a proposed "drone wall" along Europe's eastern border to intercept unauthorized drones. The discussion is prompted by a series of recent Russian airspace violations and drone incidents reported by several European nations, including Poland, Estonia, and Denmark. While Frieden does not believe Europe is currently at war with Russia, he emphasized the need to respond to Moscow's provocations.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the alliance's precarious relationship with the United States under a reelected Donald Trump. A primary challenge was managing Trump's threats to withdraw support from allies not meeting defense spending targets. Foreign policy experts have given Rutte generally positive marks for his diplomatic efforts, particularly in securing a renewed U.S. commitment at the NATO summit in The Hague. While his approach has been described as strategic and effective, he faces ongoing tests in maintaining alliance unity against external pressures from Russia.</p>

          <p>As of today, every General Practitioner (GP) practice in England is mandated to offer online appointment booking services throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. This government initiative aims to eliminate the frustrating "8am scramble" where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines. In addition to booking non-urgent appointments, the online systems will allow patients to submit questions and symptoms to request a callback. The government has invested an extra £1.1 billion to support this transition to a more modern, digital-first healthcare service.</p>

          <p>The shutdown of the U.S. federal government is set to cause significant disruption across the country, affecting everything from travel to national parks. Approximately 800,000 federal employees are expected to be placed on unpaid leave, creating financial hardship for many families. Air travel could see major delays as essential but unpaid air traffic controllers and TSA workers may call in sick, as occurred during the 2018-19 shutdown. Additionally, national parks and Smithsonian museums face closures or severely limited services, and the processing of passports and other federal documents will likely be delayed.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist went undercover as a cleaner for seven weeks at Castlehill, a care home in Inverness, Scotland, uncovering widespread instances of poor care and resident distress. The investigation was prompted by a family who used a secret camera to document neglect of their father. The undercover reporter witnessed understaffing that led to residents being left in soiled clothes, not receiving timely assistance, and a general lack of dignified care. The home, which charges up to £1,800 per week, had the most upheld complaints in Scotland in 2024, highlighting a systemic crisis in the care sector.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mohammed Abu Mughaisib, a medic with Médecins Sans Frontières who was recently evacuated from Gaza, has described the harrowing conditions faced by medical staff. He revealed that doctors are starving and sometimes forced to sip glucose solution for energy while treating malnourished patients, as food has become dangerously scarce. He depicted Gaza's hospitals as overwhelmed and smelling of blood, with patients lying on the floor and staff waiting for one patient to die to free up a bed for another. The doctor, who lost his home and was displaced numerous times, emphasized the immense difficulty of his decision to leave his colleagues behind.</p>

          <p>A civilian employee of the U.S. Department of the Navy has been charged after allegedly reporting a false active shooter at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. The report triggered a base-wide lockdown and a large-scale emergency response. According to the criminal complaint, the employee, Malika Brittingham, admitted to fabricating the threat. She allegedly explained to investigators that she orchestrated the hoax because she felt ostracized by her coworkers and hoped that enduring a shared crisis would help them "trauma bond."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of their wild-card series, powered by a dominant offensive performance that included five home runs. Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández each hit two homers, providing a comfortable lead for starting pitcher Blake Snell, who delivered a strong seven-inning outing. However, the team's bullpen showed signs of weakness, allowing three runs in the eighth inning and creating a tense situation. Despite the late-game disorder, the Dodgers held on for the win and are now one victory away from advancing to the division series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, prompting an ethics complaint. The nonprofit group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, alleging the message was a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities. The banner claimed Democrats were inflicting pain on Americans with a "$1.5 trillion wish list," while the Trump administration wanted to keep the government open. The incident raises questions about the politicization of government agencies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown means that all active-duty military service members will be required to continue performing their duties without receiving pay until a funding deal is reached. Essential civilian personnel within the Department of Defense will also continue to work, while other civilian employees will be furloughed. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown concludes, military pay is not guaranteed unless Congress passes separate legislation. In response, some financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA have announced plans to offer no-interest loans to affected service members.</p>
