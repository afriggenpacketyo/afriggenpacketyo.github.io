          <p>Former President Trump stated he believes the war in Ukraine would end if all NATO countries stopped purchasing oil from Russia. In a social media post, he shared a letter purportedly sent to NATO in which he declared his readiness to impose "major Sanctions on Russia" on the condition of a unified oil embargo by the alliance. He also advocated for significant tariffs on China for its purchases of Russian petroleum, arguing these measures would weaken Russia's negotiating position and help conclude the conflict.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has called on all NATO countries to stop purchasing Russian oil, stating he is prepared to impose "major sanctions" on Russia once they do so. In a letter, he also urged the alliance to place 50% to 100% tariffs on China for its role in buying Russian petroleum, suggesting these economic pressures would help end the war in Ukraine. This proposal comes amid heightened tensions, including recent Russian drone incursions into the airspace of NATO members Romania and Poland.</p>

          <p>In an effort to protect local wildlife, the canton of Fribourg in Switzerland has introduced a strict new hunting regulation. The measure imposes a two-year ban from hunting chamois rams on any hunter found guilty of a "wrongful kill," meaning they shot an animal that did not meet the specified age or gender criteria. This policy is intended to hold hunters more accountable and pressure them to exercise greater care, thereby ensuring the stability of the chamois population.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, but a clear motive remains elusive, fueling political speculation. While Utah's governor stated the suspect was indoctrinated with leftist ideology, reports also emerged that Robinson lived with a transgender partner, a community Kirk often criticized. This ambiguity has led to varied reactions, with some conservatives softening their rhetoric against the individual while continuing to blame broader liberal ideology for the political violence.</p>

          <p>A new memorandum of understanding between Hainan province and Hong Kong signals a new era of economic partnership rather than competition. The article argues that Hainan's development as a free trade port can complement Hong Kong's established role as a global financial hub. By leveraging Hong Kong's world-class financial infrastructure, legal services, and risk management, Hainan can attract and scale cross-border capital flows, creating a synergistic relationship that boosts the entire region's competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark legal battle for equitable funding for Maryland's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has passed away at 81. He was the driving force behind a 15-year lawsuit arguing that the state had systematically underfunded its four Black colleges while unfairly duplicating their programs at nearby white institutions. The case resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021, cementing his legacy as a transformative figure in higher education.</p>

          <p>On the television show "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg argued that the Democratic party mishandled concerns about former President Joe Biden's age and fitness for office. Goldberg contended that by making the issue a "public spectacle" instead of dealing with it "in-house," Democrats damaged their own standing with voters. Her comments came during a discussion about an excerpt from Kamala Harris's new book, in which Harris described Biden's decision to run for re-election as "reckless."</p>

          <p>According to leaked military planning documents, the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in the state's urban centers. The plan, which would supplement local police in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, has not been officially confirmed but is seen by critics as a political maneuver. This potential move aligns with the administration's focus on crime in cities, though it has raised concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling Morena party, Salvador Ramírez, has resigned after making controversial comments on a television program about the killing of Charlie Kirk. During the broadcast, Ramírez stated that Kirk, who he described as promoting weapons and being anti-rights, was given "a spoonful of his own chocolate." The remarks drew the attention of a U.S. State Department official, who warned against glorifying violence, leading to a public apology from the news network and Ramírez's subsequent resignation.</p>

          <p>A recent barrage of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City has killed at least 32 people, including 12 children, according to medical staff at Shifa Hospital. The intensified offensive comes as Israel urges Palestinians to evacuate the area, which it describes as the last major Hamas stronghold. Despite the evacuation orders, hundreds of thousands of people remain in the city, facing dire humanitarian conditions as the conflict continues and the death toll rises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination featured engravings with references to internet memes, video games, and anti-fascist songs. The messages included the emoticon "OwO," a code for a bomb in the game "Helldivers 2," and lyrics from the Italian anti-fascist anthem "Bella Ciao." Experts caution that these "extremely online" references are a form of doublespeak designed to be ambiguous and generate media attention, making it difficult to determine a clear political motive from them alone.</p>
