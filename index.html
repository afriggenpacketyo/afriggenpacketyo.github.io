        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has imposed significant new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, in an effort to pressure Moscow into negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. This marks a direct intervention by the Trump administration, which had previously been hesitant to target Russia's energy sector due to concerns about global economic impact. The move follows stalled diplomatic talks with President Vladimir Putin and aims to cut off a primary source of funding for Russia's military operations. The sanctions' effectiveness may depend on whether major buyers like China and India reduce their purchases of Russian oil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biographical film, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," chronicles the decades-long evasion of justice by the infamous Nazi doctor. Directed by Russian filmmaker Kirill Serebrennikov, the movie portrays Mengele's life in exile across South America after performing sadistic experiments at the Auschwitz death camp. The film, starring August Diehl, is based on a non-fiction book and explores the nature of evil and ideological extremism by closely following Mengele's perspective. It also highlights the network of collaborators who helped him and other Nazi war criminals escape accountability after World War II.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its counter-narcotics operations by conducting airstrikes on two boats in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of five individuals. These are the first such strikes on the Pacific side of South America, adding to a series of controversial attacks in the Caribbean that have killed at least 32 people and strained relations with Colombia and Venezuela. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated the alleged traffickers with terrorist groups, while Colombian President Gustavo Petro condemned the act as murder and a violation of international law. The administration justifies the strikes under a disputed legal theory involving designated terrorist organizations.</p>

The commission is chaired by President Xi Jinping, and this promotion solidifies Zhang's role within the top echelons of military leadership. The announcement coincides with news that Zhang Fengzhong, a senior general from the PLA's Rocket Force, is currently under a corruption investigation. These developments underscore the ongoing anti-graft campaign within China's armed forces.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is reviewing public statements made by Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik following the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky at age 29. For over a year, Kramnik had made unsubstantiated cheating allegations against Naroditsky, who denied them and stated they had taken a significant personal toll. The chess community, including top players, has condemned Kramnik's actions as harassment that damaged Naroditsky's reputation. The incident highlights rising toxicity and the challenge of addressing cheating accusations in the era of popular online chess.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, notably targeting the country's energy sector by banning imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG). The new measures are designed to weaken Russia's economy and its ability to finance the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attending an EU summit in Brussels, praised the sanctions as a crucial step to pressure Moscow. European Council President Antonio Costa reaffirmed the bloc's unwavering financial and military support for Ukraine, stating that leaders are not tired of aiding the country's fight for peace.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) has given Thames Water its lowest possible rating of one star for poor environmental performance in 2024, citing repeated sewage spills. The assessment revealed that eight out of nine English water and sewerage companies were rated as "requiring improvement" or worse, marking the sector's worst combined score since 2011. Serious pollution incidents across the industry increased by 60% compared to the previous year. While an industry body acknowledged shortcomings, Thames Water stated that its necessary transformation program will require at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service has issued a notice clarifying that the date on a postmark does not necessarily reflect the date an item was mailed, raising concerns for mail-in voters and others relying on deadlines. This discrepancy is due to operational changes from the USPS's reorganization plan, where mail from certain areas may not be processed until the day after collection. While USPS insists its process for applying postmarks hasn't changed, the logistical shift could disenfranchise voters whose ballots are postmarked after Election Day. To ensure a timely postmark, the agency advises customers to request a manual stamp in person at a post office.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have introduced the "Compact for Academic Excellence," a proposal that would require universities to commit to protecting free speech and viewpoint diversity to be eligible for federal research funding. The initiative aims to hold publicly funded institutions accountable for fostering open inquiry and prioritizing academic excellence over ideological activism. While some university leaders support the compact as a necessary reform to counter what they see as a drift towards ideological conformity, many elite institutions have denounced it, fearing it could lead to government interference in academic affairs.

Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa criticized both for acting "like two kids in a schoolyard" but failed to create a breakthrough moment.

          <p>The ongoing civil trial concerning the 2019 overdose death of Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs places a spotlight on Major League Baseball's 136-year history of substance use. From the 19th-century "elixir" made from animal testicles to 20th-century amphetamines, cocaine, and steroids, players have long sought chemical aids to manage pain, enhance focus, and prolong careers. The article argues that the pressure to constantly perform during a grueling 162-game season creates a culture where substance use becomes a tool for survival. Skaggs's death from fentanyl-laced pills represents a grim continuation of this legacy, where the substances intended to keep players on the field now pose fatal risks off it.</p>

          <p>The Baltimore Ravens, at 1-5, are facing a make-or-break point in their season, which has been derailed by a wave of injuries to key players, including quarterback Lamar Jackson. The team's offense has struggled without Jackson, while the defense ranks as one of the worst in the NFL, unable to stop the run or generate pressure. While the return of some injured players offers a glimmer of hope, the season-ending injury to defensive lineman Nnamdi Madubuike is a major blow. With a crucial game against the Chicago Bears approaching, a loss could effectively end any remaining playoff aspirations for a team that began the year with Super Bowl hopes.</p>

          <p>Sports ticket prices have more than doubled since 1999, driven by teams prioritizing higher revenue from fewer, more expensive seats over selling a larger volume of cheaper ones. This business strategy includes dynamic pricing based on demand and an increased focus on premium experiences, such as luxury club areas and exclusive seating. Many loyal, long-time fans are being priced out, as exemplified by Baltimore Orioles season ticket holders facing price hikes of over 35% for renewed packages.

          <p>A persistent shortage of smaller, affordable "starter homes" is preventing many first-time buyers from entering the housing market, even as bidding wars cool. For decades, the construction of such homes has declined, dropping from 40% of the market in the 1980s to just 12% in 2023. Factors contributing to this scarcity include rising material costs, which reduce profit margins for builders, and existing homeowners holding onto low mortgage rates, which limits the supply of available homes.

          <p>The Kremlin has maintained a conspicuous silence following President Trump's decision to impose sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies and cancel a planned summit with President Vladimir Putin. Trump expressed frustration that his conversations with Putin "don't go anywhere," marking a sharp turn from his previous diplomatic approach. While pro-Kremlin state media largely ignored Trump's criticism, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused the U.S. of embarking on a "warpath." The sanctions and canceled meeting represent a significant escalation in U.S. pressure on Moscow over the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a potential 2028 presidential contender, is scheduled to campaign in Virginia for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger. Shapiro's appearance is seen as a significant boost for Spanberger in the final stretch of a competitive race against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. Both Shapiro and Spanberger are considered moderate Democrats, and his support aims to energize voters in the key Hampton Roads area. The race has tightened recently, partly due to controversy surrounding the Democratic nominee for Attorney General, making high-profile endorsements crucial for both campaigns.</p>

          <p>Four survivors have withdrawn from the UK's national inquiry into child sexual exploitation by grooming gangs, stating they will only rejoin if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resigns. The women cited concerns about the inquiry's direction and felt publicly dismissed by Phillips after she characterized their accounts as "untrue" and "misinformation." Their departure adds to the turmoil surrounding the inquiry, which has also seen two potential chairs withdraw. The government has affirmed its support for Phillips, who has a background in supporting victims of sexual violence, while other survivors on the panel have expressed a desire to continue working from within.</p>

China's top leaders, concluding a key policy meeting, appear to view property risks as largely contained while emphasizing tech as a more urgent national priority. Real estate investment continued to fall sharply in the first three quarters of the year, dragging on overall economic growth, and home prices have continued to decline. However, the government's focus remains on advancing high-tech manufacturing and other strategic industries. (not investment advice)</p>

However, Gvardiol persevered, eventually breaking into the senior team and embarking on a successful career that led him to the Premier League. Now a key player for Manchester City, the 23-year-old Croatian international has become one of the highest-scoring defenders in the league since his arrival.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from its recent pledge to more aggressively intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A proposed new "maritime doctrine" to tow boats back to shore is now being described by some insiders as a "political stunt" that may never happen. The potential policy reversal is attributed partly to France's current political turmoil and raises concerns for the UK government's strategy to stop the crossings. Legal and safety issues, including the risk of fatalities and prosecution of security forces, are also cited as major obstacles to implementing more forceful interventions at sea.</p>
