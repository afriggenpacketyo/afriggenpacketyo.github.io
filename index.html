          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies, escalating a feud between the two. This action could cost Musk billions, impacting SpaceX and Tesla, which benefit from government programs like NASA contracts and electric car incentives. Musk responded by threatening to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft, although he later walked back on this statement. The potential loss of subsidies could significantly affect Tesla's revenue from regulatory credits and electric vehicle tax credits, as well as SpaceX's funding for space missions. </p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court reversed a district court's decision that held the executives liable for compensation after the earthquake and tsunami caused one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. The appeal trial focused on whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate, following a 2008 estimate that a significant tsunami could hit the plant. The acquittals of two executives in a related criminal suit were finalized earlier this year. </p>

          <p>This article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). More retailers and brands are offering simpler items, but nutritionists caution against sacrificing fortified nutrients for shorter ingredient lists. The article discusses the debate over whether all ultra-processed food is inherently bad and whether consumers are being misled. It also highlights how food brands are adapting to meet the demand for less processed products while justifying their higher prices. </p>

The plaintiffs allege that the insurers' cost estimator software and other practices led to inadequate coverage. The suits open a new front in the litigation spawned by the catastrophic fires. </p>

          <p>China has conducted tests on core components of quantum-based network technology during a space flight, marking a significant step towards building an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications. The tests involved a laser module and a phase encoding device on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket. The experiment aimed to assess the modules' robustness against the stresses of rocket ascent, such as vibration and radiation. This effort is part of China's broader strategy to develop quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) networks. </p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. In many states, the time kids spend in detention doesn't count toward their incarceration, adding months to their confinement. This practice raises concerns about due process and rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system. Policy experts argue that this "dead time" is a waste of resources and has a negative impact on young people. </p>
