          <p>Actor Steve Buscemi has revealed that his last name is commonly mispronounced, even by himself over the years. During a recent interview, he explained that while the traditional Italian way is 'Boo-shemi,' he grew up saying 'Bue-semi' and has now settled on a hybrid pronunciation. The topic arose from a running joke in his cameo on the series "The Studio," where characters struggled with how to say his name. This follows a similar revelation from Denzel Washington, who also shared that his name has been pronounced incorrectly throughout his career.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities, including ICE, detained 475 workers in a major raid at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia, targeting suspected unlawful employment. The majority of those detained were South Korean nationals, prompting a response from Seoul to ensure their rights are protected. The operation, described as the largest of its kind at a single site, is part of an ongoing investigation into illegal employment practices and has drawn criticism from labor groups who call it a politically motivated act of harassment. This raid highlights the administration's intensified crackdown on illegal immigration and its impact on major economic projects.</p>

Canada secured the top spot in Pool B with their victory in the compelling match held in Exeter. The final quarter-final matchups depend on the outcome of the game between England and Australia.</p>

A newly approved 13-person governance board, including former top aides and prominent Democratic fundraisers, will lead the project's fundraising and site selection. The team faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate, with costs for such projects often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The library is envisioned as a museum detailing his presidency and a center for civic engagement, leadership, and public service.</p>

          <p>An opinion article scrutinizes Melania Trump's recent White House event on artificial intelligence, where she positioned herself as a champion for responsibly integrating AI into children's lives. The author argues that while the first lady advocates for AI, her husband's administration is simultaneously cutting funding for established educational programs like Head Start and promoting censorship. The piece also criticizes the 'Take It Down Act,' which Melania Trump supported, suggesting it could be weaponized against free speech despite its aim to combat image-based sexual abuse. The author concludes that the administration's focus on AI may primarily enrich tech executives rather than genuinely improve education.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her first television interview since joining the court, asserted that its rulings are based on legal interpretation, not the personal values of the justices. Promoting her new book, she stated that the court's role is to interpret what the American people have decided through the democratic process, not to function as an "opinion poll." Her comments come as the court faces a request to reconsider the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, a right currently supported by a majority of Americans. Barrett emphasized the need for justices to tune out external criticism and focus on the law.</p>

After owning four properties, she and her husband sold them all, finding that renting offered greater financial gain and lifestyle flexibility. Joy argues that homeownership comes with significant hidden costs, such as maintenance and renovations, and being a landlord can be an emotional and time-consuming burden. By investing the proceeds from her home sales into index funds and focusing on her business, she claims her net worth grew faster than when she was a property owner.</p>

An émigré who fled the Nazis, Model captured the joy, pain, and wariness of jazz musicians and their audiences, but the project was abandoned due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. The collection features around 1,800 negatives, including portraits of legends like Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Billie Holiday.

It discusses how letting go of the constant worry about others' opinions can lead to a more honest and freeing existence. Psychologically, while humans are wired to seek approval for survival, most fears of judgment are overblown. The piece suggests that not caring is not about apathy, but rather a conscious decision to choose whose approval truly matters, framing indifference as a quiet act of defiance against external expectations.</p>

However, the incident reinforces Reform's core argument that the two main parties are indistinguishable and part of a broken system.

When Clackamas County Sheriff's deputies investigated, they found the man had been living there for an extended period, having set up a bed, lights, a television, and chargers by tapping into the house's power. The man was taken into custody on charges of burglary and unlawful possession of methamphetamine.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was fatally mauled by a suspected large shark while in the water off a popular Sydney beach. The man was with friends at Long Reef when the attack occurred, and despite being brought to shore by other surfers, his injuries were too severe for resuscitation attempts to be successful. Authorities have closed nearby beaches for at least 24 hours while they patrol the area for the shark. This incident marks the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 2022, a rare but tragic event for the ocean-loving community.</p>

          <p>A top Chinese space researcher has announced that the country is designing a mission to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid impacts. The mission, which officials hope to launch this year, will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away with a 'kinetic impactor' spacecraft. The goal is to slightly alter the asteroid's orbit by 3 to 5 centimeters, demonstrating the feasibility of such a defense strategy. If successful, China would become only the second nation, after the United States, to have demonstrated this planetary defense capability.</p>

          <p>One year after Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old American-Turkish woman, was killed by an Israeli sniper in the occupied West Bank, her family is still demanding an independent U.S. investigation. Eygi was volunteering with Palestinian communities when she was shot during a protest against settlement expansion. While an Israeli military probe concluded her death was unintentional, her family and a Turkish government investigation believe she was deliberately targeted. Despite repeated requests from the family, U.S. officials have not launched their own investigation, a response the family describes as a frustrating double standard in seeking justice for American citizens killed abroad.</p>

          <p>A recent National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. featured a speaker list that blended senior Republican figures and Trump administration officials with far-right publishers and Christian nationalists. This overlap raises questions about the distinction between the mainstream Republican party and more extreme nationalist movements. Speakers included a Missouri senator, a Trump-appointed assistant attorney general, and individuals associated with theocratic and white nationalist ideologies. Critics argue the event demonstrates that it is increasingly difficult to separate the far-right from the current administration, signaling a significant shift in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged to record levels, gaining approximately 35% this year as investors seek a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for individuals to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) rather than owning physical bullion, which incurs higher costs. These ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), offer liquidity and are more tax-efficient for a diversified portfolio. Advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to a small percentage of total investments due to its commodity-based price volatility (not investment advice).</p>

He used his computer skills to create a website documenting Eucharistic miracles, blending contemporary technology with deep, traditional devotion. His rapid path to sainthood reflects a church seeking to connect with younger generations by presenting a figure who is both relatable and devoutly countercultural.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the musical 'Hamilton' is being re-evaluated as its filmed version hits theaters for the first time. The article explores how the show, once intimately linked with the hope of the Obama era, feels different in the current political landscape. Initially celebrated by both liberals and conservatives, the musical later became a symbol of counter-Trump sentiment. Critics now more widely question its progressive portrayal of the founding fathers, and for some, its optimistic view of the American experiment feels dated. The show's enduring legacy is seen as a tragedy that questions how history is told and how quickly political dreams can fracture.</p>

Prosecutors stated that Jorge Garfias lured his former girlfriend, Yanelly Vargas, out of a bar, where he and his new girlfriend, Margarita Jimenez, brutally beat her. As Vargas fled, surveillance footage captured Jimenez pursuing her with a handgun and fatally shooting her in the chest. The motive was believed to be jealousy, and the couple now faces sentencing for the violent crime.</p>

Many are now struggling with food insecurity, as the former clinics provided essential nutritional support, which is critical for taking HIV medication.
