          <p>President Trump expressed significant frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin as strikes on Ukraine continued, despite ongoing White House efforts to broker a peace deal. Trump noted that every conversation with Putin was positive, yet bombings in Kyiv and other areas persisted, making him "very angry." He remained hopeful for peace, referencing Putin's visit to Alaska as a sign of willingness, and suggested he might act within weeks if a bilateral meeting doesn't occur. Meanwhile, both Russia and Ukraine reported extensive drone attacks, with US officials continuing discussions on future security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent further aggression.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly declined as investors reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating rhetoric on tariffs and his controversial move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index experienced significant losses, dropping 1.18%, with mainland China's CSI 300 also moving down. Trump reportedly threatened "200% tariffs or something" on China regarding rare-earth magnets and also targeted countries with digital taxes, creating broad market uncertainty. This financial news also covered the assessment of a new U.S.-South Korea trade deal, which included 15% tariffs on South Korean exports.</p>

          <h2>UK Food Inflation Reaches 18-Month High Driven by Soaring Chocolate and Egg Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 04:37:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK food inflation has reached an 18-month high of 4.2% in the year to August, primarily driven by significant increases in the cost of chocolate, butter, and eggs, according to the British Retail Consortium. Poor cocoa harvests, attributed to climate change and crop disease, have kept global cocoa prices exceptionally high, severely impacting chocolate costs for businesses. Retailers like Rumsey's Chocolaterie have seen chocolate prices treble and are forced to pass some costs onto customers or remove products from their menus. This surge in food prices contributes to the overall rise in UK inflation, which stood at 3.8% in July, prompting households to reassess their budgets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister François Bayrou is fighting for his political survival after opposition parties, from the National Rally to the Socialists, Greens, and France Unbowed, refused to support a confidence vote he called for September 8. Bayrou, leading a minority government, warned of a "worrying and decisive moment" for France due to its mounting budget deficit, which hit 5.8% of GDP last year. His proposed €44bn budget cuts have sparked widespread protests and caused France's CAC-40 share index to fall. With his government lacking sufficient support in the National Assembly, the outlook for his fragile administration appears bleak, potentially forcing President Macron to consider new elections.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's foreign policy is fostering closer cooperation with Japan, marked by his unprecedented choice of Japan for his first foreign visit since 1965. Analysts interpret this as a strategic alignment, particularly within the context of US-Japan-Korea collaboration, aimed at addressing the "China challenge." Zhan Debin of Shanghai University of International Business and Economics suggests Beijing should adopt a pragmatic view of Seoul's new government, given the focus on shared international challenges and interests. This diplomatic shift underscores evolving regional dynamics and the pursuit of unique insights into East Asian security.</p>

          <p>Australia has expelled Iran's ambassador and three other officials, giving them seven days to leave, after intelligence services linked Iran to antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned these "extraordinary and dangerous acts of aggression," stating they aimed to undermine social cohesion. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) uncovered links between the alleged crimes and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which reportedly used a complex network of proxies, including criminals, to direct the attacks. Australia has also withdrawn its diplomats from Tehran, suspended embassy operations, and plans to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization, marking the first ambassador expulsion since World War Two.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage documents as "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal." This dramatic move follows months of Trump's public attacks against the central bank over its handling of interest rates, which he believes are too high. Cook, appointed by Joe Biden in 2022 and the first Black woman in the role, has firmly stated she will not resign, asserting Trump lacks the legal authority to fire her "for cause" and her attorneys plan to challenge the action. The situation sets up a significant legal and political test of the Fed's independence, with potential market implications.</p>

The E3 nations demand Iran resume negotiations with the U.S. and grant UN inspectors access to its sites, among other conditions.

The campaign, which starts on the Elizabeth line and will expand to other services from autumn, seeks to foster a more considerate and stress-free environment for all commuters.

Bayrou's proposed €44 billion budget cuts are aimed at reducing France's 5.8% GDP deficit from 2024.

The evacuations come amidst heavy monsoon rains battering both South Asian countries, with Pakistan having already recorded over 800 flood-related deaths since June.

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its carbon market to include major industries by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, signaling a strong determination to meet its climate targets. New guidelines from top policymakers also call for setting absolute limits on emissions, a tougher standard compared to the current system that caps based on carbon intensity. This expansion, which will initially include the steel, aluminum, and cement industries this year, is expected to significantly spur demand in the often-sluggish carbon market.

Evergrande's $300 billion debt default triggered a sector-wide liquidity crisis, with new home prices falling and real-estate investments deepening. While analysts expect the drag on China's GDP to ease from 2.5 percentage points in 2022 to 0.3 percentage points by 2027, the market adjustment isn't over.

          <p>Venus Williams, at 45 years old, delivered a spirited and impressive performance in her US Open first-round defeat to Karolina Muchova, suggesting her illustrious tennis career may still have more mileage. Battling Sjogren's syndrome and fibroids, Williams expressed profound gratitude for feeling significantly better on court compared to a previous, pain-ridden encounter. Despite her loss, her high level of play against the 11th seed defied doubters who questioned her wildcard entry after a year of inactivity. Williams' performance, marked by powerful serves and attacking shots, reaffirmed her status as an icon who continues to inspire a generation, though her future tournament plans remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Long-elusive Mexican cartel kingpin Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to drug trafficking charges, expressing remorse for his role in flooding the U.S. with illicit substances and fueling deadly violence in Mexico. Zambada, 75, admitted the Sinaloa cartel, which he co-led with Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, trafficked at least 1.5 million kilograms of cocaine and bribed Mexican police and military commanders to operate freely. His arrest last year, at the end of the Biden administration, sparked deadly cartel infighting in Sinaloa. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the plea as a "landmark victory," ensuring Zambada will spend the rest of his life in a federal prison.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have announced a breakthrough in invisibility technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their powerful radar emissions exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. Traditionally, AEW&C aircraft are considered indispensable yet vulnerable high-value targets due to their strong radar signals. The new method utilizes frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, which assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, causing the signal to appear chaotic and obscuring its directional origin to adversaries. This innovation is described by engineers as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, significantly enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these critical command nodes in future conflicts.</p>

Trump asserted that the U.S. has leverage, citing Boeing parts for Chinese planes as a countermeasure, claiming 200 Chinese planes were grounded due to a lack of these parts. China dominates global rare-earth magnet production, controlling about 90% of the supply, giving Beijing significant leverage in trade talks due to U.S. reliance on these magnets for manufacturing. This threat comes despite a recent recovery in China's rare-earth magnet exports to the U.S. and ongoing high-level trade negotiations.</p>
