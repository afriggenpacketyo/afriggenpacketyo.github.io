          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for accountability from former Conservative ministers regarding a significant data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK resettlement. The breach, which occurred in February 2022, was concealed by a super-injunction that has since been lifted, revealing a secret and costly emergency resettlement scheme. The incident has raised serious constitutional questions and fears for the safety of hundreds of Afghans and their families who remain in Afghanistan, while the Ministry of Defence plans to challenge potential compensation claims.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes on Syria's Defense Ministry headquarters in Damascus, escalating its involvement in the region. The strikes come amid fierce clashes in southern Syria between government forces and armed Druze groups, with Israel stating its actions are in support of the Druze minority. The United States has expressed significant concern over the Israeli attacks, urging a halt to the fighting which threatens efforts to stabilize the new Syrian government. The conflict has resulted in hundreds of casualties and created a dire humanitarian situation for civilians caught in the crossfire.</p>

          <h2>Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu Receives Additional Prison Sentence</h2>

          <p>Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent political opponent of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been sentenced to a year and eight months in prison for insulting a prosecutor. This conviction adds to his existing legal troubles, including a prior sentence and pre-trial detention on separate corruption charges, which his party claims are politically motivated. These legal challenges are widely seen as part of a broader government effort to sideline opposition figures and could prevent Imamoglu from participating in future elections. The case highlights the increasing pressure on political dissent within Turkey.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official has indicated that President Donald Trump will likely fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell soon, following a meeting where Republican lawmakers reportedly supported the move. This development comes amid ongoing criticism from the Trump administration aimed at pressuring the central bank to lower interest rates. While the legality of such a firing is contested, with Powell himself stating it's "not permitted under the law," the report suggests Trump has already drafted a letter for the dismissal. The situation creates significant uncertainty for the independence of the U.S. central bank and financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review Concludes UK Counter-Terrorism Program Missed Chance to Intervene with Southport Killer</h2>

          <p>A major review has found that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism scheme missed a significant opportunity to intervene with Axel Rudakubana, who went on to murder three young girls in Southport. Lord David Anderson KC's report noted that teachers had referred Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, but his case was closed because he lacked a specific terrorist ideology. The review calls for Prevent to focus on individuals fascinated with extreme violence, regardless of ideological motive, and to improve its monitoring of online activity. The report also highlighted earlier failings in the handling of the man who murdered MP Sir David Amess.</p>

          <p>Debra Crew, the chief executive of the global beverage giant Diageo, has stepped down from her role with immediate effect and without a succession plan in place. The company, which owns brands like Guinness, Smirnoff, and Johnnie Walker, announced the departure was by mutual agreement. The move comes as Diageo faces declining sales for many of its brands, even as its flagship Guinness stout has seen a surge in popularity. Chief Financial Officer Nik Jhangiani will serve as the interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement for the outgoing leader.</p>

The bill, known as a rescissions package, is part of a broader Trump administration campaign to slash federal spending and is being fast-tracked to meet a legal deadline. While Democrats have warned the cuts will pave the way for deeper reductions in essential services, some Republicans have also expressed concern, successfully lobbying to preserve funding for the PEPFAR global HIV/AIDS program.

          <p>Irish country music singer Lisa McHugh has announced she is taking a break from her career after being diagnosed with functional neurological disorder (FND). The 36-year-old shared that she spent a difficult period in the hospital undergoing numerous tests before receiving the diagnosis, which affects the nervous system and can be triggered by stress and trauma. McHugh, who also suffered from trigeminal neuralgia earlier in the year, said she needs to focus on her recovery, which has involved re-learning to walk.

          <p>Severe flash flooding has caused significant travel disruption in New York City after heavy rainfall inundated the region, prompting a state of emergency declaration.

While the subway system was largely operational by the next day, some roads remained closed and officials warned residents in low-lying areas to remain vigilant. The UK Foreign Office has not issued a formal warning against travel, so cancellations for upcoming trips will depend on individual provider policies.</p>

          <p>The use of Terminal Island in Los Angeles as a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids has outraged local Japanese American activists. For them, the island is not just a port but the historic site of a vibrant fishing village that was home to their ancestors before they were forcibly removed and incarcerated during World War II. Activists see a painful parallel between the past injustice and the current deportation campaign, as the same location is once again linked to the mass detention of an immigrant community. They are protesting ICE's presence and calling for the agency to be banished from the historically significant site.</p>

Health officials attribute the surge in this highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage falling below the 95% threshold required for community immunity.

Initial analysis suggests the knight, who was around 40 years old at his death, was buried in the 13th or 14th century.
