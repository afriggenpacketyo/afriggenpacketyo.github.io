          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler won his first British Open championship, finishing four strokes ahead of the competition at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. This victory marks his fourth major title and his second of the 2025 season, further cementing his status as the world's number one player. With this win, Scheffler joins an elite group including Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as one of the few to win The Open, the Masters, and the PGA Championship before turning 30. He now needs only a U.S. Open victory to complete the career Grand Slam.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 85 Palestinians were killed Sunday while attempting to access humanitarian aid across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The deadliest incident occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses said Israeli forces fired on a massive crowd surrounding a UN food convoy, though the IDF stated they fired warning shots to remove a threat. The violence has prompted renewed alarm, especially as Israel issues new evacuation orders for central Gaza, a key area for aid distribution. The ongoing war, now in its 21st month, has created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with much of the population displaced and facing starvation.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas announced a significant decrease in the number of people unaccounted for following devastating floods in the Hill Country, with the list dropping from over 100 to just three. The historic flooding killed at least 135 people, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. Authorities attributed the sharp reduction to extensive follow-up work verifying the safety of many individuals initially reported missing. In response to the tragedy, which included the deaths of 27 campers and counselors at a youth camp, Texas lawmakers are set to review flood response and consider improving early warning systems.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project was destined for trouble due to fundamental national challenges, according to insiders involved in its planning and execution. The project, now tens of billions over budget and years behind schedule, suffered from an ambition to build the world's fastest railway on a small, densely populated island. This led to a very straight, and therefore disruptive, route. The UK's complex planning and legal systems, which allow for extensive local opposition and petitions, further drove up costs and caused significant delays, raising questions about the country's ability to execute large-scale infrastructure projects effectively.</p>

The subsequent trial against the miners collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to answer questions that have persisted for 40 years, bringing hope for justice to former miners and their communities who have long campaigned for the truth.</p>

The report highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros who returned from the U.S. to expand their family business, Mal de Amor.

While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his ability to convert leads into victories and his undisputed world number one ranking have made him the clear benchmark for his competitors.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs. The article argues that when children's feelings are dismissed, even with good intentions, it can erode their self-trust and lead to insecurity and anxiety. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence. The author suggests parents can build this skill through small shifts, such as validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self, and modeling their own emotional awareness and regulation.</p>

The family had intended to take the dog with them but was prevented by an airline policy regarding the animal's size. The dog was left at a Los Angeles County animal care center, which has seen an increase in pet surrenders due to deportations. Draco's story went viral on social media, and he has since been adopted by a new family, highlighting a lesser-known consequence of immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit aiming to prove that affordable and homeless housing can be built profitably without taxpayer money. With a $300 million investment fund, the initiative seeks to attract for-profit developers by providing upfront capital, simplifying financing, and cutting construction time and costs. Better Angels is currently bidding on several large projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to build hundreds of units faster and cheaper than typical affordable developments. While the rents will be higher than subsidized housing, the goal is to create a new, scalable model to address the housing crisis by letting "capitalism work."</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metallic necklace he was wearing. The incident occurred at a medical facility on Long Island, New York, when the man entered the MRI room without permission. The powerful magnetic field of the machine drew him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." The victim's wife stated he was wearing a 20-pound chain used for weight training and that she had called him into the room to help her after her scan. This tragic event underscores the critical safety protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects near MRI machines.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze says that online abuse directed at players is worsening as women's football grows in popularity. Her comments follow teammate Jess Carter's revelation that she received racist messages during Euro 2025, prompting a police investigation. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football is increasingly targeted online. The Lionesses squad held meetings to discuss the issue and will stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to combat racism. Bronze called for more accountability from social media platforms, emphasizing that players' voices are powerful tools for change.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to stay in his role despite his ruling coalition failing to secure a majority in the upper house election. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito fell short of their target, a result of public discontent over inflation, political scandals, and rising anti-immigration sentiment. This loss leaves the coalition in the minority in both houses of parliament for the first time since 1955. Despite the setback, Ishiba cited the need to lead critical trade negotiations with the U.S. as his reason for not resigning, a departure from the usual precedent following such a defeat.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to establish a new water ombudsman to handle consumer complaints about issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and sewage discharges. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public criticism for rising bills and environmental pollution. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog, which will have legal powers to protect customers, aims to bring the water industry in line with other utilities by providing a single, powerful point of contact for disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China produced mixed outcomes, with progress in some areas but little in others. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the trip, some Australian media and opposition figures were critical, suggesting China was trying to create a divide between Australia and the U.S. The article argues that Albanese's efforts to attract Chinese investment were undermined by his own government's actions, particularly regarding the potential sale of the Port of Darwin. This creates a perception of unreliability for potential Chinese investors, sabotaging the goal of strengthening economic ties.</p>

She criticized the tactics of federal agents, including the use of masks and unmarked cars, which she says resemble kidnappings. Bass also argued that the deployment of federal troops to the city was an unnecessary political stunt that misused taxpayer money, as local law enforcement had already managed the protests.</p>
