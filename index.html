          <p>The US House of Representatives is in an overnight session, preparing for a crucial final vote on President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, a defining piece of legislation for his second term. The expansive bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces considerable opposition from Democrats and a significant number of Republicans who are concerned about its projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit over the next decade. Key sticking points include proposed cuts to Medicaid, potentially impacting millions of low-income Americans, and changes to state and local tax deductions. This article details the intense political wrangling and the president's efforts to unify his party to secure passage by the July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>Leading Chinese brokerages forecast stagnation for yuan-denominated stocks in the second half of the year, attributing this outlook to a lack of new market catalysts. Persistent deflationary trends and subdued earnings growth are expected to continue weighing on the market, preventing significant valuation expansion despite ample liquidity and falling borrowing costs. The benchmark CSI 300 Index saw little movement in the first half, as investors awaited clearer policy signals and observed US trade talks. This article highlights a cautious sentiment among mainland analysts, contrasting with more optimistic projections for Hong Kong stocks, which are seen benefiting from Federal Reserve rate cuts.

          <p>The US House of Representatives has voted to advance President Donald Trumpâ€™s $3.3 trillion agenda bill, overcoming earlier threats of a Republican rebellion.
