          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack addressed the U.S. economic outlook, discussing the potential for future interest rate cuts in light of persistent inflation. Her comments on CNBC followed stronger-than-expected economic data, which has led investors to temper their expectations for rapid monetary easing from the central bank. While the Fed recently approved a quarter-point rate cut and signaled more could follow, the robust data suggests a more cautious approach may be warranted moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was unsuccessful in its bid to win mayoral offices in three major cities during runoff elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Candidates from the center-left SPD and center-right CDU defeated their AfD opponents in Gelsenkirchen, Duisburg, and Hagen. However, preliminary results show the AfD nearly tripled its share of votes in local councils to 14.5%, making it the third-strongest party in the region and indicating its growing influence despite the mayoral losses.</p>

The move escalated tensions that were already high, with the Indian team having also declined to shake hands with their opponents throughout the tournament. This incident, which officials called a "departure from tradition," occurred in the context of a recent military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.</p>

          <p>New archaeological research suggests that the mysterious collapse of the ancient Sanxingdui civilization in southwestern China may have been caused by an internal conflict. According to a leading scholar, a war for control of the capital likely led to a population exodus and the destruction of key infrastructure. Evidence cited includes the demolition of city walls, alteration of the urban water system, and the disappearance of religious sites, offering a new theory on the demise of this cornerstone of early Chinese civilization.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Bualoi has made landfall in Vietnam, bringing winds of over 130 kilometers per hour that have killed at least 11 people and left a dozen fishermen missing. The powerful storm triggered extensive flooding and damage, ripping roofs from buildings and downing power lines along the coast. In response, the Vietnamese government mobilized military personnel, evacuated over 53,000 residents to temporary shelters, and closed four airports as a precautionary measure before the storm hit.</p>

          <p>This opinion article offers a scathing critique of Kamala Harris's new election memoir, "107 Days," asserting that it reveals a politician fundamentally disconnected from the electorate. The author argues the book shows Harris was overly focused on the spectacle of campaigning and celebrity endorsements rather than substantive policy, displaying a lack of self-awareness about her and her party's political failures. The piece concludes that the memoir inadvertently explains why her presidential campaign was unsuccessful and suggests the Democratic establishment has failed to learn critical lessons.</p>

          <p>In a first-person account, BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy details a recent attempt by a criminal hacking group to recruit him as an insider threat. The group, known as Medusa, contacted him via an encrypted app and offered him a percentage of a multi-million dollar ransom payment in exchange for his BBC login credentials. The article provides a rare look into the tactics used by such gangs, including their methods of persuasion and the aggressive pressure they apply, such as bombarding a target's phone with security notifications.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police is consulting on a proposal to require its officers and staff to declare membership in the Freemasons. This potential policy change follows a recommendation from the independent panel investigating the unsolved 1987 murder of Daniel Morgan, which found that police membership in the secretive fraternity had been a recurring source of suspicion and mistrust. The force acknowledged that concerns have been raised about how such associations could impact impartiality in investigations, promotions, and misconduct cases.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, the former mayor of Kherson, Volodymyr Mykolaienko, details his harrowing experience of being held captive by Russia for over three years.

          <p>Investment bank Goldman Sachs has forecasted that China's central bank is likely to cut interest rates and ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter of the year. This prediction comes as the country's economic momentum slows and policymakers face increasing pressure to provide support for growth. The forecast suggests a potential 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, though analysts note the decision will be data-dependent.
