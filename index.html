          <p>A gunman killed three people and injured three others in the parking area of the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada. The suspect, identified as 26-year-old Dakota Hawver, fired approximately 80 rounds from a handgun before being shot by responding police officers. He is currently hospitalized in critical condition. Authorities have stated there is no known connection between the shooter and the victims, and the investigation is being led by the Sparks Police Department due to the involvement of Reno officers in the shooting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime position on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The confirmation passed nearly on party lines, with Democrats and two Republicans opposing it due to whistleblower allegations that Bove previously advocated for defying court orders related to immigration. Further accusations claim Bove misled Congress about his role in dropping corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams, which he has denied, creating a contentious appointment.</p>

          <p>Google has transformed its Android operating system into a massive earthquake detection network, using the accelerometers in billions of phones. When multiple phones in an area detect the initial, subtle P-waves of an earthquake, the system sends an early warning to users who may soon experience the more destructive S-waves. This can provide a crucial 15 to 60-second warning, which has already been effective in alerting people to thousands of real earthquakes since 2021. iPhone users can access similar alerts through third-party apps.</p>

          <p>A 56-year-old man in the UK, Tim Hull, has chosen to stop taking life-saving medication for his kidneys due to his exhaustion from battling the National Health Service for adequate care. Hull, who suffers from a rare neurological condition that has left him bed-bound, faced years of delays, misdiagnoses, and failures to provide appropriate equipment for his 6'10" frame. His family states he felt abandoned by the system, and ironically, only received more coordinated support from a local hospice after making his end-of-life decision.</p>

As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will fund Jewish community groups and a campus initiative to combat antisemitism.

Animal rights groups have condemned the action as "avoidable and illegal," filing a criminal complaint and arguing the zoo's own breeding policies were irresponsible.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 "endangerment finding," the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. This move could dismantle federal climate regulations but may also create an opening for California to strengthen its own environmental rules. Experts suggest that if the EPA cedes its authority to regulate these emissions, the power could revert to the states. California, which has a long history of pioneering aggressive climate policies, plans to continue its work regardless of the federal reversal.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to build up to 40,000 new homes over the next decade on disused railway land, such as former goods yards and industrial sites. The plan, part of a "brownfield first" development approach, will be managed by a new company called Platform4 and aims to attract private investment. However, critics note that the initial five-year target of 15,000 homes is a small fraction of the government's overall housing promise and that the construction industry already faces significant hurdles, including planning delays and regulatory backlogs.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that air travel is becoming bumpier due to climate change, which is altering atmospheric conditions. A warmer atmosphere intensifies thunderstorms, a source of convective turbulence, and strengthens the jet stream, which creates more clear-air turbulence. One study projects a potential doubling or tripling of severe turbulence in the coming decades, particularly over routes like the North Atlantic. While aircraft are built to withstand these forces, the trend could lead to more injuries, higher costs for airlines, and increased anxiety for passengers.</p>
