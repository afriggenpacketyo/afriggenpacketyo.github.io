          <p>Erin Patterson, an Australian woman, received a life sentence with a 33-year non-parole period for fatally poisoning three relatives and attempting to murder another using death cap mushrooms. Justice Christopher Beale highlighted Patterson's profound betrayal of trust, noting the victims' long-standing kindness towards her and her children. Ian Wilkinson, the surviving victim, expressed gratitude to the police and encouraged kindness, while the judge stated that Patterson had also intended to kill her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, had he attended the lunch. Patterson maintained her innocence, claiming the mushroom poisonings were accidental, but the judge inferred her intention to kill was ongoing.</p>

          <p>David Baltimore, Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former Caltech president, passed away at 87, leaving behind a legacy of groundbreaking contributions to virology, immunology, and genetic engineering. Baltimore's research on reverse transcriptase revolutionized the understanding of how viruses modify cells, leading to advances in AIDS treatment and cancer research. Beyond his scientific achievements, he was a prominent voice in ethical debates surrounding genetic engineering, advocating for responsible innovation and public discussion. Caltech President Thomas Rosenbaum praised Baltimore's profound influence as a mentor, colleague, and leader, emphasizing his commitment to defining ethical boundaries for biological advances.</p>

Owen had cited his Premier League goal-scoring record and Ballon d'Or win as evidence of his superiority at that age. Rooney, who looked up to Owen, emphasized the honor of playing alongside him for England and Manchester United. While Owen's career was hampered by injuries, Rooney enjoyed a longer and more successful career, winning the Champions League and multiple Premier League titles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large cocaine seizure in Ireland revealed the challenges law enforcement faces in combating transatlantic drug trafficking, with cartels increasingly using at-sea drop-off methods to circumvent port security. The Maritime Analysis Operations Centre reports that numerous suspected drug-trafficking ships were not intercepted due to limited resources. Ireland, with its extensive coastline and open border with the UK, is particularly vulnerable, facing inadequate naval and air support to patrol its waters. Despite a record cocaine seizure involving the Kinahan organized crime group, authorities acknowledge that the relentless traffickers and their vast resources pose a significant threat.</p>

          <p>An independent review led by Baroness Harriet Harman KC has uncovered systemic sexual harassment and bullying within the legal profession, particularly affecting pupil barristers. The review, prompted by increasing reports of inappropriate behavior, found that many trainees fear reporting misconduct due to potential career repercussions. Instances of groping, unwanted propositions, and verbal abuse were shared with the review, highlighting a power dynamic that discourages junior barristers from speaking out. While some measures have been taken, the review emphasizes the need for more substantial changes to protect future victims and uphold the integrity of the Bar.</p>

Humid conditions are expected due to rising dew points, and large surf will affect east-facing shores.

          <p>Shabana Mahmood, the new Home Secretary, is immediately confronted with a surge in migrant arrivals, with over 1,000 people reaching the UK in small boats on her first full day.

Mahmood is set to host a Five Eyes meeting to discuss tackling people smuggling, while the government considers expanding the use of military sites for asylum seeker housing.

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 33% in August, while overall exports growth slowed to 4.4%, marking the weakest level in six months.

Despite relying on alternative markets, the U.S. remains China's largest single-country trading partner. The trade talks between Beijing and Washington appear to be struggling, with limited progress made during a recent visit by a top Chinese trade negotiator. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint China-US study analyzing seismic waves from marsquakes has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, despite expectations that it should not. The team, using data from NASA's retired InSight lander, found the core to be approximately 600km in radius, about 18% of Mars' radius. This finding could revive the idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. The discovery suggests that Mars, Earth, and the moon all possess solid inner cores, challenging previous assumptions about planetary cooling and core formation.</p>

          <p>Following a large immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor facility in Georgia, President Trump has called on foreign companies investing in the United States to respect the nation's immigration laws. Trump emphasized the importance of hiring and training American workers, while also welcoming foreign investment and technical expertise. He stated that the US would make it easier for foreign companies to legally bring in their skilled workers, provided they contribute to the training and employment of American citizens. The raid, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, has strained relations between the US and South Korea.</p>

          <p>France's parliament is poised to remove another prime minister, François Bayrou, after just nine months in office, amidst a deep political deadlock. Bayrou initiated a confidence vote to address the country's looming debt crisis, but lacks the necessary support. The situation stems from President Macron's decision to call a snap parliamentary election in 2024, which resulted in a divided parliament. With the political mood drifting towards the right, the country faces challenges in finding a path towards a functioning government.</p>
