          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has advised his players to be true to their emotions as they grieve the death of teammate Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash along with his brother. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt and planned several tributes, including a minute's silence at their next match. Slot emphasized that the team will carry Jota's memory with them, encouraging an atmosphere where players can laugh or cry as they process the tragedy. The incident occurred in Spain when a tire blowout caused the player's car to leave the road.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has died after an incident in the River Kelvin in Glasgow, with his body recovered late at night by emergency services. The tragedy occurred on what was Scotland's hottest day in two years, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in some areas. In a separate incident on the same day, a 63-year-old woman died after falling near a waterfall in East Dunbartonshire. Police have stated that neither of the deaths is being treated as suspicious, and they occurred as many people flocked to outdoor beauty spots to escape the heat.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to resolutely defend its interests and prepare countermeasures against a threat from Donald Trump to impose 30% tariffs on most EU imports. This call for readiness contrasts with other European leaders from Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, who have urged for calm and a pragmatic, negotiated solution. The threat is viewed by many as a dangerous negotiating tactic during a time of global instability, creating division among EU members on the appropriate response. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's largest natural uranium project, located in the Ordos basin of Inner Mongolia, has successfully produced its first barrel of uranium, according to the China National Nuclear Corporation. Launched a year ago, the project is being touted as a breakthrough in environmentally friendly and efficient uranium extraction. State media described the new mining approach as a "green, safe, intelligent and efficient" method that avoids traditional tunnels and toxic waste. This development is expected to significantly enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium sector.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the five years since the murder of George Floyd, arguing that the initial wave of corporate and political gestures toward racial justice has not led to fundamental change. The authors contend that demands for systemic transformation were met with symbolic actions, while police budgets increased and authoritarian tactics expanded. They assert that the fight against police brutality and for community-based solutions continues, driven by grassroots organizing in the face of what they describe as an expanding American fascism. The piece calls for sustained, revolutionary work to build a society rooted in care rather than control.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a landmark 2023 civil rights settlement that was designed to address a decades-long raw sewage crisis in Lowndes County, Alabama. The Justice Department voided the agreement, which mandated the state to fix failing sanitation systems in the poor, majority-Black county, by labeling it an illegal Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiative. This decision reverses a federal mandate to resolve a severe public health issue where many residents live with raw sewage near their homes.

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in the Hill Country, this article examines Texas's historical pattern of underfunding disaster prevention while spending heavily on recovery. Despite being the most disaster-prone state in the US, facing everything from hurricanes to wildfires, its political leadership has consistently resisted proactive measures, such as improving emergency alert systems or reinforcing the power grid. Experts attribute this to a political culture favoring small government and influenced by the fossil fuel industry, which is skeptical of climate change. This reactive approach continues to leave communities vulnerable to increasingly frequent and intense weather events.</p>

While top players like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have expressed a desire to compete, MLB has yet to agree, citing logistical challenges and control over its own World Baseball Classic. LA28 organizers argue that including MLB players would be a massive global marketing opportunity for the sport.

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are developing "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into living jellyfish, allowing them to be remotely controlled for environmental data collection. These cyborg jellyfish can be dispatched to gather information on ocean temperature and pressure at a fraction of the cost of conventional underwater robots. Jellyfish are ideal for this purpose as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and can heal quickly. The project aims to make ocean research more accessible and scalable, potentially transforming how scientists monitor the world's oceans.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on LeBron James's future with the Lakers, noting he is entering the final year of his contract without an extension for the first time in his career. The author draws a parallel to Kobe Bryant, who, in a similar situation, announced his retirement early and embarked on a celebrated farewell tour. This allowed Bryant to control his own narrative and receive an outpouring of appreciation from fans nationwide. The article suggests that James could learn from Bryant's example, considering a similar pre-announced retirement to shape his legacy and give the Lakers a clear path forward.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To address its severe housing and homelessness crises, California is creating its first-ever state agency dedicated exclusively to these issues. The new Cabinet-level department is the result of a government reorganization plan proposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Supporters hope the move will elevate housing on the state's agenda and streamline the complex and fragmented system for financing affordable housing projects. While critics question if a bureaucratic reshuffle will create real change, advocates see it as a crucial first step toward bringing more focus and efficiency to one of California's most pressing problems.</p>

          <p>Economists report that the job market for recent college graduates in 2025 is one of the most challenging in the last decade, excluding the pandemic era. With fewer people quitting jobs and employers being cautious about hiring due to economic uncertainty, there are limited opportunities for new entrants. Many graduates are struggling to find work in their desired fields and are often settling for lower salaries than they anticipated. This trend is compounded by job cuts in sectors like government and tech, forcing many to be more flexible and consider roles outside their initial career plans.</p>

While the government insists it cannot improve the pay offer, the BMA has expressed hope for constructive discussions. Public support for the strikes has reportedly fallen significantly since the last industrial action in 2023.</p>

          <p>Tehran has officially confirmed that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian was injured during an Israeli airstrike that targeted a high-level security meeting in June. According to a report from a state-affiliated news agency, Pezeshkian sustained a leg injury and had to escape through an emergency hatch after six missiles struck the building. The attack, which bears similarities to the one that killed Hezbollah's leader, has prompted an investigation into a possible insider leak due to its precision. The revelation confirms the president's earlier claims that Israel had attempted to assassinate him.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the significance of the final fight in the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy, a bout that was more tactical and controlled than their previous encounters. The author argues that true equality in women's boxing is not just the right to be thrilling, but also the right to fight strategically and win without needing to be a spectacle. The piece reflects on the contradictions within the sport, where women reclaim their bodies for risk and glory, yet still operate within a system that often objectifies them. It concludes that the trilogy's legacy is a testament to the fighters' choice and defiance.</p>
