          <p>A comprehensive investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products on Walmart.com, sold by third-party vendors using stolen identities of legitimate businesses. The report details how Walmart's push for e-commerce growth led to lax seller vetting processes, allowing potentially dangerous fake goods, such as health supplements and beauty products, to reach consumers. Following the investigation's findings, Walmart has reportedly tightened its policies for sellers in certain categories, demonstrating the real-world impact of the inquiry.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military has conducted a third "lethal kinetic strike" on a boat in international waters suspected of trafficking narcotics, resulting in the deaths of three individuals described as "narcoterrorists." This action is part of a broader administration strategy to target drug cartels, which have been designated as terrorist organizations. The strikes have raised concerns among some Democratic lawmakers, who question the legal authority for such military actions without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok in the United States, potentially avoiding a full ban of the popular social media app. The proposed deal would involve a group of U.S. investors, including Oracle, acquiring TikTok's U.S. business while licensing the core algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance suggest that negotiations are ongoing and key details, particularly regarding the algorithm's ownership, remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old Sikh woman who has lived in California for over 30 years, has prompted shock and calls for her release from community members and politicians. Kaur, who had been reporting to immigration authorities for years following a rejected asylum claim, was detained during a routine check-in. Her case highlights the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement policies, which critics argue are targeting long-term residents without criminal records who have become integrated into their communities.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft is positioning the United Kingdom as a key hub for artificial intelligence development. This influx of capital is seen as a significant boost to the UK economy, fostering a "Silicon Valley stardust" effect on the country's research and tech sectors. While some critics worry about the UK becoming overly dependent on U.S. technology, the deals signify a strong vote of confidence in Britain's scientific and innovative capabilities.

He described the opportunity to grow older with a character as a rare privilege of long-form television and credited the show's success to its powerful writing.</p>

          <p>A protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Chicago escalated when federal agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse demonstrators. The crowd, which included two Democratic congressional candidates, had gathered to oppose "Operation Midway Blitz," an immigration crackdown in the city, and to protest the recent fatal shooting of a man by an immigration officer. The forceful response by masked homeland security agents against what participants described as a peaceful protest has drawn condemnation and accusations of excessive force.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. advisory committee has voted to stop broadly recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for all adults, shifting to a model of shared clinical decision-making with a healthcare provider. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also delayed a vote on the routine hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. These changes represent a significant departure from previous public health guidance and have sparked concern within the medical community about potential confusion and reduced vaccine uptake.</p>

          <p>In the wake of last spring's pro-Palestinian encampment and subsequent pressure from the Trump administration, UCLA has released new, formalized rules governing campus protests. The policies ban unauthorized overnight demonstrations and the use of masks during policy violations, aligning with some federal demands, but they also expand designated free speech zones. The university states the guidelines are meant to balance free expression with campus safety and are not a direct reaction to political pressure, though they come as UCLA faces threats to its federal research funding.</p>

The Estonian government condemned the incursion over the Gulf of Finland as a "brazen" and "extremely dangerous provocation," prompting NATO to immediately scramble jets to intercept the Russian aircraft. This incident marks a significant escalation in tensions on NATO's eastern flank and is seen as a test of the alliance's resolve by Russia.</p>
