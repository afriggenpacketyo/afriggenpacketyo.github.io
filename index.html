          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren SÃ¡nchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrity guests including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The lavish, multi-day event took place on the historic island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with festivities beginning on Thursday. However, the celebration also sparked the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, as local residents protested the influx of ultra-wealthy tourists, which they argue contributes to rising costs and over-tourism in the city. The event highlights a growing tension between high-profile tourism and local community interests in popular European destinations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that aimed to limit President Trump's ability to take further military action against Iran without congressional approval. The measure, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine, failed in a 47-53 vote, reflecting a deep divide on presidential war powers. The debate was fueled by recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, with Democrats expressing anger over a lack of transparency and questioning the administration's claims about the extent of the damage to Iran's program. Supporters of the president's actions argued he acted within his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief.</p>

          <p>In closing arguments, the defense lawyer for Sean "Diddy" Combs depicted the federal prosecution as a "fake trial," arguing that the government had grossly exaggerated evidence. Attorney Marc Agnifilo claimed that the racketeering and sex trafficking charges were a misguided attempt to criminalize Combs' swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use. He asserted that the allegations were motivated by money, not justice. In rebuttal, the prosecution maintained that the trial was about Combs using his power for inexcusable behavior and that domestic abuse is not a defense for sex trafficking.</p>

The ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, granting a partial stay of injunctions against it without deciding the order's constitutionality. While individual plaintiffs in the case remain protected, the decision curtails the ability of a single judge to halt the implementation of a federal policy across the entire country while legal challenges are pending.</p>

          <p>A highly skilled team of technical divers has conducted the first-ever human exploration of the SS Nemesis, a steamship that sank in a storm off the coast of Sydney in 1904, claiming 32 lives. The wreck, which was only discovered in 2022, rests at a challenging depth of approximately 525 feet. The divers successfully navigated the pitch-black depths to survey and document the century-old vessel, providing new insights into the maritime tragedy before undertaking a grueling six-hour decompression ascent back to the surface.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to curtail nationwide injunctions represents a significant expansion of presidential authority. By limiting the ability of lower federal courts to block executive actions on a national scale, the ruling effectively gives the president more leeway to implement policies, even those of questionable legality, while legal challenges proceed. The author, along with dissenting justices, warns that this creates a "profoundly dangerous" situation that could threaten the rule of law by allowing for unchecked executive power and creating a patchwork of rights across the country.</p>

Some fiscally conservative lawmakers, including original members of the 2010 wave like Senator Rand Paul, are once again vocally opposing their own party's spending plans and railing against budget deficits. However, this potential revival faces a different political landscape than the original movement, as these conservatives are now challenging a popular Republican president rather than organizing against a Democratic one, which may limit their influence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Justice Department Inspector General's report has revealed that the Sinaloa drug cartel successfully used modern technology to hunt and kill FBI informants. A hacker working for the cartel obtained the phone records and location data of an FBI official in Mexico City. The cartel then used this information, in conjunction with the city's public surveillance camera system, to track the official, identify their contacts, and subsequently intimidate or kill potential cooperating witnesses, exposing a grave security threat to law enforcement operations.</p>

          <h2>UK Labour MPs Express Frustration with Leadership Over Welfare Reform Concessions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 17:16:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant row over welfare reforms has left many backbench Labour MPs in the UK feeling angry and ignored by their party's leadership. After a backbench revolt, Prime Minister Keir Starmer made concessions on proposed stricter criteria for benefits, but many MPs feel the changes do not go far enough. The episode has exposed deep internal tensions, with some MPs describing Downing Street's handling of the issue as a "bloody shambles" and expressing concern that their views are seen as an inconvenience rather than a valid part of the policy debate.</p>
