          <h2>CATL Shares Surge in Hong Kong Debut Amidst EV Boom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology, the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant surge of over 18% during their Hong Kong debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's capacity to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. The IPO successfully raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the largest offering globally this year, and the funds will be directed towards constructing a new factory in Hungary to cater to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's expansion into Europe is strategically timed, given the anticipated slowdown in growth within China due to high sales penetration and increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, who have placed punitive tariffs on EVs made in China due to unfair trade practices. The company aims to solidify its position as a key player in the global EV battery supply chain. </p>

          <p>The parole hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been rescheduled from June to August, providing them and their attorneys more time to prepare. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office converted their clemency hearing into a parole hearing after withdrawing a request for a clemency investigation, leaving the final decision on their potential release in his hands. The brothers were resentenced to 50 years-to-life, making them eligible for parole after spending 35 years behind bars, where they have argued the killings were in self-defense due to years of abuse from their father. A Facebook post from Lyle Menendez's account confirmed the postponement, expressing optimism that the additional preparation time would improve their chances of being granted parole. </p>

          <p>Benjamin Ritchie, convicted of the 2000 murder of Beech Grove Police Officer Bill Toney, was executed by lethal injection in Indiana, marking the state's second execution in 15 years after a hiatus due to drug shortages. Ritchie, who was 20 at the time of the crime, expressed remorse for his actions, which included fatally shooting Toney during a foot chase after stealing a van, and his attorneys argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure. Despite these arguments and pleas for clemency, Republican Governor Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's bid, and the execution proceeded amid criticism of Indiana's secretive death penalty proceedings, with media access restricted. The execution has reopened debates about capital punishment and the consideration of defendants' mental capacities. </p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek, known as the 'Queen of Clay' for her dominance at the French Open, is seeking her fourth title in five years at Roland Garros, although she faces considerable doubts this year. The 23-year-old Pole arrives in Paris without winning a WTA tournament in the first five months of the season, leading to a drop in her world ranking to fifth. This marks the first time since 2020 that Swiatek enters the tournament without a title win beforehand, raising questions about her ability to continue her reign on the clay court. Despite the challenges, her past success and expertise on clay make her a formidable contender. </p>

          <p>A Florida man, Hung Trinh, was arrested in North Fort Myers after shooting his neighbor's cow five times for wandering onto his property, resulting in the animal's euthanasia. The Lee County Sheriffâ€™s Office Agriculture Unit responded to reports of animal cruelty and found the two-year-old calf with multiple gunshot wounds. Trinh had previously expressed anger about livestock jumping the fence and threatened to shoot the animals, according to the cow's owner. Detectives obtained a search warrant and located the .22 caliber gun allegedly used in the shooting on Trinh's property, leading to charges of animal cruelty and grand theft of a commercial farm animal. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, France, and Canada have issued their strongest condemnation yet of Israel's military actions in Gaza, demanding an end to the offensive due to the intolerable level of human suffering. They argue that Israel's actions are disproportionate, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's justifications for the offensive are insufficient, calling for a ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages. Netanyahu has responded by accusing the leaders of London, Ottawa, and Paris of rewarding the genocidal attack on Israel and has insisted that the war will only end when Hamas returns hostages, lays down arms, and its leaders go into exile. The growing international pressure reflects increasing concern over the humanitarian crisis and the systematic violation of international law in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is portrayed as a pivotal moment for the club, with the potential to generate over Â£100 million through Champions League participation. The match's outcome could significantly impact the club's finances and future prospects, given their disappointing domestic campaign and substantial debt. While qualification for the Champions League would benefit both teams, it is argued that United needs it more due to their larger financial deficit. Failure to win could lead to a further decline, while victory would free up funds for player acquisitions. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration explored acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One, aiming for a quicker solution amid delays in the delivery of new planes. This plan involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. Despite initial discussions about purchasing the plane, it was later characterized as a gift from Qatar, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial practicality of retrofitting the aircraft for presidential use. The arrangement has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who view it as an attempt to curry favor with the administration. </p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election has failed to provide a clear resolution to the country's political instability, resulting in another minority government for the center-right Democratic Alliance. The outcome leaves the government reliant on opposition parties and adds uncertainty due to the rise of the hard-right populist party Chega. The election was triggered by a lost vote of confidence in parliament, prompted by a political storm surrounding potential conflicts of interest in Prime Minister LuÃ­s Montenegro's family law firm. The results underscore ongoing challenges in Portuguese politics, including corruption scandals and debates over immigration and housing. </p>

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her paedophile father has criticized a government bill intended to help others in similar situations. The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children, which the family finds disappointing. The original case involved a mother who spent over Â£30,000 to protect her daughter from her ex-husband, who retained parental responsibility despite being convicted of serious child sexual assault offences. The government has stated it will continue to improve the law to ensure it is as strong as it needs to be. </p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine, highlighting his frustration with both Ukrainian President Zelensky and Russian President Putin. It suggests that Trump's view of the war as primarily a European issue overlooks America's strategic interests in preventing Russia from undermining the post-Cold War order. The author argues that abandoning the peace process in Ukraine would embolden Russia and potentially increase global challenges for the United States, including supporting destabilizing forces and strengthening alliances with China, Iran, and North Korea. The article concludes that failing to invest in resisting Russia now will lead to greater costs for Americans in the future. </p>
