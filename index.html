          <p>The Trump administration has initiated the deportation of individuals convicted of violent crimes, including murder and child sexual assault, to the small African nation of Eswatini. This controversial policy is part of an aggressive, expanded effort to send deportees to third countries, especially when their nations of origin refuse to accept them. Critics express significant concerns regarding the safety and human rights implications for these individuals in unfamiliar and potentially unstable environments, citing previous cases where deportees were held incommunicado. The administration gained a major legal victory last month, allowing it to expedite these deportations by making it more difficult for individuals to contest their removal to a third country.</p>

          <p>A Texas woman, Pamela Jean Stanley, has been indicted on multiple felony charges, including criminal solicitation and attempted murder, for allegedly plotting to kill her ex-husband. Investigators state she planned to mail him fentanyl-laced chocolates, disguised as a congratulatory honeymoon gift, following his recent engagement. Stanley was arrested in Parker County after a sting operation where she met with undercover officers, believing they were fentanyl dealers. A subsequent search of her vehicle also uncovered 11.76 grams of methamphetamine, adding to the severity of the charges and underscoring the complexity of the investigation.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims House GOP Holdouts Now Support Crypto Bill After White House Meeting</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced that House Republicans who initially voted against advancing key cryptocurrency regulation bills, including the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, have now agreed to support them. This dramatic reversal followed a White House meeting, highlighting Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference and the swift political maneuvering involved. The legislation aims to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and other digital assets, and to prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. This unexpected flip among the holdouts underscores the complex interplay between political leadership and emerging financial technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate narrowly advanced President Trump's request to cancel $9 billion in previously approved funding, targeting international aid and federal funding for NPR and PBS. This measure, known as a rescissions package, passed procedural hurdles with Vice President JD Vance casting tie-breaking votes, despite opposition from Democrats and some Republicans concerned about specific program impacts. The White House modified the bill to exclude cuts to the global AIDS prevention program, PEPFAR, aiming for passage before a Friday deadline. Democrats argue this effort fundamentally undermines the bipartisan appropriations process and could jeopardize critical services, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued an ultimatum to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) board, demanding the firing of CEO Don Moul, despite the board's assertion that Moul aligns with Trump's energy expansion vision. This unprecedented demand, reportedly prompted by a dispute over a proposed gas plant, has revived speculation about Trump's long-standing goal of privatizing the TVA, the nation's largest government-owned utility. The move could involve Trump unilaterally seating a majority of the TVA's board without Senate approval. Critics fear privatization could lead to higher electricity prices for consumers and hinder the development of crucial large-scale energy projects like new nuclear reactors.</p>

This pioneering "Flonduran" coral aims to withstand the devastating impacts of warming ocean waters and disease, which have wiped out over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral. This is the first time an international cross of corals has been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs. The first crossbred species have now been planted, with hopes that these tougher corals will provide crucial coastal protection against hurricane-fueled waves.

President Trump expressed sympathy for his conservative ally, labeling the charges a "witch hunt," and previously threatened 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods over the legal proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Central Banks Boost Gold Reserves by Purchasing from Domestic Mines</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks are increasingly acquiring gold directly from domestic mines to bolster their reserves, driven by surging gold prices and the desire to support local industries without impacting foreign exchange reserves. This method is often cheaper than buying on the international market, allowing central banks to grow reserves using local currency and avoid sacrificing other reserve assets. While beneficial for monetary flexibility and supporting domestic mining, it can pose risks related to processing standards and labor practices in artisanal and small-scale mining. This trend reflects a broader strategy among central banks to strengthen their reserve buffers and shield against sudden financial shocks amid rising global debt and geopolitical risks.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed the unpredictable nature of earnings season, highlighting the "terrifying" ups and downs experienced by investors. He noted Nvidia's stock surge following White House approval to sell chips in China, contrasting it with disappointing performances from BlackRock and Wells Fargo. BlackRock faced losses due to lower net inflows, while Wells Fargo's stock dipped after cutting its net interest income guidance despite being free from an asset cap. Cramer expressed frustration with the market's immediate reactions, emphasizing the difficulty of anticipating outcomes despite his long-term confidence in some companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from L.A. County. His wrongful conviction stemmed from shaky witness testimony and ignored alibi evidence, including his presence at his mother's birthday party and wearing a cast that would have made pulling a trigger unlikely. The settlement follows a judge's finding of factual innocence in April 2022 and a lawsuit alleging that sheriff's homicide detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and ignored new information pointing to another suspect. This outcome aims to mitigate the harm caused by two decades of wrongful incarceration.</p>

His death, on the 24th anniversary of the killing, means the Falconio family may never find closure.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue its efforts to dismantle parts of the U.S. Department of Education, including mass layoffs, as it seeks to transfer more power to states. Michael Petrilli of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute noted that while most teachers and students won't notice daily impacts, the significant cuts to offices like Financial Aid and Civil Rights raise concerns about the department's ability to keep up with complaints. Despite President Trump's campaign promise, a full shutdown of the Department of Education is unlikely, as it would require Congressional action, which lacks sufficient support, but it will be smaller.</p>

The world-famous Northumberland landmark, which held deep personal significance for many, was cut down in September 2023, sparking global outrage. King, who previously avoided the site due to his anger and grief, including the recent death of his co-star Dave Myers, described the remaining stump as a "big yawning gap" and the act as "mindless vandalism."

          <p>An independent review recommends that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" and wear standardized clothing and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. This recommendation stems from concerns over patient confusion and safety, with the review hearing from families whose relatives died after being treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors. The review highlighted that the roles were introduced without a clear national plan, leading to ambiguity and instances where PAs covered medical posts without adequate oversight. While some patients reported satisfaction, the British Medical Association argues the review should have gone further to clarify responsibilities.</p>

The company also made inaccurate "0g added sugar" claims, further breaching advertising codes. The ruling mandates the advert not reappear in its current form, and the company was told not to claim its drinks could prevent, treat, or cure human disease.</p>

He believes this oversight led to years of disastrous political turmoil and the hardening of positions, causing unnecessary contemplation over a foreseeable issue.
