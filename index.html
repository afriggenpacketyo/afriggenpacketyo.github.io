        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which experts predict will increase the cost of various consumer goods. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods are expected to be affected, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. While some businesses may absorb these costs, many are likely to pass them on to customers, mirroring the effects of similar tariffs imposed in 2018. The tariffs aim to reduce America's reliance on foreign nations but could strain both industries and consumers due to increased expenses (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's removal of Wells Fargo's asset cap, analysts and Jim Cramer are optimistic about the bank's future growth. The removal of the $1.95 trillion asset cap, imposed due to past misconduct, allows Wells Fargo to expand its deposit base and invest in high-growth business areas. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley have raised their price targets for Wells Fargo shares, anticipating increased loan growth and expansion into capital markets. CEO Charlie Scharf sees this as a significant opportunity to compete more effectively with Wall Street peers and improve customer services (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump and Russian President Putin had a "good" phone call, discussing the recent drone attacks on Russian airfields and other attacks, though Trump stated that the call would not lead to immediate peace. Despite ongoing U.S.-brokered peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is urging Trump to impose stricter sanctions on Moscow, while Trump has threatened both nations with consequences if peace efforts fail. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is pushing for sanctions that would impose high tariffs on countries buying Russian energy products, signaling pressure from both domestic and international actors on Trump's approach to the conflict.

Trump has effectively neutralized federal agencies that safeguard civil servants from political firings. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit suggests that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel are unable to fulfill their roles due to Trump's actions, federal courts should step in to hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. The decision aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected, but its implementation depends on further legal proceedings and potential appeals.</p>

          <p>An AI program trained to study ancient handwriting styles suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than previously thought. By combining AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis, researchers have developed a more accurate method for estimating the age of ancient texts. The redating of some scrolls could reshape our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Judaism, and early Christianity. The AI model, trained on 24 manuscripts with reliable radiocarbon dating, analyzed the handwriting style of 135 scrolls with unknown dates, achieving 79% accuracy.</p>

Jean-Pierre's book, titled *Independent: A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines*, promises a detailed recounting of the weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic party that led to his decision. The announcement comes as the party has been forced to reckon with its decision to staunchly support Biden’s decision to seek a second term as the oldest serving president in American history and despite voter concerns about his age and mental acuity. In comments since leaving the White House, Jean-Pierre described Democrats’ response to Biden’s disastrous June debate against Trump, in which he appeared disoriented and listless, as a “firing squad”.</p>
