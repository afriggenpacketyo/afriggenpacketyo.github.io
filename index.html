          <p>Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter announced that the United States plans to hold 'privileged' negotiations with Switzerland and 14 other countries regarding the sweeping US tariffs that have unsettled global markets. Keller-Sutter expressed satisfaction with talks in Washington, including a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The U.S. aims to find a quick solution to the tariff issue with this group, and a memorandum of understanding is expected to be drawn up to begin negotiations, as uncertainty is considered harmful to the economy.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales saw their largest increase in nearly four years during the first quarter of the year, driven by warmer weather in March that boosted sales of clothing, DIY goods, and garden supplies. According to the Office for National Statistics, sales volumes rose by 1.6% between January and March, marking the biggest quarterly rise since July 2021. Despite the overall growth, food sales volumes declined, particularly in supermarkets, and analysts caution that sales could weaken in the coming months as consumer confidence has fallen.</p>

          <p>A Dutch town hall admitted to accidentally disposing of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix, during renovation work last year. The artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were 'not handled with care', with a lack of proper policies and procedures for storage and security cited as contributing factors. The print was part of Warhol's 'Reigning Queens' series, and the total value of the lost artworks is estimated at around €22,000.</p>
