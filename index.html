          <p>The US-China trade war continues to intensify as both countries impose increasingly high tariffs on each other's goods. Initiated by President Trump in April, the conflict has seen the US hiking tariffs on Chinese goods by 145%, with China retaliating with 125% tariffs on American products. These extreme tariff levels have effectively halted bilateral trade, raising concerns about the long-term economic impact. While Trump has suggested that China would capitulate first, Beijing's resolve and capacity to withstand economic hardship remain strong.</p>

Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to private institutions, primarily benefiting wealthier families already in private education.

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, but reiterated his call for Powell to lower interest rates. Trump expressed his belief that Powell should lower rates and accused him of disliking him, but ruled out removing him from his position. He also said that he would be able to replace Powell in a short period of time. The president's comments come amid ongoing discussions about economic policy and the role of the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and cost overruns, raising questions about the country's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The project's ambitions have been reduced to a 171-mile segment between Bakersfield and Merced, with initial cost estimates tripling. Eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser disputes claims that property acquisition is the primary cause of delays, citing other factors such as permitting requirements and lack of full funding.
