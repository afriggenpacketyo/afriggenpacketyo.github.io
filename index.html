          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 is underway in Basel, Switzerland, featuring artists from 26 countries and an estimated 160 million viewers worldwide. Sweden's comedy trio KAJ is favored to win with their sauna-themed song, but Austria, France, the Netherlands, Finland, and Israel are also contenders. The event is marked by political discord, particularly regarding Israel's participation due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which has led to pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel protests in Basel. Organizers anticipate over 500,000 attendees throughout the week, with fans praising the contest's increasing diversity and the potential appearance of Celine Dion, who represented Switzerland in 1988. </p>

          <p>Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, are pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants facing removal. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law, emphasizing the need for immigrants to challenge their deportations. This stance aligns with the Constitution's protection of 'persons,' not just citizens, and comes amid concerns that the administration is manipulating the process to avoid judicial review. The courts are ensuring immigrants have the opportunity to contest their deportations, especially when novel powers are claimed by officials.</p>

          <p>Romania's upcoming presidential runoff election between hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion and pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan is causing tension within the European Union. Simion, who won the first round, admires Trump and Orban, while Dan is a pro-European mathematician and anti-corruption activist. The election is crucial for Romania, the sixth-largest EU country, and for Europe, as a Simion victory could destabilize Romania's partnerships with the EU and NATO. Simion has softened his rhetoric but still faces scrutiny for anti-Ukrainian sentiments and lack of experience, while Dan's pro-European stance offers stability but struggles to gain traction with voters.</p>

The spring tornado season has been particularly brutal, with this latest outbreak exacerbating the strain on disaster relief efforts already facing staffing and funding cuts.

Significant gaps remain, with Trump insisting on halting uranium enrichment and Iran asserting its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Negotiations are being led by Steve Witkoff, who is exploring creative solutions to bridge these differences, such as a long-term freeze on enrichment under enhanced inspections.</p>

          <p>Arizona Democrats are facing a challenging political landscape as they prepare for the 2026 elections, with concerns surrounding Governor Katie Hobbs's re-election prospects. Hobbs, considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic governors, faces a divided state party and potential formidable Republican challengers, including Andy Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, both endorsed by President Trump. While Hobbs has taken a moderate approach, she has faced criticism from within her own party for vetoing certain bills and maintaining a low profile, adding to the challenges in a state with a Republican advantage.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have commenced a new round of ceasefire talks in Doha, mediated by Qatari and US officials, following Israel's launch of "Operation Gideon's Chariots." The new talks aim to address the release of hostages in exchange for a period of calm, but obstacles remain. The operation involves intensified bombardments and airstrikes, with the IDF vowing to dismantle Hamas. The intensified offensive has drawn condemnation from the UN and European leaders amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where warnings of famine among the population have grown.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is increasing its economic and strategic presence in Africa, filling a void as the United States and China reduce their investments. Emirati investments have exploded in recent years, focusing on key sectors like ports, renewable energy, and critical minerals. The Emirates' ambitious plan aims to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. has historically maintained close security ties with the Emirates, some of its political choices, such as alleged support for a paramilitary group in Sudan, have raised concerns.</p>

          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reports that combat sport clubs are being used to recruit members for the white nationalist group Patriot Front. These "Active Clubs" promote white supremacist ideologies through mixed martial arts training and maintain an online presence to radicalize young men.
