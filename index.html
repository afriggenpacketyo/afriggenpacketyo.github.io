          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has identified cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in international travelers arriving in the U.S., linking it to a significant surge in China. Cases have been reported across multiple states, with health authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan also reporting increases in emergency room visits and hospitalizations. While preliminary data suggests the variant may be more transmissible, it doesn't appear to be better at evading the immune system than other strains. The FDA's vaccine advisors have discussed updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming seasons, considering the potential impact of NB.1.8.1.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump's removal of two Democratic appointees, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, from federal boards, settling a legal dispute over presidential firing powers. The ruling favored the president's authority to remove executive officers without cause, while distinguishing the Federal Reserve Board's unique structure. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision granted the president excessive power over the Executive Branch. The case centered on the interpretation of a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor, which limited a president's ability to fire independent board members without cause.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that murder charges can proceed against two men accused of killing Sidney Barrett Morris, a California State University, Northridge, official, despite authorities not establishing a motive. Morris was shot in the back of the head at L.A. Live in 2023, and prosecutors allege that Phillip Clark was the shooter and Santana Kelly orchestrated the killing. The case relies on surveillance videos, phone records, and jail calls, though defense lawyers argued for dismissal due to lack of direct evidence connecting their clients to Morris. The defendants will be arraigned in June.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a policy that provides basic rights and protections to child immigrants in custody. The administration argues that the agreement incentivizes unauthorized border crossings and hinders the effective detention and removal of families. Critics argue that ending these protections is unconscionable, especially given the current conditions of family detention centers and the challenges faced by unaccompanied children seeking legal aid. The move follows other actions targeting children, including the restarting of family detentions.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, the highest level in over two years, driven partly by surging rice prices. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs, with Governor Kazuo Ueda signaling intentions to raise rates based on price trends. Economists expect core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. The strengthening of the yen and potential government subsidies for electricity and gas bills could also contribute to downward pressure on inflation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump held a gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play and conflicts of interest. The event, held at Trump's golf club, saw hundreds of investors, including crypto moguls and celebrities, spending millions to attend. Critics argue Trump is using his position to enrich himself through the meme coin, while protesters decried the event as corruption. The value of $TRUMP fluctuated significantly around the gala announcement, with many investors incurring losses.

Changes include reducing the number of services per horse, providing more rest time, and using lighter carriages. Soldiers are undergoing intensive training, with a focus on both animal welfare and the solemn duty of honoring fallen service members and their families.

          <p>The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld, for now, President Trump’s decision to fire two agency officials who had fixed terms that were set by Congress. By a 6-3 vote, the justices set aside rulings that would have reinstated Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Both were appointees of President Biden. The decision is the latest in which the court’s conservative majority sided with the president’s power to fire agency officials in violation of long-standing laws.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court upheld President Trump's decision to fire two agency officials with fixed terms, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, appointed by President Biden. The justices sided with the president's power to remove executive officers without cause, citing the Constitution. However, the court clarified that the Federal Reserve Board is not affected by this decision. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing the order favored the President over precedent. The decision is not final, as a fundamental dispute over the president's power to set the structure of the federal government remains.</p>

          <p>In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total. Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup — more than households with teens. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands. Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts "get ready with me" TikToks — chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed.</p>

          <p>The skincare industry is increasingly marketing products to tweens, including some with anti-aging ingredients that can be harmful to young skin. Social media influencers, often in partnership with brands, promote skincare smoothies and regimens that include products with retinols and other harsh ingredients. Lawmakers are considering legislation to restrict the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18. The FTC requires influencers to disclose material connections to brands, but disclosures are often subtle or absent. Some brands have launched counter-marketing campaigns to inform kids about appropriate skincare.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, set forth their vision on Thursday for how to “make America healthy again” with the release of an expansive report on a crisis of chronic disease in children. The report lays the blame on ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, stress, lack of physical activity and excessive use of prescription drugs, including antidepressants. The product of a presidential commission led by Mr. Kennedy, the report paints a bleak picture of American children, calling them “the sickest generation in American history.” Rather than set out specific policy prescriptions, it offers up carefully selected studies and proposes new research.</p>

Khalil, who has been detained in Louisiana for over two months, argued that he has been mislabeled a terrorist sympathizer and would be a target internationally. Witnesses testified that his prominence meant Israel would target him if deported. The hearing ended inconclusively, with lawyers submitting closing arguments by June 2. A Homeland Security Department spokeswoman suggested Khalil use the CBP Home app to self-deport, with the U.S. offering $1,000 and a free flight.</p>

She wrote and illustrated "The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane" in 1976, and designed bagel-themed merchandise. Later, she designed toys, including Sweetie Pops and Baby Check-Up, which sold millions worldwide.

          <p>The sprawling domestic policy bill Republicans pushed through the House on Thursday would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and members of his administration from the consequences of violating court orders. It comes as federal judges have opened inquiries about whether to hold the Trump administration in contempt for violating their orders in cases related to its aggressive deportation efforts. The language in the House-passed bill would block federal judges from enforcing their contempt citations if they had not previously ordered a bond, a provision that Republicans said was intended to discourage frivolous lawsuits by requiring a financial stake from those suing.</p>

But their annoyance is also a signal of something less expected – policies of US President Donald Trump meeting resistance from people in the rural areas whose votes drove his return to the White House.
