          <p>Climate activists in the U.S. are organizing a national "Sun Day" to advocate for solar power and energy efficiency, pushing back against the Trump administration's extensive rollbacks of climate protections. Led by Bill McKibben, the event aims to showcase renewable energy solutions, such as solar panel installations and electric school bus fleets, rather than traditional protests. Organizers acknowledge criticisms that the optimistic tone might seem out of sync with current environmental challenges but believe it fosters hope and attracts new allies to the climate movement, including conservatives interested in independent power supplies. The initiative seeks to accelerate the transition to fossil-free energy despite federal opposition, recognizing its crucial role in catching up with global warming's physics.</p>

          <p>Residents of Whiting, Indiana, are grappling with severe environmental and health consequences stemming from recurring issues at the BP Whiting Refinery, the Midwest's largest fuel processing facility. A recent severe thunderstorm caused flooding that led to oil and gas fumes infiltrating basements, alongside a visible hydrocarbon sheen observed along Lake Michigan's shoreline. Community members voice deep-seated fears over the refinery's frequent accidents and its perceived lack of transparency regarding environmental impact, particularly concerning potential pollution into Lake Michigan. This situation is further exacerbated by the Trump administration's dismantling of environmental regulations, intensifying threats to local communities from industrial operations and increasing climate-fueled weather events.</p>

          <p>Renowned actor Sylvester Stallone expressed profound humility and disbelief after receiving a prestigious Kennedy Center honor, an award he described as something he never anticipated achieving. He told Fox News Digital that he would perform his work for free, making the recognition for his contributions to American culture deeply surprising and cherished. President Donald Trump, serving as the Kennedy Center chairman, personally oversaw the selection of this year's honorees, including country legend George Strait and rock band KISS, with an aim to reshape the celebration into a more star-studded event. Stallone also reflected on his current hit series, "Tulsa King," identifying it as the role most authentically reflecting his true personality and discussing the creative challenges of maintaining its quality for future seasons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three practical steps for adults to rediscover and integrate creativity into their lives, countering the societal tendency to abandon playful pursuits after childhood. It suggests tapping into past interests, keeping creative endeavors low-pressure, and sharing creations without the intent of monetization to foster genuine enjoyment and sustained engagement. Experts emphasize that unstructured, exploratory thinking from hobbies can enhance creativity in other life domains and provide emotional benefits, such as reducing sadness and anger. The article encourages individuals to prioritize creative activities by connecting them to their core identity, rather than viewing them as another skill to master or monetize, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling sense of self.</p>

          <p>ABC has indefinitely pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air after the host made controversial comments linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. This decision followed threats from the Trump-nominated FCC Chair, Brendan Carr, who suggested ABC's broadcast license was at risk. Nexstar Media Group, an ABC affiliate owner, also preempted the show, citing Kimmel's "offensive and insensitive" remarks that they felt did not reflect community values. While Kimmel has not been fired, Disney plans discussions regarding his future on-air statements, sparking a broader debate about free speech, corporate cowardice, and governmental pressure on media, with unions and Democratic lawmakers condemning the move.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on Brazilian and Mexican imports are unexpectedly leading to lower food prices for consumers in those countries. Products originally destined for the U.S. market, such as coffee and beef in Brazil and tomatoes in Mexico, are now being redirected to domestic markets, increasing supply and driving down costs. While beneficial for local consumers in the short term, economists warn that this could disincentivize producers from investing, potentially leading to reduced production, lower productivity, and even losses in quality, ultimately causing prices to rise again. The tariffs were imposed in response to the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the growing trend of individuals and even doctors using AI chatbots like ChatGPT for medical information and second opinions, highlighting both its potential benefits and significant risks. While AI can process vast amounts of medical data and occasionally offer accurate diagnoses that human doctors miss, it also has a "stubborn tendency to hallucinate" and provide dangerously incorrect advice, such as suggesting toxic substances. Experts caution patients against relying on chatbots for direct medical advice due to privacy concerns and the difficulty in discerning factual from fabricated information. However, AI can be a valuable tool for understanding existing diagnoses or formulating questions for a doctor, enhancing patient-physician conversations without replacing professional care.</p>

The article suggests motivated reasoning played a significant role, where individuals are reluctant to admit negative aspects of their own political movements, leading to self-serving interpretations of events.

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, is a political satire and black comedy that aims to reflect the growing polarization and divisiveness in contemporary culture. DiCaprio, who stars as a paranoid ex-revolutionary, notes that the article doesn't have a singular central message but explores an "interesting undercurrent about extremism." The film, which has received warm critical acclaim for its "ferocious" and "swaggering" qualities, finds humanity in its flawed characters and touches on themes of dissent and not fitting in, which are particularly relevant in the current political climate. DiCaprio expressed that the film holds a mirror up to society's polarity.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mehdi Hasan discusses the complexities of debating fascists and far-right extremists, drawing from his experience on Jubilee Media's "Surrounded" show. While aiming to foster empathy and reach new audiences, Hasan encountered participants who proudly identified as fascists and called for his deportation, prompting him to question the value of such engagement. He argues against platforming those who do not believe in democracy or equal human worth, asserting that the goal of debate is not to change an opponent's mind but to influence the audience. The article explores the fine line between promoting discourse and legitimizing harmful ideologies, advocating for defeating fascism by offering better alternatives and being truthful.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is visiting Madrid to meet Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, with European political and security issues, particularly differing policies towards Israel, high on the agenda. While both leaders have sharply criticized Israel's military operation in Gaza, which has led to a humanitarian crisis, Germany has resisted imposing any sanctions beyond curbing some arms exports. Spain, however, has taken a far more proactive stance, joining South Africa's genocide lawsuit at the International Court of Justice and announcing an arms embargo and travel ban against those involved in human rights violations. The meeting occurs as the EU considers broader sanctions, highlighting a growing rift within the bloc on this critical international conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in U.S. investment, expected to create 7,600 jobs, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major firms like Blackstone, Microsoft, and Google are committing billions, aiming to deepen economic ties between the two nations. This positive news comes amidst challenges, including stalled steel tariff deals and pharmaceutical companies halting UK investments due to perceived difficulties, such as undervaluing innovative medicines. While a significant boost, the announcement contrasts with a domestic slowdown in investment and falling payroll numbers in the UK, reflecting a complex economic landscape.

          <p>This opinion column critically assesses President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, arguing it failed to produce any positive results, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine. The author contends that Putin gained an "unstated license" to escalate aggression, evidenced by recent Russian attacks in Ukraine and unprecedented incursions into NATO ally Poland's airspace. Trump's response is described as "impotent," blaming predecessors while resisting sanctions against Russia, even as he levied tariffs on other nations for buying Russian oil. The article highlights a perceived "bystander phase" in Trump's foreign policy, leading to international criticism and mockery from Moscow, suggesting Russia continues to achieve its objectives in Ukraine while Trump appears passive.</p>

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration reported 15.89 million visa-free entries by foreign nationals from January to August, representing roughly two-thirds of all international arrivals. This significant growth is largely attributed to new reciprocal visa-free agreements, notably with Malaysia, which saw 150,000 visa-free trips to China since July 17. Russia is also anticipated to become a major source of visa-free visitors, indicating a strategic effort by China to boost tourism and international exchange through relaxed travel policies. This surge in arrivals suggests a successful policy shift in attracting foreign visitors and strengthening regional ties, contributing positively to China's global engagement and economy.</p>

          <p>“Phasmagorica” is a unique, immersive séance experience at L.A.'s Heritage Square Museum, reimagined as art by composer-turned-magician BC Smith. Designed for both believers and skeptics, the event aims to recreate the feeling of late 1880s séances, focusing on historical context rather than illusions, with Smith purposefully absent from the room. Participants engage with spirit boards and scrying mirrors in pitch darkness, creating a deeply personal and unmediated encounter. The sold-out event taps into a modern search for connection and meaning, offering a safe space for personal exploration into the mysterious and the historical practices of communing with the deceased, ultimately transforming Smith into a "hopeful skeptic."</p>

The use of solitary confinement, which the UN considers torture after 15 days, increased at twice the rate seen in previous years, disproportionately affecting vulnerable detainees who spent significantly longer periods in isolation. The report attributes this trend to expanded detention funding and highlights systemic issues like arbitrary and retaliatory placements, urging an end to the practice for civil immigration detainees.
