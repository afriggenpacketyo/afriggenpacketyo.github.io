          <p>Gene Simmons, the vocalist and bassist for the rock band KISS, was involved in a car accident in Los Angeles after he reportedly passed out while driving. Simmons later assured fans he was "completely fine," attributing the incident to being a "horrible driver." His wife, Shannon, explained that he was likely dehydrated due to a new medication and his dislike of drinking water, which caused him to lose consciousness before his vehicle struck a parked car. No serious injuries were reported, and Simmons is recovering at home after a brief hospitalization.</p>

          <p>A New York City judge has dismissed a civil summons for disorderly conduct against Alex O’Keefe, a former writer for the show “The Bear.” The case stemmed from a September incident where O'Keefe, who is Black, was detained by MTA police on a train following a complaint from a white passenger about him occupying two seats. O’Keefe maintained he was harassed and “detained for sitting while Black,” while police alleged he was disruptive and delayed the train. The judge deemed the summons “facially insufficient,” effectively ending the case against him.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff. His arrest concludes a months-long, multi-agency manhunt that began after the group broke out of the facility through a hole behind a toilet. Authorities tracked Groves to a home using a tip and took him into custody without incident. Groves has a history of violent crime, including a second-degree murder conviction, and his escape was attributed to staffing and design flaws at the jail.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have arrested Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old Florida man, on suspicion of arson for the destructive Palisades Fire. He is accused of starting a smaller fire on January 1st that smoldered underground for a week within dense vegetation. Authorities allege that catastrophic Santa Ana winds on January 7th caused this initial blaze to reignite and spread, leading to the devastating inferno that killed twelve people and destroyed over 6,800 structures in the Los Angeles area. The suspect faces a felony charge of destruction of property by fire.</p>

          <p>As the Palace Museum in Beijing celebrates its 100th anniversary, the history of its priceless collection reflects a period of national turmoil and resilience. During wartime from 1933 to 1950, thousands of artifacts were transported over 10,000 miles across China for safekeeping, a journey that underscores their cultural significance. This heritage remains physically divided, with major collections housed in museums in both Beijing and Taipei, a situation that continues to mirror cross-strait political tensions. The story highlights the enduring power of cultural preservation.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan report has revealed that Chinese semiconductor firms purchased $38 billion in advanced chipmaking equipment over the last year, circumventing existing U.S. export controls. The report found that inconsistent rules among the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands created loopholes that allowed non-U.S. suppliers to continue sales. In response, lawmakers in Washington are calling for expanded and more stringent restrictions to curb China's rapid advancement in chip manufacturing capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Washington, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. According to a source familiar with the talks, the topic was raised as part of a broader conversation about U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, and Trump was said to be receptive to the idea. The controversial pipeline, which would connect Alberta's oil sands to the U.S., has been repeatedly blocked by previous administrations due to significant environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>The office of French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that a new prime minister will be named within two days, following the resignation of Sébastien Lecornu. Lecornu's departure marks the third time a prime minister has left the post in less than a year, a direct consequence of France's hung parliament and persistent political instability. The next appointed leader will face the immediate and difficult challenge of passing a national budget and navigating deep ideological divisions to form a functioning government.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators' conclusion that the catastrophic Palisades fire was a "holdover" from a smaller, earlier blaze has raised questions about the Los Angeles Fire Department's initial response. A criminal complaint notes that the LAFD believed the January 1st fire was fully extinguished, but it continued to smolder underground in root systems for days. Fire experts and critics are now questioning whether the department could have done more to patrol the area and prevent its reignition, especially given that a major windstorm was forecasted.</p>

Bompastor acknowledged the result was not good enough and stated the team needed to show more desire and be more clinical in front of goal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to increase the amount the National Health Service pays for medicines by as much as 25%. This move is an attempt to resolve a tense standoff with pharmaceutical companies and the Trump administration, which has accused other countries of "freeloading" on high U.S. drug prices. The plan follows threats of U.S. tariffs and recent decisions by major drugmakers to cancel or pause nearly £2 billion in UK investments, but it faces resistance from the Treasury over how to fund the increased costs.</p>
