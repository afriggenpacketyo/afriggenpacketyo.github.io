          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has announced the purchase of shares in Corning, a key manufacturer of specialty glass and fiber optic cables. The investment is framed as a long-term play on the significant expansion of AI infrastructure, which requires vast amounts of fiber for modern data centers. Analysts cited in the article project a substantial increase in revenue for Corning's optical communications division, fueled by demand from companies like Nvidia and major AI developers. The trust is beginning with a modest position, allowing for potential future purchases if the stock price dips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a critical minerals agreement between the United States and Australia, China has stated that countries rich in rare earths should play a proactive role in maintaining stable global supply chains. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that global production chains are a result of market forces and corporate decisions. The U.S.-Australia deal is widely seen as an effort to counter Beijing's dominance in the rare earths market, a sector critical for products ranging from electric vehicles to semiconductors, especially after China recently expanded its export controls on these materials.</p>

          <p>General Motors has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting third-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to surge. The automaker now anticipates higher adjusted earnings and automotive free cash flow, signaling confidence despite a challenging market. However, the company's net income was significantly impacted by special charges related to its pullback from certain all-electric vehicle plans, as executives acknowledged that EV profitability is taking longer than expected. Gains in international markets, particularly China, helped to offset a decline in North American profit margins.</p>

The attack, which killed two other crew members, is part of a series of U.S. operations in the Caribbean targeting alleged narcotics vessels. A second survivor, a Colombian citizen, was repatriated and remains hospitalized with serious injuries, where he will face prosecution. The U.S. strikes have drawn criticism from some South American leaders, who question the strategy and its deadly outcomes.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a plan aimed at boosting business growth by cutting administrative red tape and eliminating "needless form filling." The proposed reforms, unveiled at an investment summit, are projected to save businesses nearly £6 billion annually by the end of the parliamentary term. Key measures include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small firms. While business groups welcomed the initiative, some expressed skepticism, stating the true test will be whether the government avoids raising employer taxes in the upcoming Budget.</p>

Their nomination credits his administration's 'Operation Warp Speed' initiative for accelerating the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The lawmakers, both medical doctors, argue the program saved millions of lives globally by overcoming bureaucratic hurdles to bring a vaccine to market in record time. This move follows other pushes by congressional Republicans to nominate Trump for the award, including for his role in negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>Rural economies in the U.S. Midwest that depend on deer hunting are facing a growing threat from infectious diseases like chronic wasting disease (CWD) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). These diseases are killing wild deer in increasing numbers, leading to significant financial losses for landowners and businesses that cater to hunters. Experts suggest that climate change may be contributing to the spread, with warmer temperatures and drought conditions favoring the pathogens and their carriers.

The article explores the artistic and cultural reasons behind these often unflattering representations, from the infamous "Scary Lucy" statue of Lucille Ball to a crooked bust of Cristiano Ronaldo. Art experts suggest that the demand for hyper-realism creates an impossible standard, as even minor inaccuracies can result in an uncanny or menacing appearance. Furthermore, the process of commissioning public art often involves committees and deadlines that can stifle true artistic interpretation in favor of a safe but uninspired final product.</p>

The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration's broader strategy of sending federal forces into cities led by Democrats to address what it describes as uncontrolled crime.

          <p>A man who allegedly threatened on social media to commit a mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was arrested at the terminal before he could carry out the attack. Authorities were alerted by the suspect's family, who reported his threats and that he was armed with a semi-automatic rifle. Police located the man inside the airport and subsequently found an AR-15 with ammunition in his truck. Officials credited the family's quick action and the coordinated response of law enforcement with preventing a tragedy at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, beginning a five-year sentence for conspiring to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Despite protesting his innocence, Sarkozy was taken to La Santé prison in Paris, where he will be held in the isolation wing for his own safety. The conviction marks a significant moment in French politics, as no former head of state has been jailed since the World War Two era. Sarkozy continues to appeal the verdict, describing the case as a politically motivated act of revenge.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, leading to a rise in its stock price. However, the beverage company noted that overall consumer demand for its products remains soft, with unit case volume showing only a slight increase. Key markets like North America and Latin America saw flat volume growth, indicating that lower-income consumers may be cutting back on purchases. The company's growth was primarily driven by its water, sports, coffee, and tea segments, while its core sparkling soft drinks category was stagnant.

          <p>The posthumous publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre is intensifying pressure on Britain's Prince Andrew, as the book details her alleged sexual encounters with him. Giuffre, a victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein who took her own life in April, accused the prince of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager, a lawsuit he settled out of court in 2022. The book's release coincides with a parliamentary motion calling for Andrew to be formally stripped of the titles he has already pledged to renounce. The prince has consistently denied the allegations against him.</p>

          <p>A man who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Christopher Moynihan sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries at an event in New York City. Moynihan, who was convicted in 2022 of obstructing an official proceeding, now faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat. The arrest highlights concerns raised by critics of the blanket pardons for January 6 defendants about the potential for recidivism and further political violence.</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of power-hungry data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is contributing to rising electricity bills for households across the United States. As tech companies rush to secure massive amounts of energy for both existing and planned facilities, the increased demand is straining power grids and driving up infrastructure costs. In Maryland, a consumer advocate has asked the regional grid operator to intervene, arguing that speculation for future energy needs is unfairly raising current prices for residential customers. This highlights a growing backlash against the hidden costs of the tech industry's expansion.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that black garden ants actively redesign their nests to slow the transmission of deadly pathogens, a behavior scientists are calling "architectural immunity." When exposed to a lethal fungus, the ants build more compartmentalized nests with fewer interconnections and more distant entrances. These structural changes, combined with social distancing behaviors like self-isolation of infected individuals, create a highly effective defense against epidemics. Scientists suggest that these findings could offer inspiration for human public health, providing principles for designing spaces that naturally reduce the risk of disease transmission.</p>

The agency's central role suggests that the evidence used to justify these strikes will likely remain classified, preventing public scrutiny and legal review.

          <p>A growing number of U.S. federal judges, including those appointed by Republicans, are issuing strong rebukes to the Trump administration's policies on crime, immigration, and the deployment of military forces. Legal scholars note a pattern of courts rejecting the administration's sweeping claims of emergency powers as factually untethered and legally unsound. Recent rulings have blocked the deployment of the National Guard in cities and challenged deportation policies, with judges bluntly stating that the administration's arguments lack credibility.

With the landscape erased and civil infrastructure ground to dust, the future for young people is suspended. The piece argues that for Palestinians in Gaza, a ceasefire is not an end to war but the beginning of a different kind of struggle: one of memory, loss, and the monumental task of rebuilding from rubble.</p>

          <p>While initially celebrated by Israel's right-wing factions, President Trump's Gaza peace plan has begun to frustrate their ambitions, particularly the goal of resettling the territory. The agreement explicitly rejects any Israeli territorial claims on Gaza and was imposed on a reluctant Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is politically dependent on the far-right. This follows Trump's earlier declaration that he would not permit Israel to annex the West Bank. However, the analysis suggests that while Trump has temporarily contained the settler movement, its activists will likely exploit any delays or openings in the fragile ceasefire to advance their agenda.</p>

The results reflect a growing pessimism in Taiwan about the reliability of the United States as a security partner, a trend that has increased during Trump's second term.
