          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, has announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases as the primary reason for his decision, expressing that such support is inappropriate for the U.S. Attorney in D.C. given the nature of the riot. The Jan. 6 cases were prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. before Trump issued blanket pardons to defendants in the cases on his first day back in the White House in January. Tillis's opposition likely dooms Martin's chances of confirmation, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates the stock market will decline to new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones attributes this bearish outlook to Trump's focus on tariffs and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates, which he believes will negatively impact the stock market. He suggests that any tariff reduction would still represent the largest tax increase since the 1960s, further hindering economic growth. Jones gained prominence by accurately predicting the 1987 stock market crash and currently chairs the nonprofit Just Capital, which assesses U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.

          <p>Drone strikes have hit Port Sudan, Sudan's de facto wartime capital, marking an escalation in the country's ongoing civil war. The Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.), a Sudanese paramilitary group, launched the attacks targeting key civilian facilities, including a fuel depot, the airport, and a hotel believed to be housing diplomats. These attacks have brought violence to a city that had previously been a haven for civilians fleeing the conflict, causing widespread fear and disruption. The Sudanese military has been accused of using chemical weapons and indiscriminately targeting civilians, while the R.S.F. has been accused of ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House on Tuesday, setting the stage for a potentially tense meeting as relations between Washington and Ottawa have reached a low point due to trade disputes. Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, leading to a decline in Canadian exports to the United States. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has portrayed Canada as economically dependent on the United States. Last year, Canada was the United States' second-largest trading partner after Mexico, with total goods trade totaling roughly $762 billion, according to the U.S. Trade Representative.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to a combination of factors, including air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and ongoing runway construction. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has cited equipment outages and staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is based, as contributing factors. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule due to the FAA challenges. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to release details of a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt, overcoming an initial defeat. The first vote saw Merz fall six votes short of the absolute majority he needed, a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history. His coalition with the Social Democrats should have had enough seats in parliament from the start, but it appears some members dissented during the first vote. Merz, 69, will now be sworn in as chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his team of 17 ministers will take office.</p>

          <p>Missing payments on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) can lead to late fees, a damaged credit score, default, and even foreclosure. Experts recommend contacting the lender immediately to explore options like deferred payments or modified payment plans. Requesting forbearance for short-term issues or exploring payment plans can also help manage the situation. It's important to act quickly to avoid the most serious consequences, such as losing your home.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate panel is considering cases involving two international students, Rumeysa Ozturk and Mohsen Mahdawi, who were detained by immigration officials and face removal from the U.S. after expressing criticism of Israel. The Trump administration revoked Ozturk's student visa, while Mahdawi was detained during a citizenship interview. Lower court judges have ruled in favor of the students, but the administration is seeking to pause those orders. The cases have sparked concerns about free speech and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer additional health benefits beyond preventing the viral infection, including a reduced risk of heart disease. The study found that people who received the vaccine had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on inflammation may contribute to the reduced heart disease risk.</p>
