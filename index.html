He expressed a commitment to restoring the economy, national security, peace, and democracy, and emphasized a pragmatic approach to diplomacy centered on national interests.

          <p>Eighteen years after Madeleine McCann's disappearance, Portuguese and German authorities have resumed their search in Praia da Luz, Portugal, focusing on abandoned buildings and wells. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from an apartment complex in 2007, sparking a high-profile missing persons case. The current search covers a 21 sq km site near where Madeleine disappeared and where the prime suspect, Christian Brückner, had been staying. Brückner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for the sexual assault of an American tourist in Portugal in 2005. The search involves dozens of uniformed and plain clothes personnel, with roads closed and firefighters draining a well. The investigation continues with the hope of finding new leads in this long-unsolved case.</p>

          <p>A couple volunteering at Vindolanda, a Roman fort near Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, unearthed a sandstone carving of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory. The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks and is believed to have been part of a larger, brightly painted ornamental arch and gate. Experts suggest the carving represents the end of the Severan wars and the establishment of the fort at the site. The Vindolanda Trust curator noted that similar finds from Roman Britain are increasingly rare, highlighting the importance of the discovery.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that it is "extremely hard" to make a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping, amid ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. This statement comes despite recent suggestions from the White House that the two leaders might speak this week to address the stalled trade talks. Trump accused China of violating a trade agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12, which included a suspension of tariffs. China has criticized the U.S. for limiting China's access to advanced technology and revoking visas for Chinese students. The future of trade negotiations remains uncertain.</p>

In his commencement address, Powell emphasized the importance of doing what is right and maintaining honor.

Powell has maintained a wait-and-see approach, focusing on economic data and the Fed's mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, independent of political pressure.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a £15 billion investment in transport infrastructure projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This investment marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. Reeves aims to address regional disparities by directing more funds to areas in need, including the "Red Wall" constituencies. The transport investment is part of a five-year funding allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32, doubling the current spending allocation by 2029-30.</p>

The U.K. will maintain a 25% tariff while details of their recently signed trade deal with the U.S. are finalized. The U.S. accounts for 7% of the U.K.'s steel exports, worth £370 million in 2024. UK Steel expressed cautious optimism, noting the exemption provides a welcome pause but uncertainty remains. Trump warned that the U.K.'s tariff could increase to 50% if the White House determines the trade deal's aspects are not complied with, creating instability for the steel industry.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the Model Y. Despite a global sales slump, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, with Model Y sales soaring 122.5% year-over-year. However, total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. The company's global sales have been affected by increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities, although recent shifts indicate a potential recovery. Tesla faces tighter competition, particularly from Chinese EV makers like BYD, which has been expanding globally.</p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, causing uncertainty among global trade partners and raising concerns about the world economy. The boosted levies, which went into effect at midnight EDT, have strained U.S. ties with trading partners, prompting negotiations to avoid the duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the Trump levies, noting the tariffs' impact on trade, consumption, and investment. While the U.K. has been granted a temporary reprieve with tariffs remaining at 25%, the EU and Canada have expressed strong opposition and are considering retaliatory measures. The heightened tensions underscore the ongoing trade war and its potential economic repercussions.</p>
