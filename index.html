          <p>More than 20 individuals were arrested in London during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The arrests were made under the Terrorism Act 2000, which now criminalizes any support for the group. The ban follows an incident where the group claimed responsibility for causing millions in damages to military aircraft. Despite a failed legal challenge to block the ban, protesters gathered in Parliament Square, leading to their detention by Metropolitan Police.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have resulted in at least 27 fatalities, with children among the victims. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, inundating the area and leaving dozens of people, including campers from a local summer camp, unaccounted for. Emergency crews are engaged in extensive search and rescue operations as officials describe the situation as an "extraordinary catastrophe." President Trump has acknowledged the tragedy and stated his administration is coordinating with state officials to provide support.</p>

          <p>Golfer Tiger Woods and Vanessa Trump, the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., are reportedly in a "very serious" relationship, with sources suggesting a potential marriage in the future. The couple, who publicly confirmed their relationship in March, have been seen together at various golf events, as their children are also competitive golfers. This development follows Woods' previous high-profile relationships and a very public divorce. Woods is currently recovering from a ruptured Achilles injury, which he sustained earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for an email claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the communication as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie." The bill actually provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of taxes, which will phase out for higher-income seniors. The agency's statement has been condemned as an unprecedented and unconscionable politicization of a typically apolitical government body. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A focus group of 2024 Labour voters in Kent has revealed a prevailing sense of disappointment with the party's first year in power. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, and criticized the government for repeated policy U-turns.

In the past week, Trump has targeted figures like Elon Musk, prospective NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and former official Alejandro Mayorkas with warnings of deportation, arrest, or investigation. Analysts suggest these actions serve to intimidate opposition and represent a continued assault on constitutional norms and freedom of speech.

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while gathering crucial data about ocean health. The research team, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, studies hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. By examining the contents of a shark's stomach, a process which involves temporarily capturing the animal and inducing it to regurgitate, researchers can assess the shark's diet and the overall health of the marine ecosystem. They hope this work will generate more support for the conservation of these vital predators.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is exploring the creation of a new political party, tentatively called the "America Party," which could strategically target a small number of congressional seats to gain decisive influence. He suggested that focusing on just a few key House and Senate races could be enough to act as the deciding vote on contentious legislation, given the current razor-thin margins in Congress. This idea follows a public falling out with President Trump over a major spending bill, which prompted Musk to threaten to challenge incumbents and form a new party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large new luxury beach resort in the city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic delays. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels, villas, and numerous amenities, reflecting Kim Jong Un's goal of boosting the nation's tourism-based economy. However, despite ambitions for it to be a "world destination," it is unclear if the resort will be open to most foreign visitors. For now, access appears limited to domestic tourists and small, controlled groups from allied Russia.</p>

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in his lease, a practice that is illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act. This act protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback about businesses without fear of retaliation or financial penalties. The case serves as a reminder that such "gag clauses" in contracts are unenforceable, and consumers have recourse through agencies like the FTC.</p>

The article explains that while many beneficiaries who cannot work should be exempt, issues like homelessness, lack of internet access, or cognitive disabilities will make it nearly impossible for them to navigate the system to prove their status. The author contends that these requirements effectively act as a gatekeeping device, designed to cut costs by disenrolling people who are entitled to care, ultimately leading to disastrous health outcomes.

          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to help manage difficult emotions. The concept, based on neuroscience, is that the physiological response to anger or stress, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously rerunning the triggering thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different response, rather than renewing the cycle of anger, thereby leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

This continues a trend, though the number is down from the previous year. The state's appeal is largely attributed to its tax-friendly policies, including no state income tax on Social Security or retirement account withdrawals, and no estate tax. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000 people in the same age group. (not investment advice)</p>
