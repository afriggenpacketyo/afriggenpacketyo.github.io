          <h2>Trump Reportedly Approved Iran Attack Plans But Awaits Final Decision</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to reports, Donald Trump has approved plans for a potential attack on Iran but is holding off on a final decision, possibly contingent on Iran abandoning its nuclear program. The reports indicate that a U.S. strike on Fordo, an underground uranium enrichment facility in Iran, is under consideration. This development comes as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. The news follows increased military activity in the region, with Israel reportedly launching attacks on Iranian missile sites and nuclear facilities, prompting Iran to respond with hypersonic missiles. The situation remains tense as both sides exchange threats and warnings. Optimism is low for immediate de-escalation given the current rhetoric and military posturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, urged the U.S. to consider the broader picture of trade relations, arguing that tariffs on Chinese imports remain unreasonably high and are hindering balanced trade. Xie stated that the U.S. goods deficit will persist as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place. He emphasized China's willingness to increase purchases from the U.S. but noted restrictions on exports of competitive U.S. products like semiconductors are impeding progress. This statement comes as a recently agreed framework to ease trade tensions hangs in limbo, highlighting ongoing challenges in the U.S.-China economic relationship. The overall outlook is uncertain due to existing trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Dongchoon Circus Troupe, South Korea's last and oldest circus, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon was a major form of entertainment during the 1960s, but the rise of television, movies, and the internet led to declining audiences. The circus has adapted by dropping animal acts and focusing on acrobatic performances, and all 35 acrobats are now Chinese due to a lack of South Koreans pursuing the profession. Head Park Sae-hwan hopes to establish a circus school to cultivate South Korean talent and ensure the circus's survival for another century. There is hope that the circus will be able to survive and continue to delight audiences for years to come.</p>

          <p>Thursday's newspaper headlines are dominated by speculation regarding potential U.S. strikes against Iran. The Metro warns of "ArmagedDon" and quotes Iran's threat of "irreparable harm" to the U.S. if attacks on nuclear sites occur. The Guardian notes Trump "keeps world waiting" on a decision, while the Financial Times highlights the U.S.'s capacity to destroy Iran's underground nuclear facilities. The Times reports the UK is considering military support for the U.S. in the event of strikes, while the Daily Telegraph says the Attorney General warned UK involvement could be illegal. The headlines reflect widespread international concern and uncertainty surrounding the escalating tensions. The outlook is tense as the world awaits Trump's decision.</p>

Sanders is competing against three other quarterbacks for the Browns’ starting position for the 2025 season. The incident does not necessarily affect the team's overall outlook, but it does reflect negatively on Sanders' judgement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will resume issuing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. This move follows a halt on interviews for "F," "M," and "J" visa applicants. Prospective students will be vetted for "hostile attitudes" toward U.S. citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. The changes are expected to burden embassy and consular staff, potentially reducing the volume of visa interviews. The administration has tightened standards for international students, citing alleged acts of anti-Semitism during student protests against Israel. The policy change introduces uncertainty for international students.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, during a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, jokingly questioned the immigration status of the construction workers. After discussing his administration's deportation efforts, Trump turned to the workers and asked if there were any "illegal immigrants" among them. The workers shook their heads, and Trump quipped about the potential consequences of their presence at the press conference. The remarks were made as Trump's administration intensifies its focus on immigration enforcement.

While the U.S. government supports Israel's defense efforts, it maintains it is not participating in the military conflict. However, President Trump has expressed that he is considering it.

          <p>According to a new report from Zillow, a home's interior paint colors can boost its sale price by almost $2,600. The hottest kitchen color is olive green, which can generate more buyer interest and potentially add $1,600 to the sale price. Classic navy walls are most desired in bedrooms, with buyers willing to pay an estimated $1,815 more for a home featuring this color. Dark gray is preferred in living rooms, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors can decrease a home's sale price.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering materials or dimensions to fit into different product classifications. This legal practice involves strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements, switching to cotton materials, and adding cubic zirconia to products. Companies must tread a fine line between redesigning products and fraudulently misrepresenting classifications. The practice of tariff engineering can be traced back to 1882. This shows how businesses are adapting to changing trade policies.</p>

Consumers are urged to immediately stop using the recalled fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement. The minifridges were sold online from June 2019 through June 2022.

The Dallas-based firm described the move as the "largest investment in foundational semiconductor manufacturing in US history." It follows similar announcements from others manufacturing semiconductors, including Micron, which said last week that it would increase its planned spending in the US to $200bn.

          <p>Hurricane Erick strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane as it approached the southern Mexico coast, threatening destructive winds, flash floods, and a dangerous storm surge. With maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, Erick was moving northwest toward an expected landfall. The projected path would take its center near Acapulco, which was devastated by Hurricane Otis in 2023. Residents and authorities are taking precautions, including closing beaches and preparing shelters. The hurricane is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and a fierce storm surge to Mexico's Pacific coast. There is concern due to the potential for damage.</p>

          <p>As Beijing looks to shore up China’s economic growth amid mounting challenges, Premier Li Qiang has called on Jiangsu province, a key manufacturing hub on the country’s east coast, to step up its efforts in technology, trade and consumption. During a three-day visit to the province from Monday, Li emphasised the importance of embracing innovative development, stimulating effective demand, fostering entrepreneurship, and deepening reform and opening up to support China’s sustained economic growth. One of China’s most advanced manufacturing provinces, Jiangsu has been tasked by Beijing with playing a leading role in stabilising growth amid sluggish domestic demand and growing external pressure from increased US tariffs. At a factory that makes machinery, Li highlighted the need to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence and clean energy technologies to upgrade traditional industries and keep pace with global manufacturing trends.

          <p>Israel's military warned people to evacuate the area around Iran's Arak heavy water reactor via a social media post. This warning comes amidst ongoing airstrikes on Iran, targeting locations related to the country's nuclear program. The Arak heavy water reactor is located 250 kilometers southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors but produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. The situation remains tense.</p>
