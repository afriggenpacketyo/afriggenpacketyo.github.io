          <p>During the Trump administration, the Justice Department experienced a reduction of 4,000 employees due to a government downsizing initiative, resulting in an estimated savings of $470 million. Further cuts are planned, including the elimination of 1,500 positions within the FBI, which includes over 700 vacant agent positions. Critics are concerned that these cuts will negatively impact safety within U.S. communities, draining the department of experienced agents and leaders. The Justice Department also plans to shutter the Community Relations Service, an office founded during the civil rights era, which is raising concerns about the agency's ability to resolve racial and ethnic tensions.

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, reversing course after completing only 65 miles of the proposed barrier. Governor Greg Abbott's office cited President Trump's efforts to secure the border as the reason for the adjustment. The new budget allocates $3.4 billion for border security, directing funds to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard instead of new wall projects. The halt in funding reflects a shift in priorities and a reassessment of the need for the wall amid declining migrant crossings.

Trapped peafowl will be sent to screened homes off the peninsula, ensuring they are not euthanized or treated inhumanely.
