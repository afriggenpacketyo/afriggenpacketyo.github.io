          <p>An inquest jury has determined that 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz was unlawfully killed at a mental health hospital in Maidenhead, Berkshire, after being left unsupervised. Ruth, who was being treated for an eating disorder, was left alone for approximately 15 minutes by a staff member who had secured his job with fraudulent credentials and was on his first shift. The jury concluded that factors contributing to her death included insufficient staff training and care conditions that were not conducive to her recovery, highlighting severe systemic failures at the now-closed facility.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, fell by 15% after it announced that increased U.S. tariffs would significantly reduce its profits in the next fiscal year. The company anticipates a $160 million negative impact from higher duties, partly due to the suspension of the 'de minimis' rule that exempted items under $800 from tariffs. Despite forecasting sales growth, Tapestry provided a conservative earnings outlook, signaling that geopolitical trade policies are creating substantial financial headwinds for the luxury goods retailer.

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. has decreased to 6.58%, its lowest level since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declining rates, offering a measure of relief to potential homebuyers facing affordability challenges in a sluggish housing market. The drop is largely influenced by a decrease in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon cut its key interest rate, although concerns about inflation persist.

          <p>The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, surged by 0.9% in July, significantly exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This marks the largest monthly gain since June 2022 and suggests that inflationary pressures may still pose a threat to the economy. The unexpected spike in costs for producers could complicate the Federal Reserve's decision-making regarding potential interest rate cuts, as there are concerns businesses may begin passing these higher costs on to consumers.

          <p>Agricultural machinery giant John Deere has warned that it expects tariffs to cost the company nearly $600 million in fiscal year 2025, contributing to a significant drop in its stock price. The announcement came alongside its third-quarter earnings report, which showed year-over-year declines in net income and sales, though results still beat analyst expectations. The company attributed the decreased operating profits primarily to higher tariff-related production costs, highlighting the substantial financial strain that current trade policies are placing on major U.S. manufacturers.

          <p>President Trump has characterized Washington, D.C., as a city overrun by crime to justify federalizing its police and deploying the National Guard, but this portrayal conflicts with official data. Federal statistics show that violent crime in the district has actually fallen to a three-decade low, a reversal of the spike seen in 2023. Despite the data, polls indicate many residents and a majority of Republicans perceive crime as a worsening problem, highlighting a significant gap between statistical reality and public feeling that influences political strategy and policy debates.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has begun suspending flights after its flight attendants' union, CUPE, issued a 72-hour strike notice following an impasse in contract negotiations. The union, which represents 10,000 attendants, stated that the airline has failed to address key issues like wages and unpaid work. The potential strike, set to begin Saturday, could disrupt travel for 130,000 customers daily during the peak summer season, prompting the airline to warn passengers and the Canadian government to urge both sides to resume bargaining.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's are reporting a decline in breakfast sales, which executives attribute to economic uncertainty and financial pressure on low-income consumers. As people rein in discretionary spending, breakfast is often the first meal to be cut, with many opting for home-prepared options or skipping it entirely. This trend, coupled with rising fast-food prices, points to broader economic anxieties, including the impact of tariffs and a weakening labor market, causing consumers to become more selective with their spending.

The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, and the resulting compounds proved effective in laboratory and animal tests. While these potential drugs are still years away from clinical use, the breakthrough demonstrates that AI can accelerate the discovery of entirely new medicines, potentially heralding a new era in the fight against antibiotic resistance.</p>
