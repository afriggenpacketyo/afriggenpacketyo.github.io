          <p>The Trump administration ruled that the University of Pennsylvania violated Title IX by allowing male athletes to compete in women's sports, specifically citing Lia Thomas' participation on the women's swim team. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights demands UPenn restore honors to female athletes and issue an apology for allowing sex discrimination in athletics. This decision follows testimony from Paula Scanlan, a former teammate of Thomas, who detailed the challenges faced by female athletes. The administration's action underscores its stance on biological males competing in women's sports, potentially jeopardizing UPenn's federal funding if it doesn't comply. </p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers, led by Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Mike Levin, are urging the White House to disclose financial transactions leading up to President Trump's recent pause on tariffs.

          <p>Apollo Global Management predicts that President Trump's trade policies, including tariffs, will lead to a recession in the U.S. this summer. The firm's chief economist, Torsten Slok, outlined a timeline suggesting that empty shelves and trucking layoffs will precede the economic downturn. The report indicates that the impact of the tariffs will become apparent to everyday Americans, leading to Covid-like shortages. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has acknowledged the tariff standoff is unsustainable, but some analysts believe there may be a "pull-forward" in orders that could delay the predicted shortages.
