          <p>Five senior executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded company operating strip clubs, have been indicted in New York for an alleged multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme. The indictment, announced by Attorney General Letitia James, claims the executives bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips and private dances to avoid over $8 million in taxes. The scheme allegedly involved the company's CEO, CFO, and other top managers, leading to a significant drop in RCI's stock price following the announcement. The company and the indicted individuals deny the allegations and intend to defend themselves in court.</p>

In messages to a group of friends, an account belonging to Robinson took responsibility for the shooting at Utah Valley University, ending a nearly two-day manhunt. The company stated that their internal investigation found no evidence the suspect had planned the attack or promoted violence on their platform beforehand. Robinson was subsequently taken into custody on multiple charges, including aggravated murder, after his father reportedly confronted him.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been formally charged with aggravated murder and other offenses for the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, with Utah prosecutors announcing their intent to seek the death penalty. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed to his parents, stating he committed the act because Kirk "spreads too much hate." The documents also reveal that Robinson had informed his roommate of his plans in a note and later texted that he'd "had enough of his hatred." The investigation continues as authorities examine the suspect's electronic devices and conversations on the Discord platform for further evidence and potential accomplices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, pushing the date to December 16th. This fourth extension comes as a framework deal is reportedly being finalized, which would see an investor consortium including Oracle and Silver Lake take ownership of the U.S. business. The agreement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. Under the proposed structure, existing U.S. users would need to migrate to a new application, and the deal is expected to close within the next 30 to 45 days.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut this week, a decision influenced by a softening labor market and significant political pressure from the White House. The meeting is notable for the inclusion of new Trump appointee Stephen Miran, who may dissent in favor of a more aggressive reduction. While markets have largely priced in the cut, the central bank's updated economic forecasts and Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference will be closely watched for signals about the future direction of monetary policy.

This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in San Mateo County and San Francisco but previously lacked airport access.

The bipartisan law requires TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns.

          <p>In response to growing concerns about political violence, highlighted by the recent murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Republicans are proposing an additional $30 million for security funding. The measure, included in a stopgap government funding bill, would supplement an existing program that reimburses local law enforcement for protecting lawmakers in their home districts. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed heightened fear and are adjusting their public activities, with some canceling outdoor events. The U.S. Capitol Police report they are on track to handle approximately 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump Seeks Near-Total Control Over U.S. Economy Through Supreme Court Cases</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is attempting to gain unprecedented control over U.S. fiscal and monetary policy through three key cases before the Supreme Court. These cases involve the legality of his tariffs, his power to impound congressionally appropriated funds, and his ability to fire a Federal Reserve governor. If the court rules in his favor, the author contends, Trump could effectively tax, spend, and manipulate the economy by decree, bypassing congressional authority. The article warns that the Republican-majority court has shown deference to Trump, creating a real risk that it will grant him these sweeping and potentially dictatorial economic powers.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where he clashed repeatedly with Democratic senators over his handling of several high-profile investigations. Patel defended his management of the probe into Charlie Kirk's assassination and revealed that many more individuals involved in a Discord chat with the suspect will be interrogated. He also addressed the Jeffrey Epstein case and hinted at future crime crackdowns in cities like Chicago, Miami, and St. Louis. The hearing was marked by partisan shouting matches, with Democrats accusing Patel of politicizing the FBI, while he dismissed their criticisms as baseless.</p>

          <p>A former bus driver for Student Transportation of America in Jacksonville, Florida, has been arrested on charges of lewd conduct with a student and unlawful use of a two-way communication device. Gregory Strigglers, 31, is accused of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student who rode his bus. The investigation began after the victim's aunt discovered incriminating text messages and reported the incident. Strigglers turned himself in to police and reportedly claimed he believed the victim was 21 years old. The victim's aunt expressed relief at the arrest, stating she will attend all court dates to ensure accountability.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars' worth of unexpired contraceptives, intended for women in low-income countries, have been stranded in a Belgian warehouse due to the Trump administration's freeze on foreign aid. The State Department had announced plans to incinerate the $9.7 million stockpile, characterizing the products as "abortifacients," a claim disputed by humanitarian groups. Despite conflicting reports, the contraceptives have not yet been destroyed, leaving aid organizations cautiously optimistic that they can still be distributed. These groups warn that destroying the supplies could lead to hundreds of thousands of unintended pregnancies and preventable maternal deaths in Africa.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 71-year-old man, George Zinn, for allegedly obstructing justice by falsely confessing to the murder of Charlie Kirk immediately after the shooting at Utah Valley University. Police documents state Zinn screamed, "I shot him – now shoot me," in what he later claimed was an effort to become a "martyr" and allow the real killer to escape. Zinn was detained at the scene, leading to initial public confusion about the suspect's identity. He now faces a felony charge for the false confession, as well as separate charges related to child sexual abuse material allegedly found on his cellphone.</p>

The move comes as the pharmaceutical industry faces potential tariffs from the Trump administration.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promised to investigate the causes of rising autism rates, should seriously consider the role of environmental factors like pesticides. While Kennedy's focus has been on other potential causes, a body of scientific research has found associations between pesticide exposure during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental impacts in children. The author suggests that a genuine effort to understand autism's causes would require funding long-term studies into various environmental exposures, including pesticides, air pollution, and PFAS chemicals. This approach would align with Kennedy's past rhetoric against agricultural chemicals, which has been muted since he took office.</p>

          <p>The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Brian Mast, has withdrawn a controversial provision from a State Department reform bill that would have given the Secretary of State broad authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens. The measure would have allowed passport revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations, which civil liberties advocates warned could be used to target pro-Palestinian activists. Following widespread criticism, a committee spokesperson stated the provision was being removed to prevent it from overshadowing the bill's other bipartisan reform efforts. The amendment to remove the language requires committee approval.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 21 unions and faculty associations representing over 100,000 University of California employees has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The suit alleges that the government's suspension of research grants and a proposed $1.2-billion fine against UCLA constitute illegal financial coercion and violate free speech and due process rights. The plaintiffs argue the administration is attempting to impose "ideological dominance" over the university system by threatening its federal funding. This legal action was initiated by employees who felt the UC administration was not acting quickly enough to counter what they call federal extortion.</p>

          <p>Despite legalizing recreational marijuana to reduce drug-related policing, states like Connecticut and California are now increasing arrests to crack down on a surge of illegal dispensaries. These unlicensed shops often look identical to legal ones but bypass regulations, avoid taxes, and may sell untested products or sell to minors. Law enforcement officials warn that some illegal operations are also linked to more serious criminal enterprises, including organized crime. While some drug-policy advocates argue for more inclusive licensing and fines instead of arrests, repeated busts of the same shops suggest that regulatory measures alone have been ineffective.</p>
