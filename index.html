          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:26:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The largest U.S. rail workers' union, SMART-TD, plans to challenge the proposed $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The union cites significant concerns over Union Pacific's labor practices and a "troubling safety record," alleging a corporate culture that prioritizes profits over worker and public safety. SMART-TD will present its case to the Surface Transportation Board, contrasting Union Pacific's record with what it describes as more progressive policies at Norfolk Southern. Other unions have also raised concerns about Union Pacific's practices, including replacing American crews with Mexican national crews at the border.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw its stock price plummet after announcing a new CEO and reducing its 2025 sales and profit forecasts. The company attributed the lowered outlook to increased competition from compounded, or copycat, versions of its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. Despite FDA orders for compounding pharmacies to cease sales, these cheaper alternatives continue to saturate the market. The incoming CEO, Maziar Mike Doustdar, will take over as the company pursues litigation to protect patients from what it calls illicit 'semaglutide' drugs.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs are demanding his release from jail pending his October sentencing on federal transportation charges. In a new petition, the defense team argues that Combs' conviction, which relates to arranging for adult male escorts for himself and his girlfriend, stems from a consensual "swingers" lifestyle and does not warrant his continued incarceration. They proposed a $50 million bail package, secured by his Miami mansion. A judge previously denied bail, citing concerns for community safety based on Combs' admissions of violence in his personal relationships.</p>

          <p>Three private seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for £500,000 in damages against the venue's operator. The claimants argued that the corporation unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted under the historic rules governing their privately-owned seats. A judge dismissed the request for a summary judgment, stating that the complexities of the case and the history of the dispute require a full trial. The case highlights the unique 999-year lease system where 1,268 of the hall's seats remain in private ownership.</p>

          <p>President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast has confirmed he will seek a controversial fourth term in the upcoming October presidential election. The 83-year-old former banker, in power since 2011, claims the country's constitution permits another run, a point heavily disputed by the opposition. His previous third-term bid in 2020, which followed a constitutional change, was boycotted by opponents and led to deadly unrest. The announcement raises tensions, especially as prominent opposition candidates have been legally barred from running, fueling accusations that the government is suppressing rivals.</p>

A CBS News analysis suggests this decline is driven by less partisan and politically independent young voters who initially gave him the benefit of the doubt. Key factors appear to be a growing belief that he is not fulfilling campaign promises and rising dissatisfaction with the economy. Majorities of young people now feel his policies are making them worse off financially and that his administration is focusing on the wrong issues.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a law permitting citizens over 60 to voluntarily join the military, expanding the recruitment pool amid ongoing manpower shortages. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has acknowledged a new, shortened ceasefire ultimatum from U.S. President Donald Trump, who now demands progress toward peace in 10-12 days to avoid further sanctions. In other developments, Ukrainian officials condemned a deadly Russian strike on a prison near Zaporizhzhia as a war crime, and missile strikes killed civilians in the Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions.</p>

          <p>A recently passed tax and spending bill is making affordable housing development more attractive to investors and developers. The legislation expands and enhances the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), the primary tool for financing such projects, which is expected to help produce over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, developers see a growing opportunity in the sector. However, the industry faces potential headwinds from proposed cuts to federal rental assistance programs and persistent local opposition ("NIMBYism") to new developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While Donald Trump's Turnberry resort is unlikely to host The Open Championship due to infrastructure limitations, he is successfully increasing his golf footprint in Scotland through other means. The European Tour Group has scheduled two professional tournaments at his Aberdeen course and is reportedly considering his Irish resort, Doonbeg, for the Irish Open. This strategic pivot allows Trump to gain prestige for his properties without needing the R&A's approval for The Open. This quiet integration into the European golf ecosystem suggests his influence in the sport is growing, despite the political optics.</p>

          <p>A new alert from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative warns that the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out" in the Gaza Strip. The report states there is mounting evidence that mass starvation, malnutrition, and disease are causing a rise in hunger-related deaths among the 2.1 million Palestinians. It notes that famine thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have already been met in parts of the territory. UN agencies blame the crisis on Israel's blockade and military offensive, calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian aid.</p>

The payout figure was revealed in the trust's annual report, which states the money will be used to enhance the collection.

          <p>A German court has convicted three men for the 2022 theft of 483 ancient Celtic gold coins from a museum in Manching, Bavaria. The defendants received prison sentences of up to 11 years for the audacious heist, which took only nine minutes to execute. The stolen treasure, dating to around 100 B.C., was considered the largest trove of Celtic gold discovered in the 20th century. Most of the coins remain missing, and investigators fear they have been melted down, as lumps of gold were found on one of the suspects upon his arrest.</p>

          <p>As warnings of catastrophic hunger escalate in Gaza, this article explains the physiological process of starvation. The body first uses its carbohydrate stores, then transitions to burning fat, and finally begins breaking down its own muscle and organ proteins for energy. This final, fatal stage leads to a weakened immune system, organ failure, and often death from infection or cardiac arrest. Children, pregnant people, and the elderly are most vulnerable, with children at risk of dying within a week without food. Experts emphasize that the treatment is simple—food and water—but access is the critical barrier in crisis zones.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency has proposed revoking the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. This finding has served as the legal basis for nearly all major U.S. climate regulations under the Clean Air Act, including limits on emissions from vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the move the "largest deregulatory action in the history of America," while critics, including former EPA leaders and environmental groups, have labeled it dangerous, illegal, and a breach of the agency's mission, vowing to challenge it in court.</p>

The anonymous art dealer who purchased it discovered it had been previously attributed and sold in the 1990s but had since lost its attribution.
