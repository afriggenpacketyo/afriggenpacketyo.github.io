          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new $100,000 annual fee per worker for H-1B visas, a program crucial for the U.S. technology and finance sectors. This move has caused significant concern among major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase, which are advising their visa-holding employees to avoid international travel. The policy, representing a major escalation in restricting legal immigration, has also prompted foreign governments, particularly India, to express concerns over potential humanitarian and economic consequences for their skilled workers.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a Leicester, North Carolina resident named John Saunby is constructing a new home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. Instead of letting the debris go to a landfill, Saunby has repurposed items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards to build his dream house, incorporating unique elements like Black Locust bark siding. This project represents a personal and creative vision of resilience, turning the destructive aftermath of a natural disaster into a source of treasure and renewal.</p>

Despite a resilient French team that kept the contest close, particularly in the first half, England's powerful performance after the interval ultimately secured their decisive win in front of a large home crowd.</p>

Climate activists, organized by Fridays for Future, protested the government's new energy policy that includes building more gas-fired power plants. Simultaneously, thousands participated in opposing rallies concerning abortion rights, with both "March for Life" anti-abortion demonstrators and pro-choice counter-protesters making their voices heard in Berlin and Cologne.

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air temporarily following comments the host made regarding the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), publicly commented on Kimmel's remarks. This suspension is being interpreted by some observers as part of a broader crackdown on dissent by the current administration, signaling a shift in the perceived rules for media engagement and political commentary.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a provider of check-in and baggage software, has caused widespread disruption at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin-Brandenburg. The incident forced airlines to revert to manual check-in and boarding procedures, leading to long queues and numerous flight delays on Saturday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre is working with the affected company to understand the full impact, which highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to digital threats.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques the new, thinner iPhone Air as an emblem of a pervasive and "miserable" minimalist aesthetic dominating technology, design, and culture. The author argues that this trend toward spartan, unobtrusive design, seen in everything from iPhones to interior decorating and theater, represents a loss of creativity and personality. Contrasting it with the colorful, maximalist designs of the past like the 1998 iMac, the piece suggests that modern minimalism is a hollow attempt to control a chaotic world, ultimately leaving us feeling isolated.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Military Adopts a Quieter Approach to Announcing Warship Transits Through Taiwan Strait</h2>

          <p>The United States appears to have shifted its strategy regarding freedom of navigation operations, becoming less public about its warships transiting the Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. Under the previous administration, these transits were regularly announced as a clear signal to Beijing, which often condemned the "public hype." While the U.S. still confirms the operations when asked, this new, lower-profile approach is seen by some Chinese observers as a tactical shift rather than a substantive change in American policy in the region.</p>

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) rays even while indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. This "silent" exposure can occur without any visible signs like a burn. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially if spending extended time near windows.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices rising at their fastest monthly rate since 2022. According to food industry analysts, three primary factors are contributing to this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods, the effects of climate change disrupting domestic agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers in the U.S. As a result, companies are passing on higher costs to consumers, sometimes through "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced while prices remain stable.
