          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. assistance to Argentina, specifically a $20 billion currency swap, is contingent on Javier Milei's party winning the upcoming midterm elections. Milei, Argentina's libertarian leader, praised Trump's policies and sought U.S. support amidst Argentina's financial instability. Trump explicitly connected the financial aid to Milei's electoral prospects, a move that has drawn scrutiny. The article further explains that the currency swap was intended to stabilize the peso, but markets appear unconvinced that Trump's endorsement will significantly boost Milei's chances, especially given public fatigue with austerity measures.

          <p>Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed President Trump's remark that he isn't "the easiest guy to deal with," stating he hopes it's because he is tough on matters concerning Israel's future. Netanyahu invoked the history of Jewish persecution and his role in ensuring the Jewish state's safety, including actions against Iran. Trump's initial comment was followed by praise for Netanyahu's job, indicating a complex but ultimately positive view. Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect Israel, even if it means disagreeing with allies.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Hamas must disarm or face consequences, following a peace deal brokered by the Trump administration. The deal secured the release of living Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but Netanyahu insists that demilitarization is the next crucial step. Trump echoed this sentiment, warning of swift and potentially violent disarmament if Hamas refuses. Netanyahu expressed hope for a peaceful resolution and highlighted the Abraham Accords as evidence of his desire for broader regional peace.</p>

Trump praised Kirk's impact in mobilizing young Americans and condemned "far-left radicals" for political violence.

          <p>Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee, is facing scrutiny after attacking her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, over his alleged connection to the opioid crisis. Sherrill has received donations from companies linked to the opioid crisis, raising questions about her stance. Ciattarelli's campaign has accused Sherrill of hypocrisy, citing her acceptance of funds from pharmaceutical companies. Sherrill's campaign defended her record, highlighting her efforts to combat the opioid crisis, but did not address the donations.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in La Cañada Flintridge is experiencing its lowest morale in decades after laying off 550 employees. The layoffs, part of a reorganization, reduced the workforce by over 10% and affected teams across the institution. The cuts were prompted by federal budget cuts and challenges with the Mars Sample Return mission. The agency has seen its staffing reduced by about one-third in the last two years.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to end cooking oil trade with China in retaliation for Beijing's refusal to buy U.S. soybeans. Trump accused China of committing an "Economically Hostile Act" that harms American soybean farmers. China, the top buyer of U.S. soybeans, has not made any purchases since May due to trade war tariffs. Trump suggested the U.S. can easily produce cooking oil domestically and does not need to rely on Chinese imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Americans' views on the economy vary significantly based on income, with higher-income earners expressing greater confidence. JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey reveals a notable bifurcation, with high-income respondents rating their confidence at 6.2 out of 10, compared to 4.4 for low-income consumers. This disparity is also evident in the ability to cover monthly bills and plans for future spending. The top one-third of earners have reported consumer sentiment ratings that are 25% higher than the lowest one-third.</p>
