            <p>The article discusses how commerce and entrepreneurial capitalism have been crucial in reducing global poverty. It highlights China's economic transformation since 1990, lifting 800 million people out of extreme poverty by opening up to the global economy. The piece notes that globalization and increased international trade have coincided with the most rapid progress against extreme poverty. However, it also acknowledges the downsides of globalization, such as rising greenhouse gas emissions and social disruption in developed countries, while emphasizing the significant upside of lifting millions out of poverty. The article also briefly touches on the polio vaccine and declining plastic pollution in Australia. </p>

Words like "bonkers," "queue," and "cheeky" are becoming more common in American usage. Researchers attribute this to cultural globalization and increased exposure to UK television, films, and music.

            <p>A Lebanese-American attorney, Amir Makled, alleges he was targeted and searched at the Detroit Metro airport upon returning from vacation, due to his work representing a pro-Palestinian student protester. Immigration officials reportedly knew his profession and recent cases, demanding to search his phone, which contained privileged client information. Makled felt compelled to provide his contact list after being threatened with confiscation of his device. Customs and Border Protection denies the claims, stating it was a routine secondary inspection and Makled consented to a limited search.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi expressed the country's desire for a "fair agreement". These discussions mark a significant step, especially given President Trump's withdrawal from the previous Obama-era nuclear agreement in 2018. While it remains uncertain whether the two sides will engage in direct, face-to-face meetings, the current focus is on establishing a framework for future negotiations. The US President sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader via the United Arab Emirates, saying he wanted a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible military strikes by the US and Israel.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs aim to protect American jobs by making foreign goods more expensive, but they also raise prices for U.S. consumers. A Penn State economist notes that while import competition from China has led to job losses in certain manufacturing sectors, it has also provided Americans with more affordable goods. The article highlights the trade-off between preserving domestic jobs and maintaining access to cheaper products, a central debate in Trump's trade policy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is using a plan from the Heritage Foundation called Project Esther to justify arresting and deporting pro-Palestinian protesters, falsely labeling them as "Hamas supporters." Project Esther, written by evangelical Christians, calls for cracking down on antisemitism by rebranding pro-Palestinian supporters as Hamas supporters and deporting student visa holders who criticize Israel. Critics argue that this plan conflates criticism of Israel with antisemitism, stokes antisemitism, and undermines constitutional protections.</p>

            <p>A community in Valparai, India, has implemented an innovative solution to protect both residents and wildlife by deploying "invisible" solar-powered fencing. The system uses individual posts equipped with sensors that trigger alarms and flashing lights when animals approach, alerting residents to potential dangers. This initiative aims to reduce human-animal conflict, particularly with elephants, which have been involved in numerous lethal interactions with humans in India. While there have been some issues with the system's functionality, it represents a promising approach to coexistence between humans and wildlife.</p>

            <p>Beijing and northern China are experiencing strong winds, leading to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the suspension of train lines.

Residents have been advised to stay indoors, and authorities are working to reinforce or trim old trees. The strong winds are expected to continue through the weekend, originating from a cold vortex system over Mongolia.</p>

            <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian student activist at Columbia University, has been ruled eligible for deportation from the US, despite holding a green card and having a US citizen wife. The Trump administration claims his participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and his views are antisemitic and "pro-Hamas". Khalil's lawyers plan to fight the ruling, arguing it violates his right to due process and suppresses dissent. His case highlights the administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters at universities and the weaponization of immigration law.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles is experiencing a decline in tourism due to the Trump administration's tariff policies and fears surrounding deportations. The tariffs are expected to raise prices on goods, impacting businesses, and the deportation threats have deterred international visitors, particularly from Canada and Mexico. Local hoteliers are concerned about the negative perception of the U.S. and the potential for conferences and travel expenses to be cut. The tourism industry, a major employer in Los Angeles, is bracing for a slowdown in growth.</p>

            <p>The article reflects on Stephen A. Smith's potential presidential run, emphasizing the importance of policy substance over celebrity appeal. It contrasts Smith's vague promises to fix "this mess" with Franklin D. Roosevelt's clear articulation of policies during the Great Depression. The author argues that governing requires more than a big personality and that voters should demand real solutions, not just hot takes. The article suggests that Smith should emulate Roosevelt's ability to connect with the public through well-defined policies, rather than relying on personal attacks or campaign slogans.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that migrants have the right to a hearing before being deported, limiting President Trump's power to arrest and quickly deport individuals alleged to be members of foreign crime gangs. The court emphasized the importance of due process, ensuring that those facing deportation have the opportunity to challenge their removal before a federal judge. While the ruling is likely to slow the pace of deportations, it does not stop them entirely, and questions remain about the administration's compliance with the court's orders.</p>

            <p>Ecuador's upcoming presidential election is critical as the country grapples with record levels of drug gang violence and a struggling economy. The election is a rematch between incumbent Daniel Noboa and Luisa González, with voters primarily concerned about combating narco-fueled violence. Noboa has relied on the military and sought foreign assistance, while González advocates for more social spending and technology. The next president will face the challenge of addressing rising crime with limited resources and a divided National Assembly.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that crows possess geometric intuition, distinguishing shapes with geometric regularity from those without. This is the first time a species other than humans has demonstrated this capability. Researchers tested crows' ability to identify outlier shapes in a group, finding they could discern squares from irregular quadrilaterals. This suggests that geometric abilities may be more widespread in the animal kingdom than previously thought and that human geometric abilities may build on precursor capabilities present in other species.</p>
