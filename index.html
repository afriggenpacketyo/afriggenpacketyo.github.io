        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released new guidelines for approving future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, imposing stricter standards for healthy Americans. The agency now requires new clinical trials to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Covid shots before approving them for healthy adults and children. This contrasts with the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response tests. The FDA will use immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals but demands randomized, controlled trials showing clinical outcomes for healthy individuals, reflecting a balance between regulatory flexibility and rigorous scientific standards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The availability of EU e-gates for UK passport holders this summer remains uncertain, as the EU Commission indicates that access will not be granted until the new European Entry/Exit Scheme (EES) is implemented in October 2025. Even after the EES is in place, individual countries will decide whether to allow UK citizens to use e-gates. The EES gathers biometric data on citizens from non-EU countries, including the UK, to enhance border security. While the UK and EU have agreed there will be "no legal barriers" to eGate use after the EES introduction, talks with individual EU nations are ongoing to potentially allow British passengers to use e-gates sooner.</p>

          <p>CNN's Jake Tapper, in his new book 'Original Sin,' co-authored with Axios' Alex Thompson, depicts a concerning decline in former President Joe Biden's cognitive abilities during his term. The book describes instances where Biden failed to recognize political allies, lost his train of thought, and forgot important dates, suggesting that the public was largely unaware of the extent of his deterioration. Tapper expresses regret for not covering Biden's health issues more aggressively, emphasizing the importance of addressing questions about a president's health. The book's release coincides with Biden's recent diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading a coalition of environmental groups and MAGA supporters to push for stricter regulations on the weedkiller atrazine.

          <p>Elon Musk announced plans to significantly reduce his political spending, stating that he does not currently see a reason to invest further in politics. This decision comes after contributing at least $277 million to Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 cycle. Musk, who was tasked by President Trump to informally oversee the Department of Government Efficiency, has faced scrutiny for his leadership in government cuts. Tesla, one of his companies, has suffered a 71% drop in net income in the first quarter. However, Musk has also seen benefits for his other companies, such as Starlink, which has been approved for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

Walmart's CFO stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than any retailer can absorb. The company's shift in tone reflects a growing willingness among corporate leaders to publicly criticize Trump's trade policies, as tariffs directly affect business operations and consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Israel has retrieved thousands of items belonging to Eli Cohen, its most famous spy, after a covert operation in Syria. The recovered items include documents, recordings, photos, and letters collected by Syrian intelligence after Cohen's capture in 1965. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared some of the 2,500 items with Cohen's widow, Nadia Cohen, marking 60 years since his execution in Damascus. Cohen, who infiltrated the Syrian political echelon, is credited with providing intelligence that helped Israel prepare for the 1967 Middle East War.</p>

          <p>The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art has laid off 15 full-time employees, including members of the education and public programming team, amounting to 14% of its full-time staff. The layoffs were attributed to a necessary shift in the institution's focus to ensure it opens on time next year, now scheduled for 2026. The museum's director and chief executive, Sandra Jackson-Dumont, stepped down earlier this year, and sources suggest that George Lucas has been more involved in curatorial decisions than in education and public programming.
