          <p>The United States has suspended live cattle imports from Mexico due to the spread of the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that poses a threat to livestock. This ban, arriving after two years of severe drought, is devastating for Mexican ranchers, particularly in Sonora, who heavily rely on exports to the U.S. market. Now facing significant financial losses, ranchers are forced to sell cattle at a steep discount within Mexico and diversify into other ventures like beekeeping to survive the economic crisis.</p>

A gigantic wave of water and debris crashed down from the mountains, submerging roads and buildings, which has severely hampered rescue operations. Continuous heavy rains and damaged infrastructure are further complicating efforts by the army and disaster response forces to reach the affected area and account for the missing, which includes at least 10 soldiers.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has opted to keep its key policy interest rate steady at 5.5%, a decision that was widely anticipated by economists. This move occurs as India navigates rising trade tensions with the U.S., including threats of higher tariffs from President Trump over India's ties with Russia. Following an aggressive rate cut in its previous meeting, the central bank has now adopted a "neutral" stance, signaling it will carefully evaluate incoming economic data before determining future policy actions.

          <p>A high-ranking UN official has warned the Security Council about the "catastrophic consequences" of a potential full Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. The caution follows reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a plan for the complete conquest of Gaza, a strategy that is reportedly divisive even within Israel's military leadership. The official stressed that such an expansion would further endanger Palestinian civilians and the remaining Israeli hostages, while reiterating calls for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, creating a new obstacle for its post-war reconstruction efforts. Although bilateral trade is minimal due to long-standing sanctions, analysts suggest the move is largely symbolic, signaling continued U.S. leverage over Syria's new transitional government. This economic pressure could hinder crucial foreign investment and aid needed to rebuild the nation's shattered infrastructure and prevent further collapse after years of devastating civil war.

Indiana played without its star rookie Caitlin Clark, who was sidelined due to a right groin injury but remained an active presence, coaching from the bench. The Sparks, who are now enjoying a fully healthy roster for the first time in over a year, were led by strong offensive performances from Rickea Jackson, Kelsey Plum, and Azurá Stevens, improving their position for a playoff berth.</p>

          <p>Italy's cabinet has passed draft legislation that aims to tighten controls over medical treatments related to gender transition for individuals under the age of 18. The proposed law would mandate that medications like puberty blockers and hormones be dispensed only after approval by a national ethics committee. The measure, which also establishes a national registry to monitor treatments, is presented by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government as a means to protect minors' health but has sparked protests from transgender rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Lebanon's government has instructed its army to formulate a plan by the end of the year to ensure only state institutions possess weapons, a directive aimed squarely at disarming the powerful militant group Hezbollah. This decision follows intense pressure from the United States and is a key component of a 2024 ceasefire agreement with Israel. However, Hezbollah's leadership has already rejected the notion, stating the group will not disarm while facing Israeli attacks, setting the stage for a major political and security confrontation.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its stock slide in extended trading after reporting second-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Although the company's revenue of $7.69 billion exceeded forecasts, its adjusted earnings per share were slightly below the consensus estimate. The company noted that its AI business revenue declined, partly due to U.S. export restrictions to China, but it projects that AI-related sales will grow in the upcoming quarter.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction to stop the Trump administration from reallocating more than $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funding. The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued after the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge determined that redirecting the funds, which are meant for projects like flood mitigation, could inflict "irreparable harm" on vulnerable communities and that the administration failed to show Congress authorized the transfer.</p>

Combs was recently convicted on prostitution-related offenses and is currently awaiting sentencing in October, where he could face up to 20 years in prison. When questioned about it, President Trump confirmed he had been approached but appeared hesitant to grant a pardon, citing that Combs was "very hostile" towards him during his political campaign.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mine in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making substantial progress toward starting extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine project, first awarded in 2008, has been delayed for 17 years by security challenges, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. A recent decision by the Taliban to switch to underground mining, a method more protective of historical relics, may have cleared a major hurdle for production to finally commence.</p>

This data confirms a continuing downward trend from the crime spike seen immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic, although experts note that aggravated assault rates remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels.</p>
