          <p>This article highlights two uplifting stories of generosity submitted by viewers. In one instance, a Wyoming man whose car was hit by a teenager on an icy road raised nearly $14,000 to buy her a replacement vehicle. In another story, two young brothers who are chess champions in Washington decided to donate their tournament winnings to help a 10-year-old boy suffering from chronic pancreatitis. Both acts of kindness provided significant emotional and practical support to the recipients, underscoring the positive impact of community and compassion.</p>

          <p>At least 90 people, including young campers and a father who died saving his family, lost their lives in the historic flash floods that devastated central Texas. The article shares the stories of some of the victims, such as a camp counselor remembered for her contagious joy and a camp director who died trying to save campers. These personal accounts provide a somber look at the human toll of the disaster, remembering the individuals who were cherished members of their communities before the tragedy struck over the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the 22 emergency warnings issued by the National Weather Service for Kerr County during the deadly Texas floods. The alerts began late on July 3 and escalated in urgency through the morning of July 4, with the first message to "SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!" sent at 4:03 a.m. However, no alerts were sent by local county officials, who relied solely on the federal warnings. The timeline raises questions about the effectiveness and public reception of the alerts as the disaster unfolded with stunning speed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose steep 25% tariffs on all imports from Japan and South Korea, set to take effect on August 1. The move follows a 90-day pause and reimposes the higher rates initially proposed in April as part of the administration's "reciprocal tariff" strategy to address trade deficits. The announcement, made via letters to the respective country leaders, caused U.S. financial markets to fall, with the Dow Jones dropping over 400 points amid renewed concerns about escalating trade disputes with major economic partners.</p>

          <p>A federal judge sharply criticized and denied the Department of Justice's motions to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The judge called the government's arguments "meritless" and found it "highly problematic" that the DOJ had secretly arranged his return to the U.S. to face indictment without informing her court. Abrego Garcia is now detained in Tennessee on human trafficking charges, and the judge is demanding clarity on the government's intentions regarding his potential future removal.</p>

While short-term CDs presently feature higher interest rates, calculations show that long-term CDs can still generate more total interest over their full term due to the extended period of compounding. For a $20,000 deposit, a five-year CD at 4.20% would earn over $4,500, significantly more than any available short-term option. Savers are advised to consider their ability to lock away funds for an extended period to avoid early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>El Gato Night Market, a vibrant hub for Latino street food in Los Angeles, is struggling to return to normal after temporarily shutting down due to immigration enforcement raids in the area. The market, which typically hosts 70-80 vendors, has seen both vendor and customer numbers drop as the community fears being targeted by ICE. Organizers and vendors, many of whom are immigrants who rely on the market as their primary income, are balancing their own safety concerns with the need to provide a sense of comfort and familiarity for their largely Latino clientele.</p>

          <p>Poland's recent decision to implement temporary border checks with Germany and Lithuania is fueling concerns about the long-term viability of the EU's Schengen Area, which allows for passport-free travel. While officially aimed at curbing irregular migration, the move is seen by many analysts as a tit-for-tat response to Germany's own increased controls and part of a broader European trend toward national self-interest over collective policy. Experts warn that the permanent reinstatement of internal borders could have significant economic costs and erode one of the most tangible symbols of European integration.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques The New York Times for its coverage of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, arguing the paper appears to be on a "crusade" against him. The piece focuses on a news story about Mamdani's college application, which it deems a "made-up scandal" sourced from a problematic intermediary. It also points to a pre-primary editorial that urged voters not to rank Mamdani, suggesting a pattern of opposition that blurs the line between the paper's opinion section and its straight news reporting.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas has raised serious questions about the adequacy of the emergency warning system and whether federal budget cuts played a role. While the National Weather Service issued 22 alerts with escalating urgency, local officials did not initiate their own and some residents reported not receiving or understanding the warnings. Experts have also raised concerns that staffing shortages and suspended programs at the NWS, due to budget cuts, may have hindered coordination with local emergency managers, though the White House has defended the agency's performance.</p>

          <p>In an interview with American host Tucker Carlson, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian alleged that Israel tried to assassinate him during the recent 12-day war. Pezeshkian claimed that Israeli forces bombed a location in Tehran where he was holding a meeting, an attack he said he narrowly escaped. He expressed skepticism about future negotiations with the U.S., questioning how Iran could trust that Israel would not be permitted to attack again. Pezeshkian also reiterated that his country has never sought to develop nuclear weapons.</p>

A contracting notice indicates interest in new fuze development, production of tail-kit components, and general sustainment for the MOP inventory. Advanced fuzing is critical for bunker busters, allowing them to detonate at precise depths to maximize damage against deeply buried targets, and the recent strikes have provided valuable data for future upgrades.</p>

          <p>With a third heatwave expected to bring high temperatures to the UK, farmers are warning that the countryside is like a "tinder box" and that wildfires are a "disaster waiting to happen." Some farmers argue that government-incentivized programs to remove grazing animals, like sheep, from upland areas are leading to a dangerous buildup of dry vegetation that fuels fires. The National Farmers' Union has called for a review of land management policies and urged the public to be vigilant as hotter, drier summers become more frequent.</p>

In contrast, the study also found that the rate of carrying handguns *in school* decreased by 60% during the same period. The findings highlight a need for tailored prevention strategies, as firearms remain the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens.</p>
