        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, located in a Chicago suburb, was shot during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when a Crisis Alternative Response Evanston (C.A.R.E.) team approached a man seemingly suffering from a mental health affliction near a Taco Bell. The man agreed to be checked out by paramedics and was taken to the hospital, where he later became agitated, leading to the struggle and shooting; the security guard sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and the man was taken into police custody after a handgun was recovered. The emergency room was placed on lockdown following the incident, with officials stating that there was no active threat to the safety of patients and team members. The author reflects on the fast-acting response of Evanston Hospital personnel who swiftly aided the security personnel. </p>

          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that the university would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of waging a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary for national security and to combat antisemitism on campus. The BBC contacted the DHS for comment on the latest order.</p>

          <p>The attorney for the ex-wife of Travis Decker, who is accused of murdering his three daughters, claims that the system failed him by not providing adequate mental health resources. Arianna Cozart stated that Decker, a former military member, struggled with PTSD and was unable to receive sufficient help. Despite restrictions on his parenting due to mental health concerns, there were no apparent red flags before the girls' disappearance, and he was an active and loving father. The ex-wife, Whitney Decker, expresses love and empathy for Travis, attributing his actions to a mental breakdown possibly triggered by his military training. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts, but later reversed the decision after online encouragement. This occurred amidst an escalating feud between Musk and Trump, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA reaffirmed its commitment to space objectives despite the conflict.

          <p>The Atlantic analyzes the public feud between Elon Musk and President Trump, describing it as a "Super Bowl of schadenfreude" and the logical endpoint of internet beefs. The article explores the motivations behind the conflict, noting that both men are masters of attention and have historically benefited from public feuds. It also discusses the downstream effects of their conflict, including the creation of content for others and the distraction from important policy issues. The author concludes that this spectacle is evidence of societal tendency toward abstraction, even obfuscation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has doubled down on his claims, without evidence, that Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies Biden didn't support during his presidency. Trump stated that he ordered the Justice Department and White House to investigate Biden's mental state while in office, alleging that the use of the autopen was a "scandal" and disrespectful to the country. Biden has denied these allegations, calling the probe a distraction from Republican legislative efforts. The Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment, but the article reflects on how Attorney General Pam Bondi has not directly addressed Trump's directive.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a lower court's ruling that had ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court's decision reversed a July 2022 district court order that required the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The focal point of the appeal trial was whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate after a TEPCO unit estimated in 2008 that a tsunami of up to 15.7 meters could hit the plant. The acquittals of two former vice presidents in a criminal suit were finalized in March, and charges against the former chairman were dismissed after his death.</p>

          <p>Search efforts have been scaled down for a Los Angeles woman, Jomarie Calasanz, who was swept away by the Kaweah River in Sequoia National Park while trying to save her sister. The multi-agency search, which included search-and-rescue teams and aerial searches, lasted for nine days but was hampered by dangerous river conditions due to snowpack melt. Park officials have urged visitors to stay out of rivers during elevated-flow conditions and warned of slippery rocks near riverbanks. The family has created a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the ongoing search and support.</p>
