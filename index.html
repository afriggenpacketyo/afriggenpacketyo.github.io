          <p>The iconic Honey Deuce cocktail at the U.S. Open, priced at $23, has seen its cost rise faster than the general rate of inflation over the past decade. Since 2015, the price of the popular vodka-based beverage has increased by approximately 53%, while the broader Consumer Price Index has risen by about 36% during the same period. This price hike means that if the drink's cost had matched inflation, it would be around $20.33 today. Despite the high price, the event sold over 550,000 cocktails last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the artistic and romantic relationship between painter Alex Katz and his wife, Ada, who has been the subject of nearly 300 of his portraits over their 50-year marriage. Coming of age during the abstract expressionism movement, Katz developed his own unique style of realism, with Ada serving as his primary muse. Curators note that his interest lies more in capturing style, appearance, and the play of light rather than deep emotional introspection. This enduring collaboration between artist and muse is celebrated in an exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum, showcasing the evolution of his distinctive work.</p>

          <p>The article recounts the intricate murder-for-hire plot orchestrated by millionaire Dino Guglielmelli against his estranged wife, model Monica Olsen, during their acrimonious divorce. Consumed by the thought of losing his assets and custody, Guglielmelli hired his business associate, Rick Fuhrmann, to kill her. However, Fuhrmann secretly worked with law enforcement, recording Guglielmelli confirming his intent to pay $80,000 for the murder, including instructions for it to be brutal. This led to a sting operation and Guglielmelli's arrest, ultimately resulting in a guilty plea and a nine-year prison sentence for attempted murder.</p>

          <p>This commentary reflects on the case of Alix Tichelman, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes on his yacht. The author questions the distribution of blame, suggesting Hayes was an active participant who created the situation by soliciting Tichelman and asking her to inject him with the drug. While acknowledging Tichelman's failure to call for help was a critical mistake, the article posits that Hayes contributed significantly to his own demise. The piece concludes that the case raises complex ethical questions about responsibility and accountability that extend beyond simple legal forensics.</p>

          <p>This investigative article details the death of 51-year-old Google executive Forrest Hayes from a heroin overdose on his yacht, and the subsequent arrest of Alix Tichelman. Security footage from the yacht was crucial, showing Tichelman injecting Hayes with heroin, his subsequent distress, and her failure to call for help as she cleaned the scene and left. Investigators used the dating website SeekingArrangement.com, where the two met, to lure Tichelman into a sting operation, leading to her arrest.

          <p>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the primary U.S. agency protecting workers' rights, has been significantly hobbled under the Trump administration, according to former general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo. The firing of key officials, including the NLRB chair, has left the agency without a quorum, rendering it unable to issue decisions and enforce labor laws effectively. This has empowered corporations like SpaceX to challenge the agency's constitutionality, potentially leading to a flood of similar legal challenges that could paralyze the NLRB for years. Abruzzo warns these actions threaten to roll back worker protections to pre-1935 levels.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the ethical dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. The author draws on historical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, where one member's suffering is felt by all. However, the article argues that this interconnectedness also means we should experience the joys and successes of others, a concept known as 'sympathetic joy' or 'freudenfreude.' It concludes that acknowledging both the world's horrors and its delights is a form of resistance and a way to avoid both cynicism and naive positivity.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), raising concerns among experts about the potential consequences for public health. Critics argue that dismantling or significantly altering the program, which was established to stabilize the vaccine market by handling rare injury claims outside of traditional courts, could lead manufacturers to exit the market. Such a move would reduce vaccine availability and make it harder for individuals with legitimate rare side effects to receive compensation. The article outlines how Kennedy could potentially weaken the program through administrative actions, fueling distrust in vaccines.</p>

          <p>The IRS has provided guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the up to $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit even after its official expiration on September 30. According to the new document, a taxpayer who enters into a "written binding contract" and makes a payment for an EV on or before the deadline is eligible for the credit, even if they take physical possession of the vehicle later. This clarification provides a crucial loophole for buyers facing vehicle delivery delays, allowing them to secure the tax break by ordering and putting down a deposit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former National Guard combat engineer argues that the force's increasing use for domestic law enforcement and to fill civilian roles, such as substitute teachers, distorts its intended mission and erodes public trust. The article contends that deploying the Guard for roles like immigration enforcement or crime suppression blurs the line between military and civilian authority, turning them into occupiers in their own communities.

Furthermore, Kennedy has replaced the CDC's immunization advisory committee with vaccine skeptics and removed recommendations for COVID-19 shots for pregnant women and children.

This move directly reverses the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero commitment and contrasts sharply with the Labour government's policy of banning new exploration licenses.

The directive has targeted rainbow-colored Pride crosswalks, including a memorial at the site of the Pulse nightclub shooting, as well as student-designed safety art at schools. While the state cites a need to keep roads free of political ideologies and claims the art is a safety hazard, research suggests such installations improve driver behavior.

          <p>This opinion piece condemns the Trump administration's decision to honor the Confederacy by returning a controversial memorial to Arlington National Cemetery and reinstating a portrait of Robert E. Lee at West Point. The author, a U.S. Army veteran, argues that such actions trivialize the history of the Civil War and make common cause with apologists for a treasonous rebellion. Drawing a parallel to his own grandfather who fought for Mussolini's army, he asserts that one can mourn ancestors' sacrifices without glorifying their unjust causes. The article concludes that a military cemetery should not feature monuments that praise a rebellion against the United States.</p>

          <p>The deployment of U.S. warships to the Caribbean has heightened anxiety and uncertainty in Venezuela, a nation already grappling with a prolonged crisis of hyperinflation, shortages, and authoritarian rule under Nicolás Maduro. While the Trump administration labels the operation an anti-narcotics effort, it has fueled speculation of a potential U.S. intervention, leaving citizens divided. Some express fear and distress over the increased military tension, while others, weary from years of unresolved political and economic turmoil, cling to the hope that the external pressure might finally bring about change. Many, however, feel powerless and simply try to continue their daily lives.</p>

          <p>The article profiles brothers Jim and Tom Ross, who are successful political consultants for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, yet maintain a deep personal bond that transcends their professional rivalry. Jim, a Democrat, has worked for figures like Gavin Newsom, while Tom, a Republican, has worked for Kevin McCarthy. Despite disagreeing on major issues like California's redistricting, they prioritize their fraternal relationship over politics, offering each other support during personal and professional challenges. Their story stands out as a rare example of maintaining close family ties and mutual respect amidst the intense polarization of contemporary American politics.</p>

          <p>Although the Democratic Party's public approval ratings have hit a 30-year low, with many voters finding its leadership weak, there are emerging signs of optimism for its future. Polls indicate a growing lead for Democrats in the 2026 congressional elections, and potential presidential candidates are actively campaigning against former President Trump, whose own popularity is declining. Strategists suggest the party's path to recovery involves focusing on economic issues like affordability, organizing for midterm victories, and leveraging voter dislike of the opposition. Despite current disarray, a deep bench of new talent and a renewed offensive strategy could signal a turnaround.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism to argue that its roots in America are deeply tied to racism and are not exclusive to one political party. The author contends that the historical struggle of Black Americans against racial oppression provides a model for contemporary resistance, characterized by belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and profound faith. Rather than succumbing to cynicism, the article calls for learning from this legacy of resilience. It highlights how Black resistance has historically pushed the nation closer to its stated ideals, offering hope and a strategy for combating today's autocratic threats.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly accused the club of breaking promises and is demanding they allow him to transfer to Newcastle United before the deadline. In a social media statement, Wissa claimed he had written assurances he could leave for a "reasonable offer," but that Brentford has since inflated his price from £40m to around £65m after rejecting two bids from Newcastle. The DR Congo international, who has not been training with the first team, expressed his frustration and sadness, urging the club's owners to honor their original agreement. The situation is part of a potential chain of transfers involving other Premier League players.</p>

Organizers cited concerns over mass migration eroding national unity, as well as its impact on wages, housing, and infrastructure. The government denounced the events, with ministers stating that such divisive, racist activism has no place in modern Australia, highlighting a recent rise in right-wing extremism in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK experiencing increasingly hot summers, more Britons are turning to air conditioning, sparking a debate over its environmental, financial, and health impacts. While air-con improves comfort and productivity, its use increases electricity consumption and relies on potent greenhouse gases (HFCs) for cooling. Experts advise buying energy-efficient models and ensuring proper disposal to mitigate environmental harm. Medically, while poorly maintained units can spread germs, clean systems can improve air quality. The article explores these trade-offs, including the high cost of climate-friendly heat pumps that can also provide cooling, as the nation adapts to a warmer climate.</p>

The demonstrations, which have occurred in major cities and intensified after the death of a protester, have seen public buildings set on fire and a minister's house ransacked. While condemning the violence and ordering a strong response from security forces, Prabowo also announced a key concession, stating that parliament had agreed to revoke certain controversial financial allowances for lawmakers, which was one of the initial demands of the protesters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political observers and activists are increasingly warning that autocratic governance is becoming normalized in the United States under the Trump administration. The article points to a pattern of actions, including fawning cabinet meetings, the criminalization of political opposition, calls for the arrest of critics, and the use of federal agencies for politically motivated raids. This consolidation of power, which includes efforts to control the bureaucracy, legal system, and media, follows a playbook seen in other authoritarian regimes. Some experts now classify the U.S. as a "competitive authoritarian system," where democratic institutions are used to undermine democracy itself.</p>
