The move follows a period of market volatility and sharp stock declines in the tech sector after the initial tariff announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rescue teams in California are overwhelmed by a surge in sea lion strandings due to a severe outbreak of domoic acid poisoning caused by harmful algae blooms. SeaWorld San Diego's rescue team has rescued significantly more sea lions this year compared to previous years, and they are receiving around 100 calls a day. Warming oceans, potentially exacerbated by debris from recent wildfires, are believed to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of these toxic algae blooms. The rescue teams are working around the clock, but the survival rate for affected sea lions is only around 50% if treated promptly.</p>

            <p>United States midfielder Weston McKennie is among 13 soccer players being investigated for illegal online betting in Italy. The investigation stems from evidence given by Sandro Tonali and Nicolò Fagioli in 2023, who were previously banned for gambling offenses. The players are being investigated for using illegal platforms for online poker and betting on other sports. There is no evidence that the other players ever gambled on soccer matches, but their names emerged from depositions given by Tonali and Fagioli and analysis of their devices.</p>

The National Park Service restored the webpages, stating the changes were made without approval by top leadership.</p>

            <p>Human remains and bone fragments were discovered at a construction site on Temple University's campus. The university stated that the discovery was not unexpected, as the site occupies a portion of the former Monument Cemetery, which was acquired in the 1950s and supposedly relocated to Lawnview Memorial Park. Temple University says they have a protocol in place for when human remains are discovered, which includes notifying the Philadelphia Coroner's office, the Medical Examiner's Office and archeologists and law enforcement.</p>

            <p>A report by the Foundation for Defence of Democracies indicates that weak supply chains are putting U.S. weapons deliveries to Taiwan and Ukraine at risk. While U.S. support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of weapons to Taiwan or Israel, insufficient spending has damaged the U.S. defense industrial base. The report warns that Washington may struggle to sustain weapons supplies to its partners without significant investments and reforms. The Donald Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defense spending for next year.</p>

            <p>Alex Garland, in collaboration with Ray Mendoza, has created a gritty and realistic war film titled 'Warfare' that is based on a real skirmish from the 2006 Battle of Ramadi. The film strips away the typical plotting of military dramas and presents an unembellished depiction of a military operation gone awry. 'Warfare' focuses on the waiting and tension inherent in battle, deviating from the typical action movie structure. The film features a cast of talented young stars but prioritizes realism over Hollywood glitz.</p>

            <p>Official figures indicate a 14.3% decrease in UK residents visiting the US in March compared to the same month in 2024, potentially influenced by Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Analysts suggest that claims of other countries "cheating" Americans and reports of deportations may be contributing to the decline. Travelers from other European countries also appear to be avoiding the US, with visits from Western Europe down 17% in March. Concerns are growing that this trend could impact future events like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

            <p>Ordinary citizens in Ukraine are contributing to the war effort by creating DIY drones for the military. These drones, often equipped with explosives, are used in combat against enemy targets.

Despite the challenges, Ukrainian drone makers are innovating and adapting to the ongoing conflict.</p>
