          <p>Samsung Electronics has secured a major contract valued at $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors to Tesla, a deal confirmed by CEO Elon Musk. The agreement, which extends to the end of 2033, is strategically crucial for Tesla's future artificial intelligence development, with Musk noting Samsung's new Texas facility will produce Tesla's next-generation AI chips. While Samsung's regulatory filing did not initially name the counterparty to protect trade secrets, Musk's confirmation highlights a significant partnership in the competitive chip manufacturing industry. This deal is expected to bolster Samsung's foundry business, which has been competing with industry leader TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After 74 years of scientific expeditions and planning, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in Tibet. The dam is set to be the world's most powerful, with a planned capacity of 60,000 megawatts, three times that of the Three Gorges Dam. The project represents a monumental engineering feat for Beijing, culminating decades of research that began shortly after Tibet's liberation in 1951. This ambitious initiative underscores China's long-term strategic goals for energy and infrastructure development in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a significant win for the Trump administration, though not a complete loss for Brussels. The deal sets a 15% U.S. tariff on many EU goods, lower than the threatened 30% but higher than previous rates, representing a major climbdown for the EU. In exchange, the EU avoids a full-blown trade war and gains some stability, despite facing higher costs for exports like cars. This agreement showcases President Trump's aggressive negotiating style and its effectiveness in rebalancing trade relationships, even with major economic partners.</p>

          <p>In a poignant essay, Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler shared his memories of Ozzy Osbourne's final concert, which took place just weeks before the rock legend's death at 76. Butler described being shocked at how frail his longtime friend had become, noting Osbourne performed while seated on a throne. The tribute show, featuring a host of rock icons, served as a final homage to the "Prince of Darkness." Butler expressed gratitude for their last performance together, calling their 57-year friendship an "incredible ride" and a fitting end to their shared musical story.</p>

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to overwhelmingly reject a 3.6% pay increase, a move that could lead to widespread strikes later in the year. The union has criticized the offer as "grotesque," pointing out that it is lower than increases given to other public sector workers like doctors and teachers. With the consultative vote's turnout expected to surpass the 50% threshold required for industrial action, the RCN is urging government ministers to enter negotiations to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn. The GMB union, representing other health workers, has also rejected the offer.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union, which imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to cause a significant drop in global exports to the U.S. According to The Observatory of Economic Complexity's Tariff Simulator, this could lead to a 46% decrease in forecasted imports by 2027 compared to recent years. The model predicts that countries will rewire trade relationships away from the U.S., with China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases in exports to America.

The party has also capitalized on anxieties surrounding immigration and tourism, blaming foreigners for social and economic burdens.

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, are experiencing a surge in demand for their "citizenship by investment" programs, largely driven by U.S. citizens. These programs allow individuals to gain a passport by purchasing real estate, with minimum investments starting around $200,000. For many wealthy Americans, political volatility and social issues are fueling the desire for a "plan B" passport, which offers visa-free travel to over 150 countries. While these programs are a vital source of revenue for the island economies, they face scrutiny from the EU and U.S. over security and financial crime concerns.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, preventing a transatlantic trade war just before a key deadline. Announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland, the deal establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, half the rate Trump had threatened. As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. energy products and investing heavily in the U.S. The deal brings a measure of stability to the €1.4 trillion trade relationship, though some punitive tariffs, like those on steel, remain in place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Animal welfare charity RSPCA is calling for mandatory licensing of all dog rescue organizations in the U.K. due to growing concerns about imported pets. An investigation found that thousands of dogs are being brought from countries like Romania and Ukraine with minimal vetting, leading to issues with infectious diseases, such as Brucella canis, and severe behavioral problems. Owners have reported receiving aggressive or traumatized animals delivered directly to their homes, a practice one expert likened to a "Deliveroo for dogs." The trend is also placing a strain on UK-based shelters, which are often left to deal with the consequences.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of the Gaza Strip to allow humanitarian aid to be distributed. This measure is intended to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address the severe hunger crisis in the territory. The pause affects populated areas like Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi. While the UN has welcomed the move as a way to reach starving people, it reiterated that a full ceasefire is the only way to ensure aid consistently and safely reaches the entire civilian population in need.</p>

          <p>Google has admitted that its Android Earthquake Alerts system significantly failed during the catastrophic 2023 earthquake in Turkey, which killed over 55,000 people. The system underestimated the quake's magnitude, sending only 469 high-level "Take Action" alerts when up to 10 million people were in the danger zone and could have received a warning. Most users received a lower-level "Be Aware" notification not designed to wake people up. Google has since updated its algorithms, but the failure raises serious questions about the reliability of such technology in life-threatening situations and the transparency of tech companies.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the brilliant and influential musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and '60s, has died at the age of 97. A Harvard-educated mathematician, Lehrer led a dual life, famously writing and performing songs that cleverly skewered politics, the nuclear age, and societal norms. After achieving widespread fame, he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on his academic career teaching mathematics. His unique genre of comedy songwriting, marked by its intelligence and subversive humor, inspired generations of entertainers, including "Weird Al" Yankovic.</p>

          <p>Archaeological discoveries at the Keeladi site in Tamil Nadu, India, are challenging established narratives about early Indian civilization and sparking a political battle. Artifacts dating back to 580 BCE suggest the existence of a literate, urban society in Southern India that was contemporaneous with civilizations in the north. This finding has become a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling a deep-rooted cultural and political north-south divide. While archaeologists debate the evidence, politicians have seized on the findings to assert the antiquity and independence of Tamil culture, creating controversy around the federally-controlled excavation reports.</p>

          <p>Under the new government of President Javier Milei, human rights organizations in Argentina are facing mass layoffs and funding cuts, threatening decades of work to address the crimes of the country's military dictatorship. Key institutions located at the former ESMA detention center, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, have seen their staff decimated, including the National Archive of Remembrance and agencies that identify stolen children. This has sparked protests from activists, survivors, and groups like the Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who fear these austerity measures are a deliberate attempt to undermine memory and justice.</p>

          <p>An investigation by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully tracked down and identified a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights." By meticulously analyzing the plane's flight logs, they were able to prove its use in the 1977 disappearance of a group of activists and French nuns, providing crucial evidence for their murder. This evidence was instrumental in the 2017 conviction of the pilots and other officials for crimes against humanity. The plane has since been returned to Argentina, where it stands as a chilling witness at the ESMA memorial museum.</p>
