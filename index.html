        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a series of in-depth interviews, candidates vying to become California's next governor in 2026 have articulated their stances on pressing issues. Topics discussed include congressional redistricting, immigration, homelessness, and the state's high cost of living. The field, comprising both Democrats and Republicans, offered varied perspectives, with most Democrats supporting a Newsom-backed redistricting measure while Republicans criticized it. This series aims to provide voters with direct answers beyond typical campaign talking points, covering a comprehensive range of topics from crime to the state's insurance crisis.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has caused the American embassy in China to halt regular updates on its social media accounts, a move that has sparked widespread discussion and criticism among Chinese netizens. The embassy posted notices on platforms like Weibo, stating that non-essential updates would cease until full government operations resume, though urgent security information will still be shared. This suspension of digital diplomacy prompted thousands of comments, many of them ironically reflecting on the American political system's instability. Passport and visa services are expected to continue as the situation permits.</p>

          <p>Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed to the Chicago area to protect federal agents and facilities, including those for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This federal mobilization has been met with a lawsuit from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who argue there is no crisis justifying the troops' presence. A federal judge is set to hear arguments for a temporary restraining order to block the deployment. The move is considered highly unusual, as it involves federalizing one state's Guard to operate in another, raising questions about state sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Dolly Parton has taken to social media to dispel rumors about her declining health, which had caused a frenzy among her fans. Concerns grew after her sister posted a message asking for prayers and Parton postponed a series of shows last month for unspecified health reasons. In a video, the 79-year-old singer appeared in good spirits on a set, declaring she was still working hard and not ready to die. She acknowledged that she had neglected her health following the death of her husband, Carl Dean, but is now receiving treatment and feeling better.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula, though it continues to generate high surf and dangerous rip currents. The storm is not expected to make landfall but its moisture is projected to bring significant rainfall and potential flash flooding to parts of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico later in the week.

          <p>The general manager of the Condor Club, a historic topless bar in San Francisco, was shot and killed outside his Santa Rosa home. Mark Calcagni, 60, was found with multiple gunshot wounds, and police are currently investigating the homicide with no known motive or suspect. The Condor Club, famous as America's oldest topless bar and the site of an infamous death-by-piano incident in 1983, expressed shock and sorrow at the loss. The club was recently designated as a legacy business by the city of San Francisco, a status Calcagni helped secure.</p>

          <p>A woman in her 60s died on Monday after experiencing a medical emergency while on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. The guest was found unresponsive in her "doom buggy" seat after the ride concluded and was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. Anaheim police and Disneyland officials stated that the incident appears to be an unfortunate medical episode, and there was no indication of any operational issue with the attraction, which reopened shortly after. Theme park safety experts note that such deaths are extremely rare, particularly on slow-moving rides like the Haunted Mansion.</p>

          <p>The 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration details a multi-stage process to end the Israel-Hamas war, beginning with an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian prisoners and withdraw its forces to a designated perimeter. The plan also proposes that a temporary "technocratic" committee, supported by an international stabilization force, would assume governance of Gaza, replacing Hamas. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has backed the proposal, it sidesteps a definitive path to Palestinian statehood, framing it only as a potential future aspiration.</p>

          <p>A decade ago, Middle School 50 in Brooklyn was listed as persistently dangerous with declining enrollment, but principal Benjamin Honoroff has engineered a dramatic turnaround. By integrating debate techniques into every subject, from English to math, he fostered critical thinking and communication skills among students. The school's debate team flourished, eventually winning a national championship. This innovative approach led to a significant rise in test scores, with proficiency jumping from single digits to over 60% in English and 70% in math, and enrollment has since increased substantially.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has restricted access to several major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, according to the global internet monitor NetBlocks. This move follows a ban on TikTok implemented in 2022 and a near-total internet shutdown that occurred for 48 hours in late September. Residents in major cities reported being unable to access the sites without using a VPN to bypass the restrictions. While platforms like WhatsApp and X appear to still be functional, the increasing censorship raises concerns among rights groups about the erosion of communication and information access for Afghan citizens.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, to address protests have created a sense of anxiety and negatively impacted the city's image, according to local business owners. While protests have been largely contained, the president's rhetoric describing the city as a "war zone" has hurt local commerce, which is still recovering from the pandemic. A federal judge initially blocked the deployment following a lawsuit from the state, although an appeals court has since allowed the troops to remain under federal control while prohibiting their deployment into the city for now.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning to buy holiday decorations this year may face limited availability and higher prices for items like artificial Christmas trees, lights, and wreaths. A major U.S. importer has warned that tariffs from the ongoing trade war have forced them to bring in 25% less product and raise prices by about 10%. The company advises consumers to shop early rather than waiting for Black Friday, as supplies are expected to be short. The issue reflects broader concerns about weaker consumer demand and the economic impact of trade policies on both businesses and shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard a case brought by an Illinois congressman who is challenging a state regulation that allows mail-in ballots to be counted for up to 14 days after an election. Justices from both the conservative and liberal wings appeared skeptical of the lawsuit, as the congressman, Rep. Michael Bost, won the election in question. The court questioned whether he had suffered any real harm that would give him the legal standing to sue. The case tests the boundaries of who can challenge election laws, with justices probing whether any candidate, regardless of their chance of winning, should be allowed to sue.</p>

          <p>A former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, who was fired amid a heated dispute over books with LGBTQ+ and sexual content, has won a $700,000 settlement. Terri Lesley was terminated in 2023 after community members demanded the removal of certain books from the youth sections, a move she resisted. In her lawsuit, Lesley claimed that county officials violated her First Amendment rights by siding with the book objectors and firing her. While the county denied her claims, they agreed to the settlement, which Lesley said vindicates her decision to stand up for constitutional principles.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump will visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday for a "routine yearly checkup." This will be his second physical examination since April, when his physician declared him "fully fit to execute the duties" of the presidency. The president's health has been a subject of public speculation, particularly after he was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency over the summer. Following the checkup, Trump is reportedly considering a trip to the Middle East to help finalize the recently announced Gaza peace agreement.</p>
