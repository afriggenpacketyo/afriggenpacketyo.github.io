          <p>The United States has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and blocked new arrivals, citing South Sudan's failure to accept its nationals who have been deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the transitional government in Juba is 'taking advantage of the United States,' emphasizing that countries must accept the return of their citizens. This decision comes amid growing concerns about political instability in South Sudan and tensions between the Trump administration and international governments over deportation policies. The action affects a relatively small number of South Sudanese individuals in the US, including those previously granted Temporary Protected Status.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consultation for England's men's health strategy is launching this month, addressing the fact that men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this disparity include higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, and elevated cholesterol and blood pressure. Biological reasons, such as a less effective male immune system, and societal expectations that men should be strong and resilient also play a role. Additionally, men are less likely to seek healthcare services or discuss their health concerns, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and accessible healthcare options.</p>

          <p>A mother's death from cervical cancer has led to an apology and undisclosed damages awarded to her family after the NHS admitted to misreporting her screening results. Louise Gleadell had two cervical screening tests, in 2008 and 2012, that were incorrectly reported as negative, when in fact, the samples were deemed 'inadequate' in a 2017 internal review. This meant that she missed the opportunity to treat precancerous cells, and her family says her death was preventable. The trust has since strengthened its processes for sharing findings of cervical screening quality audits.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on imported goods marks a shift away from globalization and free trade, potentially disrupting the US economy. These tariffs, aimed at reducing the trade deficit, contradict conventional economic theories and could lead to higher inflation and a recession. While the administration aims to bring back manufacturing jobs, the move risks alienating global consumers and disrupting supply chains.

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has unveiled a new approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University, the technique combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The GRM models have demonstrated competitive performance compared to existing methods. This announcement comes amid speculation about the release of DeepSeek-R2, the successor to the company's R1 reasoning model.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23. The IDF initially claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached suspiciously in darkness without headlights or flashing lights, however footage has shown that the ambulances had lights on. Israel now admits this earlier account was inaccurate, and attributes the report to the troops involved, and has admitted that the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members. The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas but has provided no evidence and admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire.</p>
