          <p>Following a major energy agreement between the European Union and the United States, stocks for liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant rise. The deal, which involves the EU purchasing $750 billion in US energy, is intended to decrease Europe's reliance on Russian gas and oil. Companies involved in LNG exportation and infrastructure, such as Cheniere and New Fortress Energy, saw their share prices climb. This energy pact is a key component of a larger trade deal that also includes new tariffs and substantial EU investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines has announced it will furlough 270 pilots this fall and downgrade an additional 140 captains to first officers as it contends with financial difficulties. The move is part of the airline's strategy to align its staffing levels with a reduced flight schedule for the off-peak season. Having recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Spirit is taking these steps to improve operational efficiency and work towards profitability. The airline industry has been facing softer demand, particularly during non-peak travel times, contributing to Spirit's need for these adjustments.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase claims that fintech middlemen, such as Plaid, are overwhelming its computer systems with an excessive number of data requests, or API calls. According to an internal memo, the bank found that only a small fraction of these requests are directly initiated by customers for transactions, with the majority being for other purposes. As a result, JPMorgan is preparing to introduce new fees for this data access, a move that could significantly disrupt the fintech industry, which has long benefited from free access. Plaid has disputed the bank's characterization, stating the data pulls are standard industry practice for providing essential customer services.</p>

          <p>A well-known retirement income strategy, the "4% rule," suggests that retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings for at least 30 years. This article explores how the rule applies when annuities are part of a retirement plan. It serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what could be drawn from a traditional portfolio. While an annuity might offer a higher payout rate and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of the standard 4% rule.

Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" plan aims to address these problems, but investors are cautious as the required changes are complex and costly. The company's large scale, with roughly 40,000 stores worldwide, makes implementing changes a slower process compared to his previous success.</p>

          <p>President Trump's effort to keep his former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey has sparked a legal challenge. An attorney for a defendant in a federal case has filed a motion arguing that Habba's appointment is unlawful and violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This move follows a complex series of events where federal judges in New Jersey attempted to replace Habba, only to have their chosen successor fired by the Attorney General. The challenge contends the executive branch overstepped its authority, creating questionable legal standing for prosecutions under Habba.</p>

          <p>Recession fears on Wall Street have diminished as the final effective tariff rates from the Trump administration's trade policies appear to be settling in a 15-20% range, lower than the more aggressive levels initially threatened. Economists had worried that higher tariffs would trigger a significant economic slowdown. However, the recent trade deal with the European Union and a strong global growth backdrop have led to increased optimism. While tariffs are still seen as a drag on growth, the risk of a severe recession is now considered to be easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is requesting a federal court to order an expedited deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch in his lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. The lawsuit stems from an article about an allegedly fake letter celebrating sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's birthday, which the paper claimed Trump had written. Trump's lawyers are citing Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and recent health issues as reasons for the urgency, arguing he may be unavailable for testimony at a later trial.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. The ruling, from U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston, states that patients would likely suffer adverse health consequences if the funding were to be cut. The lawsuit was filed by Planned Parenthood in response to a provision in a recent tax bill aimed at defunding the organization. This court order ensures continued access to Medicaid-funded services like birth control and cancer screenings while the litigation proceeds.</p>

The two-year POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants in the intensive lifestyle program not only boosted their mental abilities but also appeared to slow the cognitive declines typically associated with aging, scoring similarly to people one to two years younger.

While the Trump administration argues the tariffs will boost domestic manufacturing, the levies on imported goods and materials from major trading partners are putting pressure on companies, who may pass the additional costs on to consumers.
