          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The court acknowledged the plaintiff's case has merit but found insufficient evidence to block the policy while the lawsuit continues. This decision has alarmed advocacy groups, who warn that families will be separated and individuals will be at risk of deportation to unsafe home countries. The administration argues that conditions in both nations have improved enough for TPS recipients to return safely.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to Minot, North Dakota. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar, had not warned him of the bomber's presence. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which involved a flight with 76 passengers and four crew members, all of whom landed safely.</p>

          <p>Following the recent death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Bill Cosby shared his memories of his former on-screen son in an interview. Cosby described Warner, who drowned in Costa Rica at age 54, as a consummate professional and a great student of his craft. He noted that the two maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after "The Cosby Show" ended, with Warner calling him regularly. Warner's role as Theo Huxtable was a breakout performance, but his career also included numerous other television roles and a Grammy-winning music career.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from cutting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The defunding was part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which aimed to strip federal funds from the organization. The judge, an Obama appointee, stated the bill unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood affiliates that do not perform abortions and that the injunction poses minimal harm to the government. The Department of Justice had argued the measure was intended to stop federal subsidies for abortion providers, and it is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that President Trump's widespread tariffs, while widely criticized, have an unexpected positive consequence. They are compelling nations like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers and protectionist policies. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is forcing these governments to look inward and pursue domestic reforms to enhance their own economic efficiency and competitiveness. While progress is being seen in Canada and China, the EU's focus appears to be shifting toward defense spending rather than trade liberalization. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend could force timekeepers to consider an unprecedented "negative leap second"—removing a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with the planet's rotation. While leap seconds have been added in the past to account for a slower spin, one has never been subtracted, raising concerns about potential disruptions to computer systems and telecommunications. Factors influencing the speed include the moon's gravity and atmospheric changes, while melting polar ice from climate change is paradoxically having a slight slowing effect.</p>

During his first term, Trump successfully appointed numerous conservative judges, often with guidance from the Federalist Society. Bove's nomination represents a continuation of this strategy to install judges with an originalist interpretation of the Constitution. The profile examines Bove's background and legal philosophy, positioning him as a key figure in the ongoing effort to create a new "MAGA judiciary" and solidify a conservative legal legacy.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores how the Trump administration is using the court system to enact its policy goals, potentially reshaping the balance of power in the U.S. government. Recent Supreme Court rulings have expanded presidential immunity and limited the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, emboldening the administration. Concurrently, the president and his staff have engaged in unprecedented verbal attacks on judges, questioning their legitimacy and fueling hostility. This has created a constitutional tension, as judges grapple with how to assert their authority against an executive branch actively challenging it.</p>

          <p>The 13-year-old step-grandson of reality TV star Duane "Dog the Bounty Hunter" Chapman has died in what is being described as a tragic accident. The teenager, Anthony, was allegedly shot by his own father, Gregory Zecca, who is Chapman's stepson from his current marriage to Francie Chapman. The incident occurred in Naples, Florida, and is currently under investigation by the local sheriff's office, which has described it as an isolated event. In a statement, the Chapman family confirmed the death, calling it an "incomprehensible tragic accident" and asking for privacy while they grieve.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate what it calls "illegal DEI practices" at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The complaint alleges the university systematically uses race and identity-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, in violation of civil rights laws. The group specifically targets pathway programs and financial aid for students from lower-income families as proxies for race-based admissions. This action is part of a broader conservative legal effort targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in higher education.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, the only officer convicted in connection with the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison. A jury found him guilty of violating Taylor's civil rights by using excessive force when he fired ten shots into her apartment. The sentence was notably harsher than the one-day term recommended by the Trump-led Department of Justice, a position the judge called "inappropriate." The case highlights a shift in the DOJ's approach since the change in administration, which has moved to roll back police oversight agreements initiated under President Biden.</p>

          <p>A 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced amid heightened scrutiny of Donald Trump's past associations, particularly with Jeffrey Epstein. In the clip, Stern asked Trump if he had a sexual "age limit," to which Trump responded he did not want to be like a congressman involved with "12-year-olds." The comment was a reference to a contemporary scandal involving Rep. Mark Foley, who was accused of sending suggestive messages to 16-year-old congressional pages. The resurfaced interview adds to the questions surrounding Trump's past statements and conduct as he faces criticism over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.</p>

          <p>The head of Sport England has formally expressed deep concern to the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, about the racist and sexist online abuse directed at England's women's football team, the Lionesses. In a letter, the agency warned that this "toxic culture" threatens to undermine efforts to boost female participation in sports. The letter calls for stronger enforcement of the Online Safety Act to tackle misogyny and racism, noting that social media companies have given trolls "free rein" for too long. The action comes after Lionesses defender Jess Carter revealed she had been a target of online racist abuse.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana, as well as expand capacity at Guantanamo Bay, to detain immigrants. According to correspondence obtained by NPR, the Defense Department approved the request, which allows for the detention of up to 1,000 people at each of the U.S. bases. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader push to increase immigrant arrests and detentions amid a shortage of bed space in existing facilities. Democratic lawmakers condemned the decision as an inappropriate use of military resources that could jeopardize military preparedness.</p>

          <p>A significant gap is emerging between China's positive official economic figures and the financial struggles faced by its citizens. While the government reports robust growth, many individuals, like a Chengdu accountant who hasn't had a raise in five years, are experiencing wage stagnation and job insecurity. Experts note that this disconnect highlights a "different world" from the rosy data, as households and businesses grapple with a weak job market and an uncertain future. This on-the-ground reality poses a significant challenge for Beijing as it aims to sustain economic momentum through the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, founder of a Spanish-language news outlet, says he has been "emotionally destroyed" by his month-long detention in an ICE facility in Georgia. Guevara, who was arrested while live-streaming a protest, believes his detention is direct retaliation for his work covering ICE raids in the Atlanta area. While DHS claims he was arrested for obstruction and is in the country illegally, his lawyer notes he has a work permit and a path to citizenship. Guevara, a self-described former conservative, says the experience has made him reconsider his political views and regret prioritizing work over his family.</p>
