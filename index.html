          <p>President Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests, citing violent clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. The White House stated that the troops were necessary to address attacks on ICE officers and federal law enforcement agents. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as "purposefully inflammatory" and requested the troops be returned to his command, asserting that local authorities could handle the situation. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described the deployment as a "chaotic escalation," urging protesters to remain peaceful amidst rising tensions and community fear.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed its plan to divide into two separate public entities by the following year, a move driven by the evolving media landscape and the shift from cable to streaming services.

David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will become CEO of the global networks business.

          <p>Former Reform UK chairman Zia Yusuf dismissed a controversy surrounding an MP's call for a burka ban as a minor issue, despite initially criticizing the MP's remarks on social media. Yusuf, who is Muslim, regretted his post and attributed it to exhaustion, later returning to work for the party in a different role focused on cutting wasteful spending. The controversy began when newly-elected MP Sarah Pochin questioned the Prime Minister about banning the burka, leading to Yusuf's criticism and subsequent resignation as chairman. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage acknowledged the party had experienced a "speed bump" due to the incident, emphasizing Yusuf's quick regret over his comments.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expressed concern over the escalation and urged peaceful protest.

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is advocating for a unified capital markets regulator within the European Union to enhance market efficiency. In a letter to the European Commission, NBIM emphasized that better and simpler regulation is essential for EU market reforms, which are currently lagging behind in dynamism and investment opportunities. The fund manages a substantial portfolio of EU securities and highlighted the need to address regional fragmentation in securities law, corporate law, insolvency, and tax regimes.

          <p>China has expressed its support for an investigation into heavy metal pollution in the Mekong River, following reports linking it to mining operations in Myanmar. The Chinese embassy in Thailand acknowledged the Thai government's concerns and emphasized that Chinese companies operating overseas are required to comply with local laws and regulations. The embassy also stated China's willingness to collaborate with Mekong basin countries to protect the river's ecology and water quality. This commitment comes after Thailand's Pollution Control Department reported unsafe levels of heavy metals in rivers in the north of the country.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is hoping to put a controversial decision regarding winter fuel payments behind them after a series of adjustments to the policy. The initial plan to limit the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit sparked criticism, leading to a slow-motion U-turn by the government. The new threshold for eligibility has been announced, but questions remain about how the government will fund the Â£1.25 billion cost. The handling of this issue has been described as the single biggest misstep of the party's first year in office.</p>

A new analysis reveals that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants contribute substantially to global pollution, ranking the U.S. power sector as the sixth-largest emitter worldwide. Critics argue that removing protections will have dangerous and costly consequences, while experts question the legal basis for deeming pollution "significant" to be regulated.
