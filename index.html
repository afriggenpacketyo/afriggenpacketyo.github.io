The pair navigated through seven checkpoints across China, Nepal, and India, relying on a limited budget and resourcefulness to secure transportation, food, and accommodation. The winning team will share a cash prize of £20,000, which they earned by keeping their victory a secret from friends and family until the broadcast of the final episode. Both Caroline and Tom expressed that the experience has strengthened their bond and instilled new confidence in Caroline, and they now plan to backpack through Kazakhstan.</p>

Day noted that Scheffler's ability to consistently finish in the top five when he doesn't win is a rare feat. Scheffler's recent achievements include eight wins last year, including the Masters and Olympics, and three wins this year, solidifying his position as the World No. 1.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite successfully deterring unauthorized immigration, the Trump administration is facing economic and social challenges due to the resulting labor shortages and increased enforcement tactics. The decline in border crossings has made it difficult for the administration to exceed previous deportation numbers, leading to more aggressive enforcement against long-term US residents. This shift has resulted in economic harm, including slower growth and exacerbated labor shortages, particularly in sectors like construction and agriculture. While immigration restriction was expected to promote social peace, the administration's tactics have instead fueled unrest and clashes between civilians and agents of the state.</p>

          <p>Struggling budget retail chain Poundland has been sold for £1 to US investment firm Gordon Brothers, leading to a potential shake-up involving the closure of up to 100 stores. Pepco, the previous owner, decided to sell the brand after sales declined, struggling to compete with other discount stores. The proposed restructure will be presented to the High Court in England, while Gordon Brothers, previously owning Laura Ashley, plans to continue operating the business under the Poundland brand in the UK and Dealz in the Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland. Retail analysts suggest Poundland's appeal has waned due to consumers seeking better quality and value elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharp contraction of 0.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics, primarily due to the impact of global trade tariffs and domestic tax increases. The decline followed a period of growth in the preceding months, with industrial production and services output particularly affected by President Trump's newly imposed tariffs. The UK was subjected to a 10% "reciprocal tariff" by the US, despite having a balanced trading relationship, while EU exports faced a higher 20% levy. Britain has since secured a trade deal with the US, becoming the first country to do so.</p>

          <p>The House is set to vote on the White House's rescission package, aiming to reclaim $9.4 billion in previously approved funding for foreign aid, NPR, and PBS. The package seeks to permanently enact spending cuts, primarily targeting foreign aid programs, while also effectively defunding NPR and PBS. House Speaker Mike Johnson touts the move as a way to cancel "wasteful spending" and ensure greater government accountability. However, some Republicans have voiced concerns about cuts to programs like PEPFAR, which combats HIV and AIDS globally.</p>

The real beneficiary of these changes would be the private student loan industry, which has a history of deceptive practices and lacks consumer protections.</p>

          <p>The world mourns the death of music icon Brian Wilson, who passed away Wednesday at 82, and during the start of the 90's he recorded a rap song called “Smart Girls”. Wilson's “Smart Girls” was supposed to be the centerpiece and/or big closing number of his Sire Records album “Sweet Insanity,”. Wilson's willingness to experiment with different musical styles is noted, and it's highlighted that he enlisted Matt Dike, a hip-hop producer, to help instead of thinking he could just make a rap song by himself. While other songs from the still-unreleased “Sweet Insanity” would be rerecorded and eventually released on subsequent Wilson projects, namely 2004’s “Gettin In Over My Head,” “Smart Girls” never saw an official release.</p>

The attorney leading the case, Lee Gum-gyu, aims to symbolically rebuke Yoon, gathering the same number of plaintiffs as pro-Yoon legislators who boycotted his impeachment. While the success rate of such claims is low, Lee argues that the martial law declaration, with its threat to civil liberties, makes this case distinct.</p>
