          <p>A California woman, Linda Duffey Gwozdz, was convicted of second-degree murder for the 2007 shooting death of her husband, Patrick Duffey. Her defense claimed the shooting was a tragic accident stemming from a playful exchange where they mimicked the cartoon character Elmer Fudd, leading her to believe the gun was unloaded. Prosecutors argued it was a deliberate execution, pointing to two gunshot wounds and forensic evidence that contradicted her story of "fan-firing" the weapon. After an initial mistrial, a second jury found her guilty, leading to a sentence of 40 years to life.</p>

Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, allegedly hired two hitmen who went to the wrong address and killed the promising student in front of his parents. Aamir's sister, Nishat Siddiqi, urged Ege to surrender, stating that he is not truly free while living a life on the run. The two men who carried out the attack are serving life sentences.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Wipha has forced the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people across southern China as it makes its way toward Guangdong province. China's meteorological authority issued an orange alert, the second-highest warning level, anticipating wind speeds exceeding 150km/h (93mph). The powerful storm has already brought strong winds and torrential rain to the region, including Fujian, Hainan, and Hong Kong. Authorities have evacuated over 12,000 people from the sea and relocated more than 266,000 residents on land in preparation for potential extreme downpours and flooding.</p>

          <p>Technology played a pivotal role in the investigation of Nicole Vander Heyden's 2016 murder in Wisconsin, initially clearing her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, who was the primary suspect. Data from Detrie's Fitbit device corroborated his alibi that he was home during the time of the murder, showing minimal activity. Subsequently, investigators used DNA evidence and location data from the actual killer's phone, tracked via Google Dashboard, to identify and charge George Steven Burch with the crime. The case highlights the growing importance of personal electronic devices in modern criminal justice, both for exoneration and conviction.</p>

Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his iconic pitching motion and is intended to symbolize unity within the Latino community. Valenzuela, who passed away nine months prior, sparked "Fernandomania" in the 1980s and became a cultural icon, particularly for Latino fans who saw him as a source of pride and representation. Fans at the unveiling expressed emotional connections to the player, whose story of rising from a small town in Mexico resonated deeply.</p>

Starter Emmet Sheehan had a difficult outing, and the bullpen was unable to contain the Brewers' offense.

The conflict also drew international attention, with Israel conducting strikes against government forces in Damascus and the U.S. calling for an end to the atrocities.

          <p>This article posits that the unprecedented number of global conflicts, from Gaza to Ukraine, is exacerbated by a collapse of a shared "permanent moral order." The author argues that the rampant and often deliberate targeting of civilians continues because a universal consensus on what is morally indefensible is lacking in a fractured world. This moral relativism, personified by figures like Donald Trump, makes peaceful resolutions nearly impossible as objective standards are replaced by coercion and political identity. The piece suggests that this retreat into subjective morality by governments and the public alike is a key reason why peace remains so elusive.</p>

A combination of population growth, climate change, and over-extraction has severely depleted the city's groundwater, its primary water source. Many residents are forced to buy expensive water from tankers or spend hours fetching it, while up to 80% of the remaining groundwater is contaminated, leading to health crises. The situation is exacerbated by political turmoil and a freeze in foreign aid, leaving millions of residents with a dire and uncertain future.</p>

          <p>More than three years after 13-year-old Iran Moreno was killed by a stray bullet while playing video games in his Pasadena home, prosecutors have filed murder charges against two suspects. Muhammad Abdul-Malik, 38, is accused of being the shooter, and Teraeja Laquanna Flemmings, 31, is accused of being the getaway driver. A break in the cold case came after recently enhanced surveillance video provided new leads, resulting in the suspects' arrests. Authorities stated they do not believe the young boy was the intended target of the November 2021 shooting.</p>
