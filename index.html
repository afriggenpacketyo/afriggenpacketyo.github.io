          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her paedophile father has voiced their disappointment with the government's amendment to the Victims and Courts Bill. The amendment removes parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. The family had to spend over Â£30,000 in legal fees to achieve this protection. Harriet Harman had introduced an amendment to automatically remove parental responsibility after a conviction for serious child sex offences, but the current legislation falls short of this broader protection.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, a renowned Russian ballet choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet for over three decades, has died at the age of 98. Grigorovich's productions, including "Ivan the Terrible" and "Romeo and Juliet," significantly influenced Soviet ballet, and he was celebrated for revitalizing male dance roles. His career at the Bolshoi ended in 1995 amidst disputes over contracts, which led to the first-ever dancers' strike at the theatre. His most famous work is considered to be The Stone Flower, which accompanied a series of folk tales composed by Sergei Prokofiev.</p>

          <p>The parole hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, has been rescheduled for August 21 and 22. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office converted the brothers' clemency hearing into a parole hearing after withdrawing his request for a clemency investigation. The parole board will make a recommendation on whether the brothers should be released early, but Newsom retains the authority to approve or deny the decision. The brothers were resentenced to 50 years-to-life, making them eligible for parole after arguing they acted in self-defense due to years of abuse.</p>

His attorneys argued for clemency, citing his fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and childhood lead exposure, which they claim resulted in severe brain damage and impaired decision-making. Governor Mike Braun rejected Ritchie's clemency bid, and the execution proceeded despite legal challenges regarding the information the jury received about Ritchie's brain damage.</p>

          <p>US Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, has been charged with assaulting federal agents after a clash outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey. The charges follow a visit by McIver and other Democratic members of the New Jersey congressional delegation to the detention center on May 9. At the same time, the US attorney's office dismissed a misdemeanor trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, whose arrest instigated the clash with federal agents. Democrats and legal advocates have reacted with alarm, casting the prosecution of the congresswoman as an attempt to deter legislative oversight and stifle opposition to the Trump administrationâ€™s immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires continue to burn north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, with crews also battling large fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. The Minnesota fires cover approximately 30,000 acres, with the Munger Shaw fire nearly 100% contained and the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires managed jointly as the "Brimson Complex." The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, while the Jenkins Creek Fire tripled in size in the first 24 hours.

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as Air Force One while the new planes are being built. This plan involves secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. The arrangement has drawn criticism due to ethical concerns and questions about the costs of refitting the plane for presidential use. The plan is for Qatar to donate the plane, despite it initially being considered a sale.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent election has not produced a clear majority, resulting in another minority government led by the center-right Democratic Alliance. The rise of the hard-right populist party Chega adds further uncertainty to the political landscape. Corruption scandals and concerns about immigration have fueled the rise of Chega. The Democratic Alliance captured at least 89 seats in the 230-seat National Assembly, while Chega collected the same number of seats as the center-left Socialists â€” 58. The outcome reflects ongoing political instability and challenges in forming a stable government.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Andrea Kendall-Taylor argues that the war in Ukraine is not solely a European concern, but one that directly affects American interests. The Trump administration's desire for a quick resolution and potential withdrawal of support could embolden Russia and other adversaries. Putin's objectives extend beyond Ukraine, seeking to undermine the post-Cold War order and diminish American influence. The author contends that resisting Russia now is more cost-effective than waiting for a potentially larger conflict later, as Moscow is already preparing the ground for a future conflict in Europe.</p>
