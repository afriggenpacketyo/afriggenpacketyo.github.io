          <p>President Trump's repeated suggestions of seeking a third term challenge the 22nd Amendment's two-term limit.  Legal experts largely dismiss the possibility of circumventing this established constitutional provision.  However, hypothetical scenarios involving the vice presidency and unusual succession are discussed, though deemed highly unlikely by most scholars. The potential legal battles and political ramifications of such an attempt are significant.</p>
