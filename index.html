          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators is calling on the U.S. administration to suspend all funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private aid organization backed by Israel. In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns over the GHF's operations, which have been linked to hundreds of civilian deaths, and urged a return to supporting UN-led aid distribution. The letter highlights a controversial $30 million U.S. pledge to the GHF and questions whether oversight was bypassed, as the humanitarian crisis and starvation in Gaza continue to worsen. This political pressure mounts amid international condemnation of the aid system's safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Preparations are reportedly underway to refit a Boeing 747-8 jet donated by the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One. The aircraft, valued at $400 million, was confirmed as a "gift" by President Trump and is slated to be donated to his presidential library after his term. This arrangement has drawn scrutiny, as Article I of the Constitution prohibits a president from accepting gifts from foreign states without congressional consent. Before the plane can be used, it must undergo extensive security checks and renovations that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

          <h2>US Commerce Secretary States EU Must Offer 'Good Enough' Deal to Avoid Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 11:08:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that President Trump is open to a trade deal with the European Union but requires a compelling offer to avert steep tariffs. Lutnick stated the key question is whether the EU can present a deal sufficient for Trump to abandon his plan for 30% tariffs, which are set to take effect after an August 1 deadline. With Trump estimating a 50-50 chance of success and citing around 20 unresolved issues, significant uncertainty remains ahead of his talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU has weighed countermeasures, raising the stakes for the negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Views Israel's New Aid Measures as Gesture to Allies Amid Starvation Crisis</h2>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that Israel's recent humanitarian measures in Gaza, such as aid airdrops and a "tactical pause," are likely a gesture to appease horrified international allies rather than a genuine solution to the starvation crisis. The article argues that these steps do not address the core problem of restricted aid access and criticizes the controversial US-Israeli backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) system, which the UN and other agencies deem inhumane and militarized. It emphasizes that airdrops are an inefficient last resort and that only a ceasefire and unrestricted land access can prevent further catastrophe and death.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump sent a personal letter of condolence to the mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern who was shot and killed in Washington, D.C. In the letter, Trump expressed his heartbreak over the "senseless act of violence" and promised that his administration would continue fighting to ensure law and order. Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, was not the intended target of the June 30 shooting, which also wounded two others. The murder remains unsolved, and the FBI has joined the manhunt for the suspects involved in the crime.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Beijing and Washington are expected to agree to another 90-day extension of their tariff truce during trade talks in Stockholm. This would prevent the imposition of new tariffs and further escalation of the trade war, as the current suspension is set to expire on August 12. The talks are not anticipated to yield major breakthroughs on core issues like China's industrial overcapacity. However, the Chinese delegation is expected to press the U.S. on its 20% tariffs related to fentanyl, seeking more clarity on what would be required for those specific levies to be eased.</p>

However, the author argues that while this free money should be taken, other established savings vehicles offer superior long-term benefits.

          <p>Recent studies on the four-day workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes from more than just an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a primary factor is that workers feel more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes, eliminate busywork, and focus on high-impact tasks. This heightened sense of professional accomplishment and control over their work contributes significantly to their overall well-being, reduced stress, and improved work-life balance, benefits that spill over into their personal lives.</p>

          <p>Canadian rapper Drake has canceled his scheduled Monday concert in Manchester, UK, with the venue citing "unforeseen ferry schedule and travel logistics" as the reason. The performance, part of a global tour, was announced as canceled on short notice, drawing frustration from fans, some of whom had traveled for the event. The concert has been rescheduled for August 5, and all tickets will remain valid for the new date. Drake had already performed two shows in the city on Friday and Saturday and is still scheduled to perform another concert there on August 4.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party leader, Kemi Badenoch, has announced that her party will ban all NHS doctors from going on strike if it returns to power. The plan involves introducing legislation for minimum service levels, placing doctors under similar restrictions to those on police and military personnel. The announcement comes as thousands of resident doctors are engaged in a five-day strike over pay, which the British Medical Association (BMA) argues has fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008. Badenoch accused the union of becoming increasingly militant, setting the stage for a major confrontation over workers' rights.</p>

They will join 18 returning professionals. The announcement comes after a year of controversies for the program, which led the BBC to implement new welfare measures, including chaperones in rehearsal rooms and additional training for cast and crew.</p>

          <p>In the UK, £274 million in Child Trust Funds (CTFs) designated for young people from low-income backgrounds remain unclaimed, according to The Share Foundation charity. CTFs were government-seeded, tax-free savings accounts for individuals born between September 2002 and January 2011, who can access them at age 18. Many accounts were automatically allocated by the government if families did not act, and are now lying dormant. The charity is calling on the government to create an automatic release mechanism to pay out the funds when account holders turn 21, providing a much-needed financial boost.</p>

          <p>France's long-standing sphere of influence in its former African colonies, known as "Francafrique," is collapsing, particularly in the Sahel region, forcing a major strategic shift for French businesses. This analysis details how French companies, from energy giant Orano to infrastructure firms, are losing their historically preferential treatment and facing intense competition from global rivals like China and Turkey. To survive, many are abandoning their visible, dominant roles and instead adapting by forming joint ventures and local partnerships to maintain market share in a more competitive and politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>Convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has met twice with the Department of Justice, fueling speculation about what she might reveal regarding Jeffrey Epstein's network. This analysis explores the situation amid political pressure on the Trump administration to release Epstein-related files. It questions Maxwell's potential motivations for cooperating, such as seeking a reduced sentence, and weighs them against her questionable credibility, given that she previously faced perjury charges. Experts are divided on whether her testimony could uncover new truths or is merely a political distraction, noting that any information she provides would require significant verification.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical essay proposes that Donald Trump's political and economic philosophy is driven by a singular, insatiable avarice. The author argues that Trump's identity is tied to dealmaking, a process that serves to increase his personal wealth and brand value regardless of whether the deals succeed or fail. This framework is used to explain his approach to international trade, his weaponization of tariffs, and his family's lucrative ventures in the cryptocurrency market. According to the article, Trump's ultimate goal is not power or prestige in themselves, but the endless accumulation of money as an end in itself.</p>

          <p>A travel writer with experience in 70 countries has outlined common phrases used by American tourists that can be perceived as rude, ignorant, or offensive in other cultures. The list includes asking for prices in U.S. dollars, repeatedly asking for American chains like Starbucks, and complimenting someone's English in a predominantly English-speaking country. The author explains the context behind why these phrases can be problematic, such as showing a lack of research or carrying colonial undertones. The advice aims to help travelers be more considerate and culturally aware guests when visiting foreign countries.</p>

While both sides have agreed in principle to halt the fighting that flared up last week, they continue to trade blame for ongoing shelling and troop movements along the contested frontier, making the outcome of the talks uncertain.</p>

          <p>After years of turmoil, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement to stabilize the company. The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers have recently hit an 18-month high, and its stock is up over 30% this year. While significant challenges persist, including an FAA-imposed production cap on the 737 MAX and ongoing delays for new models, key airline customers have expressed renewed confidence in Boeing's quality and predictability.
