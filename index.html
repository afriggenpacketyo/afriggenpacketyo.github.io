          <p>New York Jets receiver Josh Reynolds was shot in the head and leg in October 2024 while he was with the Denver Broncos. A new report citing court documents reveals the incident was a case of mistaken identity, where assailants wrongly targeted Reynolds' group, believing they were involved in a drug deal scam involving counterfeit money. One suspect in the multi-vehicle car chase and shooting has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, with seven other individuals also charged in connection to the violent assault. Reynolds sustained minor injuries and continued his NFL career, later signing with the Jets.</p>

          <p>Russia conducted a massive overnight missile and drone attack across nine Ukrainian regions, resulting in at least three deaths and over 30 injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the strikes deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure, including a multi-story building in Dnipro, calling it a strategy of intimidation. In response, Ukraine targeted Russian energy infrastructure, claiming successful drone strikes on two major oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions. The Ukrainian Air Force reported that it intercepted a significant number of the 619 projectiles launched by Russia, utilizing Western-supplied F-16 fighters.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a software provider owned by RTX, has caused significant disruptions at major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the 'Muse' software used by multiple airlines for electronic check-in and baggage drop, forcing staff to resort to manual processing. This led to long queues, flight delays, and some cancellations, with passengers reporting hours-long waits. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the incident highlights the vulnerability of interconnected global travel systems to digital threats.</p>

The suspects allegedly hurled homophobic slurs before chasing, beating, and choking the victim, who was hospitalized with serious injuries. The attack occurred after the victim reportedly confronted the group for harassing people at a transit center. Police used witness video and surveillance images to identify the suspects, one of whom turned himself in after being recognized by a family member. The case highlights a disturbing instance of targeted violence against the transgender community.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in an extraordinary qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, was repeatedly halted due to numerous crashes, including incidents involving Alex Albon, Nico Hulkenberg, and both Alpine drivers in the first segment alone. The final shootout was further disrupted by crashes from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and McLaren's Oscar Piastri, with light rain adding to the treacherous conditions.

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and have returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in Afghanistan for almost two decades, running a charitable training program. Their release was brokered by Qatar, and they were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London. The Taliban never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention, stating only that the pair had broken Afghan laws. The family had previously expressed grave concerns about the couple's declining health in captivity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These rights were a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel, granting the White House veto power over major operational decisions. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision to idle the plant. This marks the first use of these national-security-related powers, highlighting a direct presidential intervention in corporate strategy to protect American jobs.</p>

Lewinsky connected her experience to the broader cultural reckoning with the misogynistic treatment of women in that era and the subsequent #MeToo movement.

Since President Trump's return to office, there have been only three known transits, which were confirmed by the U.S. only after media inquiries.

          <p>According to Dr. Adam Friedman, a professor of dermatology, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors. While standard window glass typically filters out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, it does not block UVA rays. These UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, contributing to accelerated aging, collagen damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer without any visible burning. Because this exposure is unfelt, Friedman calls it a "silent killer" and recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on days spent primarily inside near windows.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing increasingly expensive grocery bills, with food prices seeing their fastest monthly increase since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three main factors are contributing to this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm labor. Tariffs have raised the cost of imported goods like coffee, while climate change has shifted crop production. Meanwhile, a labor shortage has further increased operational costs, all of which are ultimately passed on to shoppers at the checkout counter.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate, long-term rates, including those for mortgages, unexpectedly increased. Bond traders, viewing the widely anticipated rate cut as a "sell the news" event, sold off long-term bonds, which caused their yields to rise. Economists suggest that bond investors are wary that the Fed may be easing its monetary policy too soon, potentially allowing inflation to persist, which devalues long-term securities. This market reaction demonstrates that the Fed's direct control is primarily over short-term rates, while longer-term rates are influenced by broader market sentiment about future economic health and inflation.

          <p>South African authorities have arrested five North American citizens and a local farm caretaker after discovering a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg. Police acted on a tip about a strange chemical smell and found approximately $20 million worth of crystal meth stored in buckets and freezers. The five foreign nationals, who were in the country illegally, were apprehended while attempting to flee. The operation, which also uncovered precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment, is being hailed as a significant step in combating the region's drug trade.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has called for the creation of emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to tackle the country's significant backlog of asylum claims. The proposal, modeled after the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to speed up application processing and reduce the costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The party's home affairs spokesperson, Lisa Smart, also stated they would double the number of caseworkers to handle the claims. The plan was announced at the party's annual conference as part of a focus on law and order and community policing initiatives.</p>

          <p>A massive 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of approximately 6,000 people from 1,900 households. Police bomb disposal experts conducted a delicate, day-long operation to defuse the nearly five-foot-long device, which concluded successfully with no injuries. The city was a target of Allied air raids during the Japanese occupation in WWII, and the discovery of unexploded ordnance from that era is a recurring, though still dangerous, event in Hong Kong and other former warzones around the world.</p>

          <p>Doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals are highlighting several persistent health "lies" and myths that can lead to poor health decisions. Among the debunked beliefs are the ideas that most people who think they have a penicillin allergy actually do, and that "detox" cleanses are necessary for a healthy body, as the liver and kidneys perform this function naturally. Other critical advice includes not putting substances like butter on severe burns and not removing large foreign objects lodged in the body before seeking medical attention. The professionals stress the importance of annual checkups, even when feeling fine, for early detection of serious conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee on companies for each H-1B visa application for skilled foreign workers, set to take effect September 21. The administration cited "abuse" of the program as the reason for the drastic fee increase, arguing it will encourage companies to hire American workers instead. The move has sparked concern among businesses and immigration lawyers, who warn it will price out small and medium-sized companies and harm U.S. competitiveness in attracting global talent. The H-1B program is heavily used by the tech industry, with companies like Amazon and Microsoft being top beneficiaries.</p>

          <p>Ed Langevin, a retired grandfather, experienced severe pain after eating, nausea, and significant weight loss, which were initially dismissed as simple heartburn. After months of testing, he was diagnosed with chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare and serious condition where blocked arteries restrict blood flow to the small intestine. The condition, which made him afraid to eat, was successfully treated with a minimally invasive stent procedure by Dr. Gabriel Wallace at Northwestern Medicine. Langevin's story highlights the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare and seeking further opinions when symptoms persist and severely impact one's quality of life.</p>

          <p>According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the average math and reading scores for 12th graders in the U.S. have fallen to their lowest levels in decades. The results show a continuation of a downward trend that began before the COVID-19 pandemic, with the lowest-performing students showing the most significant declines. Experts point to a variety of potential causes, including chronic absenteeism, which has worsened since the pandemic. Other contributing factors under discussion include increased smartphone use and social media distraction, declining student engagement, and a lack of focus on foundational reading skills.</p>

          <p>Recent federal budget cuts and policy shifts under the Trump administration have led to widespread layoffs, with Black women being hit particularly hard. This is because Black women are significantly overrepresented in the federal workforce, which has historically been a key pathway to middle-class stability. The article details the experiences of women who have lost their jobs, highlighting the psychological and financial toll of losing what was once considered secure employment. The instability is causing a loss of morale and forcing many to reconsider their career paths, with some leaving the public sector entirely for entrepreneurship.</p>

A hands-on review highlights the device's novel control system: a fuzzy gray wristband that uses EMG sensors to detect hand gestures, allowing users to navigate menus by pinching fingers or adjusting volume by twisting their hand. While the display itself is described as more functional than immersive—useful for reading messages or seeing live captions—the overall experience points toward Meta's long-term vision of glasses replacing smartphones. The innovative neural wristband, in particular, stands out as a key piece of the cutting-edge technology.</p>

This surge is overwhelmingly driven by artificial intelligence, with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI leading the charge. According to Forge Global, AI firms have raised $65 billion so far this year, accounting for 77% of all private-market capital. This easy access to massive funding means these companies have little incentive to go public, reshaping capital flows and creating a powerful new force in the tech economy.

          <p>The article analyzes Bad Bunny's 10-week concert residency in his native Puerto Rico, which invited fans to his home turf rather than touring to them. This model created a unique form of "concert tourism," allowing attendees to immerse themselves in the culture that is central to the artist's identity. However, the event also highlights the complex relationship between tourism and the island's struggles with gentrification, resource shortages, and economic sovereignty. While the residency was a celebration of Puerto Rican pride and was expected to provide an economic boost, it also raised uneasy questions about who ultimately benefits from such large-scale, tourist-dependent events.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement, particularly raids targeting laborers over criminals, has had such a negative economic impact that it has unintentionally highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform. The author notes that the disruption to industries like agriculture and construction has even led some California Republican lawmakers to call for a more sensible approach. By creating economic instability and fear, the current policies are demonstrating the unsustainability of the status quo. The piece suggests that this self-inflicted damage might create the political pressure needed to restart bipartisan conversations on a workable immigration system.</p>

Beyond his iconic on-screen roles in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men," Redford's most lasting impact may be his creation of the Sundance Institute and Film Festival. By championing independent and risk-taking filmmakers, he provided a crucial platform for the careers of artists like the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Ava DuVernay. The article posits that Sundance was Redford's way of recycling his own good fortune to create opportunities for others, ensuring his artistic vision will continue to influence cinema for generations.</p>
