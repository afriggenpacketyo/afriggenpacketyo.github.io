          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly rebuked Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives on social media, telling him to "Shut up" after Ives made several recommendations to Tesla's board. Ives had suggested the board should curb Musk's political activities, particularly his formation of a new "America Party," and establish a new pay package with guardrails. The analyst argued that Musk's divided attention is creating reputational risk for Tesla, which has seen its stock price fall significantly. This public spat underscores ongoing concerns among investors about Musk's leadership and its impact on the company's stability and future.</p>

          <p>A review of college newspaper articles written by New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani reveals his early political views. The articles, penned while he was at Bowdoin College, show his promotion of an academic boycott of Israel and critiques of "white privilege." In one piece, he co-founded a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter and argued for the boycott to pressure Israel over its policies. Mamdani's surprising primary victory has highlighted a rift within the Democratic Party, with his progressive platform including policies like defunding the police and city-run grocery stores, drawing both strong support and significant opposition.</p>

          <p>Amid the catastrophic flooding in Central Texas, a local man named Matthew Crowder is being praised for his heroic actions in rescuing a sleeping family from their home. Crowder was on his way to work in the early morning when he noticed the rapidly rising waters and alerted the family, evacuating them just as their house was being inundated. The family lost their home and car in the flood, which has claimed over 100 lives in the region. Crowder has since been volunteering to help other affected families, highlighting the powerful community response in the face of the disaster.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, in Washington. The discussions focused on the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of hostages. Netanyahu's visit occurs as the Trump administration faces criticism over its recent military strikes against Iran, with some lawmakers seeking to limit further action. The Prime Minister praised the "unmatched" coordination with President Trump, expressing hope for new peace opportunities in the Middle East while emphasizing the need to dismantle Hamas.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to meet soon, homeowners are considering whether to tap into their home equity with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a traditional home equity loan. The decision hinges on expectations for future interest rates, as the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady in 2025 after several cuts in late 2024. A HELOC offers a variable rate that could decrease if the Fed cuts rates, but it also carries the risk of rising. A fixed-rate home equity loan provides stability and predictable payments, which may be preferable if rates are expected to remain high or increase. (not investment advice)</p>

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only justice to publicly dissent, criticizing the majority for second-guessing the lower court's factual findings.

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, offers a new perspective on the life of 1950s Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield. The film challenges the common narrative of Mansfield as merely a Marilyn Monroe imitation, instead portraying her as a talented and shrewd woman with serious acting ambitions. It explores how she navigated the restrictive studio system, which typecast her as a "bombshell," and how her career waned as Hollywood's culture shifted. The documentary serves as both an affectionate tribute and a critical look at an industry that often limited the potential of its female stars.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University for records on its foreign students, escalating a conflict with the institution. The move follows an earlier demand for information on students' alleged "illegal and violent" activities, which the administration deemed Harvard's response to be insufficient. In retaliation, the government had tried to revoke the university's ability to enroll international students, a move blocked by a federal judge. The administration accuses Harvard of allowing visa abuse and has also threatened its accreditation, citing a failure to address alleged antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>According to a new report based on audio from a donor meeting, former President Donald Trump claimed he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" if Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. The audio, detailed in a forthcoming book, also captures Trump saying he made similar threats to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding Taiwan. The alleged threats were made during his presidency, and he recounted them at a May 2024 fundraiser, suggesting his unpredictable approach kept adversaries in check. The White House responded by stating that Russia did not invade Ukraine during Trump's term, attributing it to his "peace through strength" leadership.</p>

          <p>Amid record numbers of migrants crossing the English Channel, an analysis explores the "pull factors" attracting asylum seekers to the UK. While the French government suggests the UK's informal economy is a major draw, data indicates it is smaller than France's. UK policies on asylum seekers' right to work are actually more restrictive than in many EU countries. Research suggests that the ability to speak English and the presence of family or community ties are more significant drivers. The perception of the UK as a good place to live, often promoted by smugglers, also plays a crucial role in their decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has launched its annual Han Kuang military exercises, which are the largest and longest in the nation's history, scheduled to last for ten days. The drills are designed to test the island's defense capabilities against a potential invasion from China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. This year's exercises include new elements, such as countering Chinese coast guard harassment and conducting urban resilience drills in supermarkets to practice civilian responses to an attack. The heightened maneuvers reflect growing tensions across the Taiwan Strait, with Beijing warning that any attempt to seek independence by force will fail.</p>

          <p>Many victims of the Los Angeles wildfires are now experiencing what psychologists term "delayed grief," with the emotional impact hitting harder months after the initial crisis has passed. As the immediate scramble for housing and essentials subsides, the finality of the loss becomes more palpable. A therapist explains that resilient individuals often postpone grief out of necessity, but the feelings eventually surface once life settles into a new, altered reality. Coping strategies include connecting with others who share the experience, making time to process emotions, and acknowledging that healing is not a linear process.</p>

          <p>As savers look to maximize returns in a shifting interest rate environment, a comparison between a long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a money market account reveals nuanced differences. While current money market account rates are slightly higher, yielding more interest over various timeframes in a static model, they are variable and likely to decrease with anticipated Fed rate cuts. In contrast, a long-term CD locks in a fixed rate, offering predictable and secure earnings over the term. The choice depends on an individual's risk tolerance and their outlook on future interest rate movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the team, primarily because it has become too expensive. Manning noted that with NFL team valuations soaring, even a small percentage represents a very large investment. The Giants were recently valued at over $7.8 billion, with other teams seeing sales at even higher valuations. Manning also mentioned potential conflicts of interest with his broadcasting role on ESPN's "ManningCast" as another factor in his decision, though he plans to remain actively involved with the Giants organization in other capacities.</p>

This legal action follows a threat from the Trump administration in June after a transgender high school student won two state track-and-field events. The administration argues the policies are unconstitutional, escalating a contentious national debate over transgender rights and participation in sports.</p>
