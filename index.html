        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging his executive order that seeks to eliminate the broadcaster's federal funding. The lawsuit argues that Trump's actions are retaliatory due to perceived political slights in news coverage and violate both the U.S. Constitution and federal telecommunications law. PBS asserts that the president is legally barred from interfering with the broadcaster's funding or content, citing protections of speech and press freedom. The White House maintains that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is using taxpayer money to support a particular political party, justifying the President's authority to limit funding. The lawsuit aims to protect PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations, arguing that the order smacks of retaliation for perceived political slights in news coverage. The optimism score reflects the severity of the attack on the freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Maj. Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series "M*A*S*H," has passed away at the age of 87. Swit died at her home in New York City, reportedly from natural causes. She won two Emmy Awards for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated for several other awards during her time on the show. Swit wanted to portray Houlihan as a real person, even if it meant hurting the jokes, and she felt the character was constantly developing. The show was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, a landmark celebrated for its freewheeling humor, its satirical approach to war movies, the excess of blood in the operating room and the nudity of its nurses. The passing of a beloved actress brings reflection on her life and work.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy by maintaining its advice that children may receive COVID-19 shots. This decision counters Kennedy's earlier announcement that the vaccine would no longer be included on the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC's update reinforces the importance of COVID-19 vaccines for children and pregnant women, despite Kennedy's stance. The CDC's decision shows the agency's commitment to scientific recommendations, even when facing political pressure. The agency's action may help to stabilize the health of children.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report, which addresses chronic diseases in children, is under scrutiny due to the citation of nonexistent studies. NOTUS found that several cited studies were never published, and some were misinterpreted, raising concerns about the report's credibility. The problematic citations involved topics such as children's screen time, medication use, and anxiety. The White House has acknowledged the issues and promised to update the report, while CBS News medical contributor Dr. CÃ©line Gounder described the errors as unethical and potentially AI-generated. The report is intended to inform policy recommendations and has a requested $500 million funding boost from Congress, making the accuracy of its sources critical. The report is a negative reflection of the US government.</p>

Thousands have been evacuated from their homes, and both provinces have declared states of emergency.

Smoke from the fires has triggered air quality alerts in Canada and the U.S. Upper Midwest, including Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, with residents warned of potentially unhealthy conditions. International crews, including firefighters from the U.S., are assisting in the firefighting efforts. The fires are a tragic reality, but humanity is coming together to combat the wildfires.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his announcement of a "partnership" deal with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the structure of the deal, which Trump described as an investment with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh and Nippon investing $14 billion. The White House has provided limited details since Trump's announcement, and there are concerns about the implications for national security and supply chains. Senator Dave McCormick indicated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" to ensure U.S. control over production levels and board appointments.

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump commended Musk's efforts to overhaul the federal government, although DOGE's claimed savings of $170 billion fall short of Musk's initial $1 trillion promise. An analysis suggested that DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and workforce changes. Musk, who wore a DOGE baseball cap and a "DOGEfather" t-shirt to the Oval Office meeting, will continue to advise the president. Musk publicly criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," citing concerns about increased deficit spending. The meeting highlighted the complex relationship between the president and the billionaire, marked by both collaboration and divergence on policy matters. Musk's departure will lead to economic growth.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a third suspect, Christian Anderson, in connection with the drugging and robbery death of Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, who was in Louisiana to cover the Super Bowl.

The arrest follows those of Danette Colbert, charged with second-degree murder, and Rickey White, arrested on robbery and fraud charges related to Manzano's death. Police allege that a car used by Colbert was rented under Anderson's name, and evidence suggests Anderson provided logistical support and assisted in attempts to financially benefit from Manzano's stolen assets.

Musk responded to the question by questioning the credibility of the New York Times, referencing a judge's ruling against the publication regarding its reporting on Russia-gate. The New York Times article had alleged Musk's consumption of ketamine and other substances. Musk's deflection avoids addressing the allegations directly, shifting the focus to the reporter's publication.

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether Ramon Morales Reyes, the man accused of threatening to shoot and kill President Trump, may have been framed. Reyes, an undocumented migrant, allegedly wrote a threatening letter to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, leading to his arrest. However, law enforcement sources indicate that a handwriting test did not match the letter, and Reyes may have been involved in a dispute with another man seeking to avoid testifying against him. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem initially praised the arrest but has not commented on the possibility of a setup. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating an identity theft and victim intimidation incident related to the case. The investigation into the threat is ongoing, and Reyes remains in custody due to his illegal status and criminal record.

          <p>LinkedIn has cut 281 workers in California as part of broader layoffs affecting the tech industry. The layoffs, which were announced earlier this month by Microsoft, affected employees at LinkedIn's offices in San Francisco, Mountain View, Carpinteria, and Sunnyvale. Software engineers were particularly impacted by the job cuts. The cuts come as tech companies release more AI-powered tools and aim to reduce redundancies. The layoffs are part of a cost-cutting effort at LinkedIn, which previously laid off nearly 700 employees in 2023. There is hope that the employees will find new work.</p>

          <p>Amy Jones scored her first international century in a match against the West Indies, marking a significant milestone in her 12-year career. Playing in England's first one-day international under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards, Jones' century came after 225 matches and 190 innings. Edwards' tactical decision to promote Jones back up the order proved successful, as Jones repaid the faith with a strong performance. Jones expressed both relief and pride in achieving the century, especially after having opened for England previously. The match is a victory for the team.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel are awaiting a response from Hamas to a 60-day ceasefire proposal for Gaza, according to the White House. Israel has signed off on the proposal, which was submitted by special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump. Under the proposed deal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages, while Israel would release 125 "life sentence" prisoners and 1,111 Palestinian detainees. Humanitarian aid would be sent into Gaza immediately upon Hamas' agreement to the deal. Negotiations for a permanent ceasefire would begin on the first day of the agreement, discussing issues such as the withdrawal of Israeli forces and long-term security within Gaza. This is a potential step towards peace.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst defended proposed Medicaid cuts at a town hall meeting, responding to concerns that the cuts would cause people to die by stating, "Well, we all are going to die." Ernst explained that the focus would be on protecting those who are most vulnerable and meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. She argued that those who are working and have access to benefits elsewhere should receive them there, freeing up resources for those who are eligible for Medicaid. The House version of the bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aims to implement Medicaid reforms and extend the Trump 2017 tax cuts. The issue is a complex one, and the public is divided.</p>

Raskin asked for an explanation of the criteria used to vet recent pardons, noting that some recipients have expressed support for Trump or donated to pro-Trump committees. He claims that the new criteria for granting pardons appear to be loyalty to Trump, financial contributions, and promotion of MAGA power.

          <p>A prison officer at HMP Long Lartin, a high-security prison in Worcestershire, underwent emergency surgery after being stabbed by an inmate. Emergency teams were called to the prison on Friday morning, and the officer is now in a stable condition. Police are investigating the incident, which they believe was an isolated matter resulting from a disagreement between the officer and the inmate. The prison houses more than 600 inmates, including those convicted of terrorism offenses. The officer's condition is stable.</p>
