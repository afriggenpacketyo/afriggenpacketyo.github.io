          <p>Vance Luther Boelter was apprehended in a rural area of Sibley County, Minnesota, as the suspect in the shooting of Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed in what authorities called a "politically motivated assassination." Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack; both were in stable condition. Boelter was armed but taken into custody without violence after a large manhunt involving over 20 SWAT teams. Authorities believe Boelter acted alone, wearing a latex mask and a law enforcement-style uniform during the attacks.</p>

          <p>The Senate is unlikely to debate and vote on the "big, beautiful bill" until the week of June 22, potentially jeopardizing its final passage through the Senate and House by July 4. The Senate Finance Committee is expected to release its text of the bill as early as Monday, with key tax provisions like SALT reductions, potential spending cuts, and changes to Medicare and Medicaid included. The Senate Parliamentarian will then begin weeding out provisions that do not comply with Senate Budget rules. If the Senate advances the bill, the House will have a tight window to either accept the changes or send it back to the Senate, potentially delaying the process beyond the July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>The article examines the ongoing debate over energy efficiency standards for appliances in the United States, highlighting how political viewpoints impact these regulations. While energy efficiency has historically improved with tightened regulations, recent administrations have either pushed for stricter standards or rolled them back, citing concerns about functionality and consumer choice. The Trump administration has rescinded numerous energy-efficiency rules, arguing that market-driven innovation leads to better products, while critics argue this could lead to higher utility bills. The article also notes the appliance industry's reliance on federal standards to streamline expectations and avoid a patchwork of state regulations, highlighting the complexities of balancing energy conservation with consumer needs and economic realities.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains caused flash flooding in northern West Virginia, resulting in at least five deaths, including a 3-year-old child, and several missing people. Officials reported 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about half an hour, overwhelming local waterways and infrastructure. Rescue crews conducted multiple water rescues, but damage to roads and bridges hampered their efforts. Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion Counties, directing state police and the National Guard to assist.

The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename U.S. Steel, transfer production or jobs outside the U.S., and close or idle plants before certain time frames. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with all regulatory approvals received and the transaction expected to be completed promptly.

Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement the consensus reached in Geneva last month, addressing rare earths, Chinese student visas, and U.S. exports of jet engine parts to China. Both sides expressed positive sentiments about the outcome, with Trump calling it “a great deal.” Experts suggest that the progress in London could pave the way for the resumption of important dialogue mechanisms disrupted in recent years.</p>

          <p>The Asian needle ant, an insect with a potent bite, continues its march across the US, prompting increased awareness of the risks it poses. Unlike fire ants, Asian needle ants are not aggressive, but their sting can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals. The ants colonize in undisturbed forest areas and near homes, nesting under logs, stones, and mulch. While difficult to control, they can disrupt natural ecosystems and may not have natural predators. Experts advise taking precautions such as wearing gloves and shoes when gardening and cleaning up woody debris.</p>

          <p>New York City's congestion pricing policy, implemented in January, has shown early signs of success in reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit, though it faces ongoing political threats. The $9 toll for entering lower Manhattan has led to an average of 70,000 fewer vehicles entering the congestion zone each day, and bus routes through Manhattan are moving up to 20% faster. The toll is expected to raise $500 million annually for upgrades to the city's public transit system. Despite these successes, the program faces opposition from conservatives, with the Trump administration seeking to revoke federal approval, raising questions about states' rights and the limits of federal power.</p>

Many young individuals express a desire for genuine connection and intimacy but find current options unappealing, such as the cycle of love-bombing and ghosting or anonymous hookups. The rise of online interactions and "talking stages" has led to more verbal than physical relationships, often lacking clear boundaries or commitment. The pandemic has further shaped social development, with increased screen time and emotional risk-aversion contributing to a preference for online interactions over in-person connections.</p>

An area of high pressure is building across the UK, leading to increasingly hot conditions later in the week. For the Met Office to declare a heatwave, threshold temperatures must be reached for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in parts of eastern England. While warm spells have occurred recently, they haven't been long enough to qualify as a heatwave.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the importance of countries setting and achieving climate targets to prevent global overheating, highlighting Kenya's success in generating 90% of its electricity from sustainable sources and its pledge to use 100% renewables by 2035. Domestic climate targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are a key part of the Paris Agreement, obliging signatories to submit ambitious goals every five years. While many countries have yet to file their most recent climate goals, experts emphasize that action from the biggest emitters, including the G20, is crucial. Despite challenges such as financial constraints and competing priorities, the article suggests that the mechanisms of the Paris Agreement have made a significant change globally.</p>

          <p>Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has criticized former leader Ma Ying-jeou for his comments at the Straits Forum in Fujian province, accusing him of undermining Taiwan’s political standing. Ma reiterated that only by adhering to the “1992 consensus” and opposing Taiwan independence could both sides of the Taiwan Strait achieve a peaceful outcome. The DPP views the annual cross-strait forum as a centrepiece of Beijing’s “united front” operations, which aim to extend the Communist Party’s influence beyond mainland China. Ma's remarks were echoed by Wang Huning, a high-ranking official in the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>China's consumer spending is showing little sign of recovery due to uncertainty about future wealth, changing consumer preferences, and a lack of a robust social safety net. Declining consumer prices and low consumer confidence are contributing factors, along with stagnant income growth. Disposable income growth has slowed since the pandemic, and unemployment among young people remains high. Chinese authorities have stepped up plans to support employment and improve social welfare, but they have avoided mass cash handouts.

          <p>The article discusses how some conservative women are embracing the "lean in" philosophy, arguing that women can have both a career and children. This contrasts with traditional conservative views that encourage women to prioritize motherhood. These women express frustration with those on the right who encourage women to devote themselves fully to housekeeping and child-rearing. They advocate for policies that support working mothers, such as remote work and federal parental leave. The shift may reflect a practical calculation that supporting women's career aspirations is necessary to raise fertility rates and persuade women to avoid abortion.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to drop live mosquitoes into remote forests as part of a project to combat avian malaria, which threatens the state's endangered forest birds. The mosquitoes being released are male and contain a strain of bacteria called wolbachia that interferes with reproduction, causing eggs to fail to hatch when they mate with local females. This approach aims to erode the population of biting mosquitoes and suppress the spread of disease. The project, led by environmental organizations, has released millions of mosquitoes across Maui and Kauai, and drones are being tested as a safer and more efficient alternative to helicopters for deployment.</p>

Despite its impact, the tracking of methane emissions is less precise than that of carbon dioxide, with limited measurement-based data used in reporting. Researchers are working to better understand methane sources, revealing that coal mines and small oil and gas facilities are underappreciated contributors. Many low-cost tools to halt methane emissions are available but underutilized, while the Trump administration's push for more fossil fuel development could exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>Millions of people who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are bracing for potential changes, including restrictions on food purchases and program cuts. The Trump administration is allowing more states to ban the use of benefits to buy sugary foods and drinks, while the budget reconciliation bill includes deep cuts to the program. Analysis from the Congressional Budget Office suggests these cuts would reduce SNAP by nearly $300 billion, potentially affecting one in four recipients. New work requirements and restrictions on food choices are also causing concern among SNAP recipients.</p>
