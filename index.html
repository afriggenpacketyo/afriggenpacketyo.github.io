        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey have concluded their case is significantly undermined by a central witness. Law professor Daniel Richman, whom prosecutors alleged Comey used for leaks, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to speak to the media anonymously and, in fact, advised against it on two occasions. This testimony creates what investigators called "likely insurmountable problems" for the prosecution, as detailed in a memo recommending against charging Comey, though a politically appointed prosecutor proceeded with the indictment anyway.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was dropped because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a "threat to national security." This designation became a necessary legal threshold following a precedent set in another spying case. Despite months of requests, prosecutors could not obtain witness statements from the government meeting this standard, leading to the collapse of the trial. The situation has sparked criticism and speculation about the government's geopolitical motivations.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have intercepted a nine-vessel aid flotilla carrying food, medical supplies, and 150 international activists in an attempt to breach the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, confirmed the vessels were stopped in international waters, with passengers expected to be detained and deported. Israel's foreign ministry described the incident as another "futile attempt" to enter a combat zone, while Turkey condemned the interception as a "grave violation of international law." This event occurs amid a dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where a UN-backed body has confirmed famine conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has reached a historic high, surpassing $4,000 an ounce, as investors seek safe-haven assets due to worldwide economic and political uncertainty. This rally, the largest since the 1970s, is fueled by concerns over global trade disputes and delays in US economic data releases caused by the ongoing government shutdown. Analysts note that the surge is also driven by strategic purchases from central banks moving away from US treasuries and increased buying from retail investors.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed Assembly Bill 255, a bipartisan proposal that would have allocated up to 10% of state homelessness funds for abstinence-based recovery housing. The bill's supporters argue such programs offer community and accountability for homeless individuals with substance use disorders, providing an alternative to the state's "Housing First" policy. Newsom justified the veto by calling the bill "unnecessary" and "duplicative," stating that current guidelines already permit sober housing. Critics, as presented in this article, contend the decision is a moral failure that prioritizes ideology over effective solutions to the state's severe homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, is scheduled for his first court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, to be arraigned on federal charges of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional investigation. The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony where he denied authorizing anonymous media sources within the FBI. The case is seen by many as a significant development in Donald Trump's efforts to influence the Justice Department, particularly since the charges were brought by a hand-picked prosecutor after career officials reportedly found insufficient evidence. Comey maintains his innocence and has stated he is being targeted for political reasons.</p>

          <p>The pumpkin, a quintessential symbol of autumn, has a complex history that extends beyond its agricultural roots in the Americas. The word itself evolved from the Greek "pepon" to the French "pompon" before becoming the English "pompion" and finally "pumpkin." For centuries, the word was also used as an insult, suggesting a woman was driven by base urges or a man was empty-headed. By the late 19th century, as the US urbanized, the pumpkin was rehabilitated into a nostalgic symbol of agrarian life and the small family farm, a cultural connection that persists today.</p>

          <p>A new research paper challenges the long-held belief that Sir Ernest Shackleton's polar exploration vessel, the Endurance, was an exceptionally strong ship for its time. Jukka Tuhkuri, a professor of arctic marine technology, argues that the ship had several structural weaknesses that made it unsuitable for the compressive forces of pack ice. The analysis, based on historical records and technical drawings, suggests the ship was originally designed for Arctic tourism, not deep polar exploration, and lacked key structural supports. Shackleton himself reportedly expressed doubts about its construction, noting in a letter that it was not as strong as his previous ship, the Nimrod.</p>

Immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa face significant economic disparities, including higher unemployment and lower wages, which are exacerbated by hiring discrimination.

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to significantly increase tariffs on imported steel, a move that the UK's steel industry warns could trigger its "biggest crisis." The EU intends to halve the quota for steel imports, after which a steep 50% tariff will apply. As the EU is the UK's primary export market for steel, representing nearly £3 billion in trade, the industry is urging the government to negotiate a specific country quota to avoid disaster. The EU's action is partly a response to US tariffs and protectionist measures from other nations, which risk redirecting excess steel into the UK market.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has agreed to purchase the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, a strategic move to enhance its position in the field of artificial intelligence. The acquisition aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision for "Physical AI," which aims to fuse advanced robotics with Artificial Super Intelligence. This deal provides ABB with approximately $5.3 billion in cash proceeds and cancels its previous plans to spin off the robotics unit. For SoftBank, the purchase adds to its portfolio of AI-related investments, which includes chip designer Arm and a stake in OpenAI.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of people affected by the car finance mis-selling scandal, with average payouts estimated at £700 per claim. The scheme addresses 14 million agreements made between 2007 and 2024 involving undisclosed commissions, unfair contracts, and inaccurate information, with total lender payouts potentially reaching £8.2 billion. The FCA has proposed a free-to-access system where lenders will contact affected customers. The lending industry has contested the scale of the compensation, suggesting the regulator's estimates are too high.</p>

          <p>American golfer Collin Morikawa has commented that the behavior of some US fans at the recent Ryder Cup in New York "probably crossed the line." Europe's victory was marred by reports of verbal abuse directed at their team, with Rory McIlroy being a primary target and his wife being hit by a thrown cup. Morikawa, who had previously called on fans to create "chaos," clarified that he did not intend for them to be rude or abusive. The incidents have raised questions about fan conduct and sportsmanship at the highly charged international tournament.</p>

          <p>A two-year-old boy was killed by two Rottweiler dogs at an unlicensed home daycare center in Valdosta, Georgia. According to police, the daycare owner, Stacy Wheeler Cobb, left the child unattended for over two hours while she napped, during which time he apparently entered the backyard and opened the dogs' kennel. Cobb has since been charged with second-degree murder and cruelty to children. The boy's mother stated that camera footage showed the dogs mauling her child.

          <p>Major airports across the United States are experiencing significant flight delays for a second consecutive day due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, a direct consequence of the ongoing federal government shutdown. Although considered essential, controllers are working without pay, leading to an increase in sick leave and reduced staffing levels. The Federal Aviation Administration has been forced to slow down air traffic to maintain safety, resulting in over 3,000 delayed flights. Analysts warn that if the shutdown continues, it could severely disrupt travel for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.</p>

This article explores his technical skills, noting his powerful distribution and improved play with his feet, as well as his maturing temperament on the pitch. Former teammates and goalkeeping experts credit his consistency and ability to perform under pressure in major tournaments for silencing earlier criticisms. Having made only one error leading to a goal in over 78 international appearances, his reliability has ended the debate over who should be England's top keeper.</p>

Hamas is reportedly seeking firm guarantees that Israel will not resume fighting after an initial hostage release.

Investment banks have raised their price forecasts, citing the likelihood of continued central bank purchases and inflows from Western investors.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is navigating an increasingly fragmented and polarized European Parliament, facing two no-confidence votes in just three months. The challenges come from both the far-right and far-left, who criticize her policies on migration, climate, and foreign affairs. While she is expected to survive the votes, the situation reveals a fragile trust between the Commission and even centrist parties. Analysts attribute the tension to the rise of extremist forces, a breakdown in cooperation between traditional center-right and center-left blocs, and criticism of von der Leyen's centralized leadership style.</p>
