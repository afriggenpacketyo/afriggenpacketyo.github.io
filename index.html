          <p>At least two firefighters were killed in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after being shot at while responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain. Law enforcement officials reported they were actively taking sniper fire from a suspect using high-powered rifles, creating a dangerous and volatile situation. The ongoing wildfire smoke and the presence of civilians on the mountain complicated efforts to locate the shooter. Authorities stated they were prepared to neutralize the suspect to ensure public safety in what could become a multi-day operation.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted for the third straight month in June, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remaining below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. This downturn reflects ongoing challenges from a supply glut, weak consumer demand, and the impact of U.S. tariffs, increasing pressure on Beijing for further economic stimulus. While the non-manufacturing sector showed slight growth, persistent deflationary pressures and falling industrial profits highlight significant headwinds for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a massive spending and tax bill championed by President Trump, facing significant division within the Republican party. Senator Thom Tillis vocally opposed the legislation, arguing its cuts to Medicaid would break the president's promises and harm his constituents. Despite pressure from Trump, who urged Republicans not to make excessive cuts, the bill's passage remains uncertain due to shaky support and a new Congressional Budget Office report estimating it would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. Contradicting claims that the program was "obliterated," Grossi emphasized that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild if it chooses. He stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites to verify what materials and capabilities remain, noting that military action alone cannot definitively solve the issue.</p>

The inquiry will also investigate issues like blanket "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies, with care staff and families seeking accountability for what they describe as one of the pandemic's clearest failures.</p>

The crackdown reflects President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, which human rights groups warn has created a hostile environment and led to a rise in discrimination and violence in the country.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving vegetation fire, dubbed the Mandalay fire, burned over 80 acres in Riverside, California, prompting mandatory evacuation orders for residents in the affected areas. The Riverside Fire Department, along with mutual-aid companies and Cal Fire, responded to the four-alarm blaze, which produced heavy smoke visible across the city. While firefighters managed to slow the forward progress of the flames, the fire remained active, and an evacuation center was established at a local senior center to assist displaced residents.</p>

          <p>Actor Vin Diesel has announced that the final film in the "Fast & Furious" franchise will feature the return of Brian O'Conner, the character played by the late Paul Walker. Speaking at a fan event, Diesel said he made the character's return a condition for the finale, which is planned for April 2027. It remains unclear how the production will accomplish this, but it follows a trend of using digital effects and archival footage to include deceased actors in major franchises, a practice that continues to generate debate.</p>
