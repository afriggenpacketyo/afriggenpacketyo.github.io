Despite the difficulties, Novogratz stated that the experience hardened Galaxy Digital, which primarily funded itself through investment gains and trading.

          <p>The article reports a 13% increase in Social Security claims this fiscal year, driven by retirees' anxieties about the Trump administration's changes to the Social Security Administration and broader economic uncertainty. This trend is concerning, as claiming early generally results in lower lifetime payments. Agency officials acknowledged that fear-mongering has influenced retirees' decisions, with higher earners also claiming earlier than in the past. The article advises viewing Social Security as longevity insurance and considering the benefits of delaying claims for a higher payout later in life. </p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that the Republican tax plan may disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans while potentially harming those with lower incomes. The plan's tax cuts and federal spending cuts on programs like Medicaid and food stamps could reduce after-tax income for individuals making less than $51,000 per year beginning in 2026. The top 0.1 percent, with incomes over $4.3 million, would gain an average of more than $389,000 in after-tax income in 2026, benefiting from tax cuts and favorable changes for businesses. </p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris in both Friday practice sessions at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, securing a McLaren one-two. Piastri finished the day just 0.025 seconds ahead of Norris. Pierre Gasly of Alpine was a surprising third-quickest, followed by George Russell of Mercedes, Max Verstappen of Red Bull, and Charles Leclerc of Ferrari. Lewis Hamilton, struggling with braking feel, was 11th fastest. While Ferrari appeared to struggle for speed on a single qualifying lap, Leclerc and Hamilton seemed competitive with the McLarens for race pace later in the session. </p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a significant setback as conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Republican representatives, including Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, opposed the legislation, arguing that it does not adequately slash federal spending. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day, despite disagreements within his party. The bill would extend tax cuts from Mr. Trump's first term while temporarily enacting new ones, offset partly by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy subsidies. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination in a since-deleted social media post featuring the numbers "8647". The numbers were interpreted by Trump's supporters as a call to "86," or get rid of, the 47th president of the United States. Trump said Comey knew exactly what the numbers meant and was calling for the assassination of the president. Comey has denied that his Instagram post was a threat to Trump, stating he was unaware of the association of those numbers with violence. </p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting and deleting a photo on Instagram that federal officials alleged was a call for violence against President Trump. The image showed seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," which some interpreted as referring to Trump's status as the 47th president and the slang term "eighty-six," meaning "eject" or "remove." Comey later deleted the image and said he didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the issue is under investigation. </p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to its second-lowest level on record in May, according to a University of Michigan survey, as Americans grow increasingly worried about tariffs leading to higher inflation. The index of consumer sentiment fell to 50.8, down from 52.2 in April, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3%. The survey was mostly completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, which appears to be a key factor weighing on consumer sentiment. The final consumer sentiment index for the month is slated to be released on May 30. </p>
