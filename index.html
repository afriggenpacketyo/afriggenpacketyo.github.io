          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently located far from land, the storm is moving west-northwest with sustained winds of 50 mph and is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Thursday. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for several northern Leeward Islands, including Antigua, Barbuda, and St. Martin, which are on its projected path. While not a threat to Florida, the system is anticipated to bring heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions to the affected Caribbean islands later this week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal government shutdown is expected to have a severe impact on the commercial real estate market, extending beyond the immediate disruption to residential home sales. The shutdown halts the release of crucial economic data, such as employment and construction reports, which investors and lenders rely on for decision-making. This creates market uncertainty, potentially leading to tighter credit, delayed financing, and reduced demand for commercial properties as businesses and government agencies postpone leasing and development. Sectors like retail and hospitality will face immediate effects from reduced consumer spending, especially in areas with a high concentration of federal workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have been deployed to an Army Reserve Training Center in a Chicago suburb, a move confirmed after Texas Governor Greg Abbott shared a photo of the troops boarding a plane. The deployment, authorized by President Trump, has been met with strong opposition from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have labeled it an unnecessary and dangerous federal overreach. Pritzker stated he would use every available tool to resist what he called an authoritarian action, while Johnson accused the Trump administration of intentionally fomenting chaos in the city.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell sharply following the European Commission's announcement of plans to increase steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The proposed measures, intended to protect the EU's domestic steel industry, would double tariffs to 50% on excess imports and have sparked panic within the automotive sector. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) criticized the proposal, warning that it threatens automakers with higher costs and could have an inflationary impact on European market prices. BMW's stock was particularly hard-hit, dropping around 8% after the company also issued a profit warning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is scheduled for arraignment in a federal courthouse in Northern Virginia on charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation. The indictment stems from testimony he gave in 2020 regarding his authorization of an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source for news reports. Comey, who has maintained his innocence, will formally hear the charges and enter a plea.

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, has revealed that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was dropped because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This clarification came after the case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry collapsed, prompting criticism from politicians. Parkinson explained that a legal precedent required this specific designation for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, and despite months of requests, witness statements from the government did not meet this new, higher threshold.</p>

Tregonning initially told police his ex-partner might have taken the car after an argument, but doorbell footage showed him leaving his home in the vehicle just before the crash. He eventually admitted to being the driver, stating he fled police because the car was uninsured, and was sentenced to over three years in prison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that deploying the National Guard to cities like Chicago is a temporary measure that signals a deeper crisis in policing, not a sustainable public safety strategy. The author contends that years of political cuts, unfilled vacancies, and outdated, bureaucratic hiring processes have depleted police forces, creating the gaps that troops are now being sent to fill. Instead of relying on military intervention, the article calls for modernizing police recruitment with tools like applicant tracking systems, which are common in the private sector. It suggests that investing in building a robust and qualified police force is the only way to ensure long-term community safety.</p>

Prominent Australian cricket figures have suggested his record down under prevents him from being considered an "all-time great." Root, however, remains focused on the team's performance in the upcoming Ashes series, asserting that his personal run-scoring is only important if it contributes to an England victory. He expressed excitement about approaching the tour without the burden of captaincy and with a different team strategy, which he believes gives England its best chance of winning in years.</p>

          <p>As overall mortgage demand continues to weaken, borrowers still in the market are increasingly opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage application volume fell by 4.7% last week, with refinancing applications dropping 8%. However, the share of ARM applications rose to 9.5% of total volume, as their interest rates are averaging nearly a full percentage point below those of 30-year fixed-rate loans. This trend indicates that homebuyers are willing to accept the long-term risk of fluctuating rates in exchange for immediate savings on their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of preordering books provides a significant advantage to authors that goes beyond an early sale. Strong preorder numbers are a key metric that booksellers use to gauge a title's potential success, influencing decisions on how many copies to stock and whether to feature the book prominently in stores or online. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which can create a snowball effect by increasing the likelihood of landing on a bestseller list, thereby generating more visibility and subsequent sales. This initial momentum can be critical in determining the overall trajectory and success of a new book in a competitive market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has established a legal framework to impose retaliatory restrictions on foreign vessels, but the U.S. shipping industry is expected to face minimal impact from such measures. According to research from Linerlytica, the U.S.-operated fleet in China is significantly smaller than the Chinese fleet's exposure to U.S. ports. If China were to implement reciprocal fees based on net tonnage, U.S. operators would pay an estimated $180 million, compared to the $1.15 billion that Chinese operators face from new U.S. tariffs. This disparity is due to the substantial decline in U.S. shipbuilding and the limited number of U.S.-flagged ships that call at Chinese ports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has promised a "marathon of reforms" to address a budget shortfall exceeding €30 billion. As the most senior Social Democrat in the conservative-led coalition, Klingbeil stated that his party would support cuts to welfare benefits but would also insist on higher taxes for top earners to ensure the measures are fair. He emphasized that these changes cannot be limited to a single season of reforms, as proposed by a coalition partner. Instead, he called for a sustained effort throughout the parliamentary term to tackle bureaucracy and accelerate planning processes to put the country's finances on a stable footing.</p>

Omar stated that the bill is a necessary measure to support working parents who are being treated as expendable.

          <p>An artist in Los Angeles' Glassell Park neighborhood has transformed his modest 1946 bungalow into a dynamic home, gallery, and studio space through a clever renovation. Initially planning only to add a small Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) to his garage for a larger studio, the owner worked with a designer to reimagine the entire property. The project involved removing a central fireplace, raising the living room ceiling, adding a loft bedroom, and redesigning the home's connection to the backyard. This series of strategic changes, without a massive increase in square footage, has created an efficient, light-filled, and flexible living environment that seamlessly integrates art and life.</p>
