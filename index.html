          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, aiming to curtail the Kremlin's war funding and pressure Moscow toward peace negotiations in Ukraine. This action follows a similar move by the UK and comes as peace talks have stalled, with the Trump administration citing Russia's lack of honest engagement. The sanctions target a significant portion of Russia's oil production, which constitutes 6% of the global output. The move is intended to support diplomatic efforts to freeze the current front lines and achieve an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon delivered a marathon 22-hour and 37-minute speech on the Senate floor to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He began speaking on Tuesday evening and continued until Wednesday afternoon, criticizing actions such as deportation efforts and the potential deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland. Merkley described the moment as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," asserting that the president is undermining the Constitution. The address, one of the longest in recent Senate history, occurred amid a prolonged government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines exceeded Wall Street expectations by posting a surprise third-quarter profit and projecting record sales for the final quarter of the year. The carrier anticipates a 1% to 3% rise in unit revenue, driven by strong travel demand and higher fares, despite reaffirming a lowered full-year profit forecast from earlier in the year. The company's adjusted earnings were 11 cents per share on $6.95 billion in revenue, outperforming analysts' predictions of a loss. This positive outlook comes as the airline implements strategic changes to better compete with its rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Members of the former Biden administration, including ex-Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, are urging U.S. industrial policy to focus on strategic, cutting-edge technologies rather than attempting a wholesale revival of all manufacturing sectors. Speaking at a Harvard Kennedy School event, Raimondo emphasized the necessity of policies like the CHIPS Act for national security but argued against trying to onshore industries where the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage, such as making baby car seats. This perspective contrasts with the current administration's broader goal to bring all manufacturing back to America, highlighting a key debate in U.S. economic strategy.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and ending a two-quarter streak of declines, though its adjusted earnings of 50 cents per share fell short of analyst estimates. The company's net income dropped 37% year-over-year, attributed to lower EV prices and increased operating expenses for R&D projects in AI and robotics. The quarter saw a sales rush as consumers sought to capitalize on federal EV tax credits before they expired. Despite a sales slump in Europe, Tesla's energy generation and storage business saw significant growth, with revenue jumping 44%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Broderick Jones addressed the controversial touchdown celebration where he tackled 41-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers, causing Rodgers to react angrily. Jones stated that there is "no love lost" between them and that they have since joked about the incident, which occurred just two years after Rodgers' season-ending Achilles injury. Despite the quarterback's initial frustration, Jones humorously warned that he might tackle him again after a future touchdown. The incident has become a talking point ahead of the Steelers' upcoming game against Rodgers' former team, the Green Bay Packers.</p>

          <p>Recent research indicates a strong association between poor oral health and an increased risk of stroke and brain damage. One study found that adults with gum disease are more likely to show signs of damage to the brain's white matter, a condition linked to inflammation and the hardening of small blood vessels. A separate study revealed that having both gum disease and cavities is associated with an 86% higher risk of stroke. Conversely, maintaining good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and dental visits, was found to potentially lower stroke risk by as much as 81%.</p>

          <p>Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a U.S.-based ocean carrier, has been unexpectedly hit with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill due to last-minute changes in new port fees enacted by the Trump administration.

The company's CEO, Andrew Abbott, expressed shock and warned that the tariffs could force the company to cease U.S. operations, disrupting supply chains for American manufacturers.

A subsequent announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart further fueled the momentum, though the stock's gains later faded.

Ranching groups, including the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, strongly rebuked the plan, arguing it undercuts American producers and will not effectively lower grocery prices.

          <h2>Wholesale Turkey Prices Increase by 40% Ahead of Thanksgiving Holiday</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may face higher prices for Thanksgiving turkeys this year, as wholesale costs have surged by 40% compared to 2024, reaching an estimated $1.32 per pound. The price hike is primarily due to a shrinking supply, caused by a combination of slightly weaker long-term demand and recent avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million turkeys this year. In response, major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals on turkeys, often using them as loss leaders to attract holiday shoppers. Economists expect some retail price increases but believe they will be smaller than the wholesale surge.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed that U.S. forces conducted a strike on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board. This is the eighth such strike against alleged drug boats since early September but the first to occur in the Pacific. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was on a known trafficking route and that the administration is engaged in a "non-international armed conflict" with these organizations. The operation is part of a broader counter-narcotics effort involving thousands of U.S. troops in the region, which has so far resulted in at least 34 fatalities.</p>

          <h2>Economic Analysis Suggests Americans May Receive Larger Tax Refunds in 2026</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from Oxford Economics suggests that many American taxpayers could see larger tax refunds when they file in 2026 due to retroactive provisions in the Republicans' recent tax law. The law extended previous tax cuts and introduced new breaks, but since IRS withholding tables have not yet been updated, many employees are likely overpaying taxes this year. This overpayment could result in an estimated $50 billion in additional savings for taxpayers through bigger refunds or lower tax bills. The report notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits is expected to go to upper-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The director of the Louvre Museum, Laurence des Cars, has publicly admitted to significant security failings that led to the recent theft of €88 million worth of French crown jewels. Speaking to French senators, she revealed that the museum's perimeter CCTV system was weak and aging, with the only camera monitoring the relevant exterior wall pointing in the wrong direction. This failure allowed the thieves to approach undetected and access the Gallery of Apollo. Des Cars stated, "We failed these jewels," and acknowledged the urgent need to modernize the security infrastructure of the world's most visited museum.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is largely motivated by national political sentiment, particularly opposition to President Trump. Voters who view the measure through a national lens are overwhelmingly in favor, citing a desire to oppose the Trump administration, which they feel treats California unfairly. Conversely, opponents tend to focus on state-level concerns, such as a potential shift of power from rural to urban areas. The strong anti-Trump sentiment in the heavily Democratic state appears to be giving the "yes" campaign a significant advantage.</p>
