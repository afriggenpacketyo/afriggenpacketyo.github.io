          <p>An investigation reveals the largely unregulated and legal trade of human body parts in the United States, where for-profit companies known as "body brokers" acquire and sell donated corpses for medical research. The article highlights cases of exploitation and mishandling, such as families discovering their loved ones' bodies were dismembered disrespectfully, contrasting with the altruistic intentions of donors. While proponents argue these brokers fill a crucial gap for medical and scientific advancement, critics call for stricter regulations similar to those in Europe to prevent the commodification of human remains and protect grieving families from predatory practices.</p>

          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education suggest a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their attendance for the remainder of the term. The data shows that over half of pupils who were partially absent during the initial week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize full attendance from the start of the new term to combat the high absenteeism rates that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been contacted about the deployment and suggested President Trump has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. This follows the president's recent criticism of Chicago's crime rates and the deployment of federal agents to other major cities. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of crime in the city.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. Amid a dysfunctional international system often paralyzed by competing national interests, Indonesia's status as an economic powerhouse with ties to multiple ideological camps allows it to act as a bridge. The author argues that Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a corrective model for international relations. This approach prioritizes practical cooperation over ideological confrontation, potentially offering a new road map for a more functional world order.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The "Protecting Chicago Initiative" seeks to prevent federal forces from deputizing local police and sets rules requiring agents to be identifiable and not wear masks, except for health reasons. Johnson stated the order sends a clear message that the city will use all available legal tools to oppose federal actions that could violate constitutional rights. The move comes amid heightened tensions with the Trump administration over crime and immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a lifelong dream for the filmmaker.

Del Toro emphasized his desire to portray the creature with beauty and as a newborn, rather than a disfigured victim. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scale and artistry, while others found it lacked the necessary emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>A shooter opened fire through the windows of Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school Mass, killing two children, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski, and injuring 18 others. The 23-year-old suspect, identified as a former student of the attached school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities report the shooter was heavily armed and had legally purchased the weapons recently, with an investigation revealing an obsession with past mass shootings and a variety of hateful ideologies. The attack is being investigated as domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.</p>

          <h2>Federal Appeals Court Rules Most of Trump's "Reciprocal Tariffs" Are Illegal</h2>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on most countries, declaring the move illegal. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to implement such broad levies, a power that resides with Congress. The decision puts tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. imports on uncertain legal ground, though the duties will remain in effect until October 14 to allow for a potential Supreme Court appeal. However, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum were not affected by the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article synthesizes expert consensus on safe screen time limits for children, emphasizing that guidelines should align with developmental stages. Pediatricians and psychologists generally recommend a "screen-free until age three" approach to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. For older children, the focus shifts from a strict time limit to the quality of content and ensuring digital interaction does not replace essential real-world social skills, imagination, and physical activity. Parents are advised to engage with their children about their digital lives and establish clear rules for the whole family.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, pose a significant threat to the central bank's independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term economic consequences like higher inflation and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar.

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded Jack Grealish's performance after the player, on loan from Manchester City, delivered another man-of-the-match display in a 3-2 win at Wolves. Grealish, who has provided multiple assists in consecutive games, has quickly become a key player for Everton after spending much of last season on the bench at his parent club. Moyes described Grealish as "better than I thought" and a "maverick" who adds a creative edge to the team. The player's resurgence in form has raised questions about his potential return to the England national team squad.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy for his long-standing anti-vaccine advocacy and promotion of conspiracy theories, which he argues is undermining the nation's health infrastructure. The call for resignation follows recent turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of its director and subsequent resignations of other top officials.

However, councils like Epping Forest and West Northamptonshire state they will press on with their legal actions, citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns.

They successfully relocated salmon, trout, and other species to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the rescuers felt it was better than leaving them to die.</p>
