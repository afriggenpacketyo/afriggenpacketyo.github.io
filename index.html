        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 10,000 Ford workers in Cologne, Germany, initiated their first official strike in the plant's century-long history due to concerns about potential job losses. The company plans to cut 2,900 jobs at the Cologne factory, which has been a source of employment for multiple generations of families. Industry experts suggest that Ford's European business faces a bleak future due to its relatively small size in the passenger vehicle sector and struggles with the transition to electromobility. The strike aimed to secure fair compensation and transfer measures for employees, reflecting broader anxieties within the automotive sector due to economic downturns and international trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, underwent an MRI that revealed a second tumor on her spine. Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center successfully removed the spinal tumor through her eye in a first-of-its-kind surgery. The complex procedure, developed by Dr. Mohamed Labib, involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. Flores has since undergone radiation treatment and is now cancer-free, with doctors hoping the procedure can be used to help others with difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

          <p>Promising mRNA HIV-vaccine candidates have encountered a setback due to participants developing rashes and chronic hives in clinical trials. These skin reactions, while treatable, have slowed down research as scientists seek to understand the cause. The situation is complicated by the current administration's anti-vaccine stances and funding cuts for HIV and vaccine research. The detected rashes represent a scientific setback in a high-profile mRNA vaccine trial, potentially upending progress toward ending the HIV pandemic.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing migrants are appealing to stop President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, for deportations. The move is seen as the opening salvo in a significant legal battle over the president's deportation policies. The ACLU and other groups are arguing that the act is being improperly applied to migrants, particularly Venezuelans, as part of an aggressive deportation agenda. The case will likely determine the extent to which the wartime law can be used in immigration enforcement.</p>

Stylists are seeing fewer clients as prices rise, and some may have to increase their prices.
