          <p>A federal judge ruled that Apple must ease its grip on the App Store, preventing them from collecting commissions on some app sales and restricting developers' payment options. Judge Gonzalez Rogers criticized Apple for defying a previous ruling and accused CEO Tim Cook and other executives of lying. The judge ordered Apple to allow apps to provide external links for direct payments, cease commissions on outside sales, and refrain from discouraging users from making purchases outside the App Store. The ruling is a major win for Epic Games, potentially reshaping the app economy by increasing developer revenue and reducing Apple's fees. Apple plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Apple has been referred for a possible criminal contempt investigation after a US district judge found the company willfully violated an injunction in a case brought by Epic Games. The judge stated that a top Apple executive "outright lied" under oath regarding the company's attempts to circumvent the court's order to allow third-party payment options in the App Store. Apple allegedly imposed a 27% commission on off-app purchases and created barriers to discourage customers from using competing platforms. In response, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney proposed a peace deal, offering to return Fortnite to the App Store if Apple extends the court's ruling worldwide.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement to create a "reconstruction investment" fund, granting Washington privileged access to Ukrainian mineral resources, which are crucial for high-tech industries.

          <p>President Donald Trump requested more time to address the US economy's recent contraction, which saw a 0.3% annual decrease, marking the first downturn in three years.

The contraction follows Trump's implementation of import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets. Despite the downturn, Trump highlighted planned investments in technology, healthcare, and infrastructure, urging Congress to pass his tax bill. </p>

Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument, while liberal justices expressed concerns about weakening the separation between church and state.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at LAX discovered 17.41 pounds of liquid methamphetamine concealed in plastic bottles labeled as dog shampoo in an air cargo shipment destined for Australia. The estimated street value of the recovered drugs is more than $1.8 million. The drugs were found during an inspection of an outbound air cargo shipment declared as “Assorted Dog Shampoos.” Since October 2023, officers have seized more than 174,000 pounds of meth coming into the country or being sent abroad.</p>

          <h2>NYC Rent Guidelines Board Backs Rent Increases for Stabilized Apartments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of higher rents for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The preliminary vote backed increases of between 1.75 and 4.75 percent on one-year leases and between 4.75 and 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates expressed concern that the increases would exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords argued that the increases were insufficient. The decision reflects the priorities of Mayor Eric Adams, who has been more supportive of landlords than his predecessor.</p>

          <p>President Trump insisted that a man his administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador had gang tattoos on his hand, despite evidence the photograph he displayed was altered to include the alphanumeric term “MS13.” During an interview, Trump refused to acknowledge that the characters had been photoshopped onto the picture, maintaining the man had the tattoos. The White House declined to explain why Trump did not realize the photograph had been altered. The administration has faced increasing scrutiny over its handling of the case and has responded by releasing statements and photographs to paint the deported man as a criminal.</p>

          <p>Visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon reflected on the war's lasting impact, expressing a mix of sadness, fury, and closure.

Some veterans shared that their anger and frustration had diminished over time, while others maintained strong opinions about the war's significance.

Investigators are trying to pinpoint the exact point of origin and how the fire spread during a windstorm. Officials are exploring whether an earlier fire sparked by fireworks had reignited.

          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed due to Republican opposition, highlighting anxieties over potential economic disruptions. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote came after Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on most U.S. trading partners and increased levies on others. Some senators expressed concern about the tariffs' impact on small businesses. House Republican leadership has also taken steps to prevent votes to block the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas hospitality workers are still waiting for President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, with no legislation yet enacted 100 days into his second term.

Union leaders are calling for action, not just promises, on this issue. Two bills are under consideration, one in the Senate to eliminate federal income tax on tips, and another in the House to also replace the sub-minimum wage.</p>

          <p>The report that the economy contracted in the first quarter highlighted how much President Trump has at risk as he pursues an aggressive trade war. The contraction came after a campaign in which voters bought his argument that he could skillfully manage the economy. If the report proves to be a harbinger of an extended slowdown or recession, the situation could become the economic analog of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s fumbled withdrawal from Afghanistan four years ago this summer. The president's bet is that Mr. Xi will blink first because the pain for the Chinese economy will be so great that he will have to strike an accommodation that will, over time, allow the United States to get back to something approaching normal. </p>
