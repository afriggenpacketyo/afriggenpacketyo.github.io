          <h2>Trump Expresses Displeasure Over Apple's Production Expansion in India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 05:38:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump voiced his disapproval to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India, emphasizing his preference for Apple to manufacture its products in the United States. Trump referenced Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the U.S. and urged Cook to prioritize domestic production over international expansion, particularly in India. Apple has been gradually shifting its production focus to India, aiming to manufacture approximately 25% of its global iPhones there in the coming years, in an effort to reduce its reliance on China. Trump insisted that the U.S. has been accommodating to Apple's manufacturing in China for years and now expects the company to build in America.</p>

          <p>Hopes for direct peace negotiations between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul diminished as both Putin and former U.S. President Donald Trump decided not to attend. Zelenskyy had conditioned his participation on Putin's presence, while Trump had urged Ukraine to engage in immediate discussions with Russia to explore potential deals. Despite Putin's absence, Russia sent a delegation led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, and the U.S. sent envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The situation leaves Zelenskyy's attendance uncertain, though he is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Erdogan in Ankara.</p>

          <p>Overnight airstrikes on Khan Younis, a southern city in Gaza, have resulted in the deaths of dozens, according to reports from a local hospital. These strikes occurred as former U.S. President Donald Trump visited the Middle East, raising hopes for a potential ceasefire or increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for three months. Among the deceased was a journalist from Al Araby TV, along with eleven members of his family. This incident marks the second consecutive night of intense bombing, with previous strikes killing at least 70 people, including many children, indicating an escalation of the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves indicated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" following a stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year. The growth was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, though analysts cautioned that the positive trend may not persist due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite the promising figures, Reeves acknowledged that many families still face a cost of living crisis, and opposition figures criticized the government's economic policies. Annabel Thomas, chief executive of Nc'nean Whisky Distillery, expressed confidence in the UK's prospects, while John Inglis of Exactaform voiced concerns about the impact of tariffs and taxes on business decisions.</p>

          <p>A Texas mother, Ashley Pardo, was arrested for allegedly purchasing ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who was planning a "mass targeted violence" event at a San Antonio school. School staff discovered a map labeled "suicide route" drawn by the son, indicating his intentions. The boy had also researched past mass shooters and attempted suicide after being suspended for researching a massacre at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, certain everyday items like coffee and beef are experiencing rapid price increases. Coffee prices have surged due to droughts in major producing regions like Vietnam and Brazil, restricting global output. Beef prices are also climbing due to a supply shortage stemming from drought conditions that forced ranchers to reduce their herds. Additionally, car repair costs are up due to the increasing complexity of vehicle technology and a shortage of skilled technicians, while men's and women's outerwear prices have risen despite overall apparel prices dropping slightly, likely driven by consumer trends and specialty brands.</p>

          <p>The New York Times delves into the formula for winning the Eurovision Song Contest, analyzing past winners to identify key trends. The article suggests singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, and incorporating elements of folk music, but warns against dramatic key changes and overly silly staging. Successful acts often feature elaborate performances with fire or pyrotechnics, but should avoid being perceived as mere novelty acts. The article points out that the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the contest, aims to maintain a neutral, apolitical environment, but the event often reflects underlying political tensions.</p>

The conversation covers the potential for economic disruption, the risk of AI misalignment with human goals, and the geopolitical implications of an AI arms race between the US and China.

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Arguments on Trump's Efforts to End Birthright Citizenship</h2>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding former President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants. The case focuses on whether lower court judges have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential orders, with the Trump administration arguing that these injunctions undermine the president's ability to carry out his policy agenda. Legal experts contend that the president lacks the power to end birthright citizenship, as it is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, but the Supreme Court's decision could impact Trump's ability to implement executive orders with limited judicial oversight.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose, 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson, and others to Hall of Fame eligibility, a decision influenced by a petition filed by Rose's representatives and a meeting between Manfred and former President Donald Trump. The move, which acknowledges that deceased players no longer pose a threat to the game's integrity, highlights the complex relationship between baseball and gambling, particularly in light of MLB's partnerships with sports betting companies. While some view the decision as a chance for Rose to be recognized for his achievements, others argue that it undermines the sport's integrity and moral standards, especially given the league's continued crackdown on gambling among its employees.</p>

          <p>A Texas senator, Bryan Hughes, is spearheading efforts to clarify the state's abortion ban by introducing a new law that aims to provide a clearer pathway for doctors to perform the procedure when a mother's life is at risk. The move comes as Texas has seen a significant increase in maternal deaths since the implementation of a near-total abortion ban in 2021. While the bill has garnered bipartisan support, some medical professionals and abortion rights advocates remain skeptical, arguing that the proposed law may not offer sufficient clarity or protection for doctors and pregnant women facing life-threatening situations.</p>

          <p>Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located off the coast of Oregon, is anticipated to erupt for the first time in 11 years, potentially stirring up significant activity for marine life. The volcano's eruptions create hydrothermal vents, which are rich in warmth and nutrients, supporting unique ecosystems. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans due to the volcano's depth and distance from shore, scientists anticipate small earthquakes and changes in the chemical composition of the surrounding waters. The Ocean Observatories Initiative is helping researchers monitor these changes and improve underwater volcano forecasting.</p>

The lobbying effort follows a legal challenge to Trump's attempt to fire CPB board members, with a federal judge questioning the administration's authority.
