        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly terminated all trade discussions with Canada, citing Ottawa's implementation of a digital services tax that impacts major American technology companies. President Trump characterized the tax as a "blatant attack" and announced that new tariffs against Canada would be revealed within a week. This move immediately jeopardized the extensive trade relationship, valued at over $762 billion last year, and caused a downturn in stock markets upon the announcement. The Canadian tax, which applies retroactively, is set to begin collections shortly.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has emerged as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, fueled by its recent inclusion in the index and positive regulatory news like the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. Analysts suggest the stock's rally is also linked to the strong market performance of its partner, Circle, and the expansion of its product offerings, including a crypto-backed credit card.

Recent data showed inflation remaining near its lowest level since 2021, and a trade agreement with China has helped soften forecasts of a potential downturn.

The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, requiring the school to allow opt-outs while the case proceeds.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a practice frequently used to block executive branch policies. The decision stemmed from a case involving President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, with the court stating that such universal orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Price Spikes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant increase in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these strategies have buffered the initial shock, experts caution that prices are still likely to rise in the latter half of the year as the full impact of the tariffs is felt throughout the supply chain.

          <p>In the closing arguments of his racketeering and sex trafficking trial, Sean "Diddy" Combs's lawyer portrayed the music mogul as the target of a flawed prosecution. The defense attorney argued that the government exaggerated evidence, attempting to criminalize a swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use to fit a racketeering conspiracy charge. He called the prosecution a "fake trial" and asserted that no witness had testified to being part of a criminal enterprise. Prosecutors had previously argued that Combs used his power and influence to facilitate and cover up numerous serious crimes.</p>

Earlier in the week, Mexico's banking regulator stepped in to temporarily manage CIBanco and two other financial institutions also named in the sanctions. The trusts are taking precautionary measures to mitigate risks from the intervention, with Fibra Inn stating CIBanco will continue its duties until a replacement is appointed.</p>

His platform, which includes higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, has caused alarm among some business leaders and conservative commentators.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision allowing parents to opt children out of instruction with LGBTQ-themed books is being analyzed as a move that could effectively create a nationwide "Don't Say Gay" policy. This article argues that the ruling imposes a significant administrative burden on schools, which may now feel compelled to avoid any materials featuring queer characters to prevent potential lawsuits. Critics suggest that because the ruling is broad, schools will likely err on the side of caution, leading to the exclusion of diverse stories and placing religious conservative viewpoints above LGBTQ+ representation in classrooms.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, who qualified for the Wimbledon main draw, has highlighted a restrictive NCAA rule that prevents him from claiming his full prize money. As a student-athlete at the University of San Diego, Tarvet is limited to profiting $10,000 per year from professional tournaments, plus expenses, meaning he cannot keep the full Â£66,000 earned from his Wimbledon appearance. Tarvet expressed his belief that he deserves the money he worked hard to earn and called for a change in the NCAA regulations. This issue has been the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed by other college players.</p>

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," marks a return to the electronic, rhythm-driven sound of her earlier work while exploring themes of desire, confusion, and a shattering breakup. Set against the backdrop of downtown Manhattan, the album attempts to capture a visceral, physical energy but is sometimes diluted by a pervasive self-consciousness. This article's review suggests that while Lorde remains a pivotal voice in pop, the album's focus on granular self-inspection reflects a broader cultural trend where introspection can overshadow a sense of shared experience. The production is noted for being less radical than it presents itself.</p>

          <p>A legal contributor argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a tragic and grievous blow to the separation of powers. The ruling, which prevents federal courts from halting unconstitutional executive actions across the country, is seen as radically curtailing judicial power. This article contends that the decision will make it far more difficult to challenge unlawful policies, potentially requiring separate lawsuits in all 94 federal districts to stop a single action. The author echoes the dissents of Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, calling the holding a grave attack on the legal system.</p>

Following classified briefings, some Democrats have cast doubt on the administration's claims about the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program. The resolution faces a difficult path to passage in the Republican-controlled Senate, but highlights the ongoing constitutional debate over war powers.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the political implications of the Islamophobic attacks against New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani by prominent Republican figures. It argues that while Mamdani's progressive platform offers many points for legitimate criticism, the choice to focus on his Muslim faith is revealing. The author suggests this rhetoric is counterproductive for the Republican party, which saw increased support from minority voters, including Muslims, in the last election. Instead of building on this coalition, the MAGA movement's xenophobic response risks alienating the very voters it recently gained.</p>

The initial plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) faced a large backbench rebellion, forcing the government to apply the stricter criteria only to new claimants. Additionally, ministers reversed a planned freeze on the health component of Universal Credit for existing recipients.
