          <p>Nvidia announced earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' estimates, driven by a significant 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business, which includes AI chips. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance is tempered by reduced sales due to export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips. Despite political tensions, Nvidia's growth is fueled by the robust demand for its AI chips, crucial for applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. The gaming division also saw substantial growth, highlighting Nvidia's continued importance in both the gaming and AI sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 for leading a criminal enterprise while incarcerated in Illinois, adding to his existing 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder. It remains unclear when Hoover will be released from federal custody, as he still faces the remainder of his state sentence in Illinois.</p>
