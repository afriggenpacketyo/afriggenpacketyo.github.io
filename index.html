          <p>Iran's UN ambassador, Ali Bahreini, has stated that Iran will respond strongly to Israel's aggression and any US involvement, emphasizing the country's right to defend its people and territory. Bahreini accused the US of complicity in Israel's actions and warned against targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, calling it a war against humanity, although Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. This statement comes as strikes between Israel and Iran continue, causing widespread displacement in major Iranian cities, with the US President calling for Tehran's unconditional surrender. The escalating conflict raises concerns about regional stability and potential international involvement, and the rhetoric from both sides indicates a dangerous escalation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota legislator, and her husband were murdered in a politically motivated shooting.

          <p>China's state media, People's Daily, has cautioned against the overzealous implementation of the ongoing austerity campaign at local levels. While curbing corruption and extravagance is necessary, the commentary argues that it should not come at the expense of citizens' daily lives or local economies. The article highlights instances where localities have imposed excessive restrictions, equating "prohibiting illegal dining and drinking" with a complete ban on all eating and drinking, causing businesses to lose customers and diminishing vibrancy. This critique suggests a need for a more balanced approach to the austerity measures, considering the potential negative impacts on both businesses and the public.</p>

          <p>Democrat Abigail Spanberger is focusing on her life and career in her campaign for Virginia governor, highlighting her experiences as a CIA case officer and a bipartisan-minded U.S. House representative. Her campaign's new advertisement showcases her journey through various hallways, from her high school to the Capitol, emphasizing her commitment to lowering costs and improving education. As Virginia's gubernatorial races are often seen as political bellwethers, strategists from both parties view this year's outcome as a test of the national mood and messaging on key issues. The election will also make history, as either Spanberger or her Republican opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, will become the Commonwealth's first female governor.</p>

          <p>Excavation has begun at the site of a former Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Ireland, where authorities believe the remains of approximately 800 infants and young children are buried. The home, run by Catholic nuns, was one of many such institutions that housed unmarried pregnant women and orphans during the 20th century. Historian Catherine Corless tracked down death certificates for nearly 800 children who died at the home but found only one burial record, leading to the discovery of a mass grave in an underground sewage structure. The excavation process is expected to take two years, with recovered remains being analyzed and either returned to family members or reburied, and this grim task brings closure to a tragic chapter in Irish history.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's enforcement of an executive order that directed the US government to officially recognize genders as only male and female, ordering the State Department to continue issuing passports with "X" as a gender designation. The ruling states that the State Department's passport policy likely violates the constitutional rights of thousands of Americans by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of six transgender people, and the judge issued a preliminary injunction against the policy, allowing the plaintiffs to obtain passports consistent with their gender identity. The Trump administration maintains that the policy does not violate equal protection guarantees, but the White House claimed the ruling was an attempt to thwart President Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion in Europe and foster political integration on the continent. The organization, now with 31 members, operates as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense if a member state is threatened by an external country, as outlined in Article 5 of its charter. Russia's war against Ukraine has renewed NATO's sense of purpose, with the alliance's open-door policy allowing any European country that can contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to join.

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against major oil companies, including BP and Shell, alleging that they contributed to the extreme heatwave in Seattle in 2021, which led to the death of Juliana Leon. The suit claims that these companies knew for decades that their fossil fuel products were altering the earth's atmosphere and willfully created a fossil fuel-dependent economy, resulting in foreseeable loss of human life. This is the first wrongful death claim of its kind, and a win for the plaintiff could set a precedent for individuals to seek damages from fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change.

          <p>As Senate Republicans work to pass a spending bill, key provisions, including the child tax credit, could be altered through negotiations between the Senate and House. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act temporarily increased the maximum child tax credit to $2,000, set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and indexing it for inflation, while the House bill suggests a $2,500 credit from 2025 through 2028, which would then drop to $2,000. Some policy experts note that neither version would benefit the lowest-earning families, as the increase would primarily go to middle and upper-income families.</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in UK waters as species shift habitats in response to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, with many finding new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas to ensure continued species protection amid changing habitats, but it's important to protect species from fishing equipment, disease, or pollution.</p>

          <p>Dozens of lesser-known Chinese firms from across the aviation supply chain have flocked to the Paris Air Show to showcase their products to Western buyers, marking a significant increase in China's presence. The number of Chinese companies attending the show has more than doubled since 2023, driven by plateauing domestic profits and intense competition at home. These companies are vying for a place in the European market as they seek to expand their reach and diversify their customer base. This increased participation reflects China's growing ambition and capabilities in the global aerospace industry.</p>

          <h2>US Drug Overdose Deaths Show Increase After Period of Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the CDC indicates that drug overdose deaths in the U.S. have risen again after a period of decline, with preliminary data showing an increase of roughly 1,400 deaths over the previous 12-month period. While the overall number remains below the peak recorded in August 2023, the increase has prompted concern among addiction researchers, who suggest that the factors driving recent declines may be fading. Most overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl, often mixed with other dangerous substances, and experts emphasize the need for continued public health investments to address the crisis. Some worry that potential cuts to Medicaid and addiction-related programs could hinder efforts to curb overdose deaths.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady as policymakers assess the impact of President Trump's tariffs and international tensions on the US economy. Despite pressure from President Trump to cut rates, the Fed has maintained a cautious approach, citing increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. While inflation has remained relatively tame, concerns persist that tariffs and rising oil prices could reignite price pressures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Trump administration's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) agenda, which emphasizes reducing exposure to toxic chemicals, its actions have contradicted these goals. The administration has cut funding for research on environmental health, weakened regulations on pollution, and appointed individuals with conflicts of interest to key positions at the EPA. This disconnect between rhetoric and action has frustrated scientists and advocates who have long warned of the harmful effects of toxic chemicals, particularly on children, and have called for greater government oversight of the chemical industry. The actions are viewed as undermining the very agencies and scientific community needed to protect children against these hazards.</p>

          <p>Chocolate prices in the UK have risen at the fastest pace on record, contributing to overall food cost increases, according to official figures. The main rate of inflation remained at 3.4% in May, while food prices grew for the third consecutive month, with some economists suggesting businesses are passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to consumers. Chocolate prices have been particularly affected by bad harvests in cocoa-producing regions, leading to a 17.7% increase in the year to May. The rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, but the overall pace of price rises remains a concern for families.</p>
