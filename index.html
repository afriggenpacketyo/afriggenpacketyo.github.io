          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter passed away at 85 in New Hampshire. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with liberal justices, frustrating Bush and other Republicans. A notable example was in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where he upheld the right to abortion, a decision later undone by the Supreme Court in 2022. After retiring in 2009, Souter continued to serve as a judge on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit for over a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR article explores the cultural and political reasons behind Americans' longing for the return of factory jobs. Despite nostalgia for the past, manufacturing jobs are now in the bottom half of all salaries, and automation has reduced the need for human labor. The article suggests that narratives about factory work align with conservative views around traditional families and national security concerns. Ultimately, the article argues that other jobs should also have the 'good job' status, and politicians should stand up for Amazon warehouse workers, for instance.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports on a dispute among board members of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum after President Trump fired several Biden appointees. Kevin Abel, a Biden appointee, wrote a letter criticizing the museum's silence on the firings, invoking the Holocaust and urging the museum to speak out against the 'campaign of retribution'. This sparked heated email exchanges among board members, with some defending Trump's actions and others expressing disappointment in the museum's silence. The exchange prompted Stuart E.

These Republicans, representing high-cost-of-living areas, are pushing to raise the cap on SALT deductions, but House leaders have rejected their demands. While some Republicans are open to a compromise, others argue that raising the deduction would unfairly subsidize residents of poorly managed states. The issue is critical for vulnerable lawmakers in the House GOP Conference, whose seats are key to maintaining a Republican majority.</p>

          <p>David Steiner, a FedEx board member and former CEO of Waste Management Inc., has been selected as the next USPS postmaster general. The announcement has drawn immediate concerns from postal unions, who fear possible privatization efforts. Unions view Steiner's selection as a conflict of interest and a step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests. Steiner stated that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and believes in maintaining its independence.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's president expressed disappointment after talks with the U.S. Treasury Secretary failed to ease tariffs on Swiss goods. However, she expressed hope for a resolution to U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva, suggesting that the 'Holy Spirit' might guide the discussions. Going into the talks, the U.S. has imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Trump floated the prospect that those could be lowered sharply.</p>

          <p>Wildland firefighting crews are facing staffing shortages due to Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers. Forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon express concern over a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces a significant wildfire season. Despite claims that funding is not in jeopardy, officials report that experienced, trained workers have been let go. The loss of these workers, who provide essential frontline support, could hinder firefighting efforts.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is warning the public about the harmful effects of products containing tianeptine, also known as 'gas station heroin.' Tianeptine, an opioid alternative prescribed as an antidepressant in some countries, is not approved by the FDA for any use in the U.S. and can cause serious harm, including death. Symptoms include agitation, confusion, sweating, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and coma. The FDA has previously warned against products containing tianeptine and recalled Neptune's Fix products due to their use of the substance.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights the right wing's strategy to restrict access to abortion pills. Anti-abortion activists are pressuring the FDA to reimpose restrictions on mifepristone, bringing lawsuits against doctors who prescribe abortion medication, and lobbying to ban the drug entirely. The vision relies heavily on a report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, contradicting decades of safety testing. While activists' current focus is on telehealth bans and physician intimidation, anti-abortion leaders are pushing to ban the drug entirely.</p>

          <p>A CNBC article discusses a striking trend in the apartment rental market: low turnover. Typically, about half of apartment renters in large urban markets move when their leases expire, but that is not happening now. The low turnover is attributed to factors such as an unaffordable for-sale market, lack of rental supply on the coasts, economic uncertainty, the cost of moving, and a shift to suburban apartments. As a result, landlords are getting better pricing from renewals and improving cash flow.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article examines the potential impact of President Trump's budget bill on Medicaid spending, noting that it may require particularly painful cuts in the South. Republicans are struggling to find major Medicaid cuts, and the remaining option, limiting how states use a tax loophole, would disproportionately hurt poorer, Southern states. This could force these states to drop coverage for lower-income adults or cut hospital payments. The final package likely needs one of the two big cuts to achieve Republicansâ€™ budget goals.</p>
