          <p>Former President Donald Trump has departed Scotland following a four-day visit that included a meeting with First Minister John Swinney. The two leaders discussed the potential for reducing U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, with Swinney urging Trump to use his influence to secure a ceasefire. Trump also commented on North Sea oil and gas taxation, aligning with Swinney's view that the industry is overtaxed. The visit combined political discussions with the opening of a new golf course at Trump's Aberdeenshire resort, where he was gifted historical documents related to his Scottish mother.</p>

          <p>Kering, the parent company of Gucci, reported a significant 15% drop in second-quarter sales, falling short of analyst expectations amid struggles in key markets like China and the United States. The company's flagship brand, Gucci, experienced a dramatic 25% plunge in sales, highlighting persistent challenges for the luxury giant. Chairman François-Henri Pinault acknowledged the disappointing results but expressed confidence in the company's long-term turnaround strategy. Kering faces ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and pressure to revive its brands' desirability in a competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was targeting the NFL headquarters, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, left a note indicating he believed he had the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. Tamura, who never played professionally, mistakenly took an elevator to a different office, where he carried out the attack before taking his own life. The victims included an NYPD officer, a Blackstone employee, and a security officer, prompting widespread grief and calls for increased security.</p>

          <p>Republican Senate candidate Mike Rogers states that an endorsement from former President Donald Trump provides a significant boost to his campaign to flip a key Democrat-held seat in Michigan. The endorsement helped clear the primary field for Rogers, who is making his second consecutive run for the Senate after a narrow loss in the previous election. Rogers noted that Trump's backing has already unified the state's Republican party and spurred an increase in fundraising efforts. He believes this early momentum gives him a strong advantage as he prepares for the 2026 midterm election.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 has plummeted from 55% at his inauguration to 28%, according to a CBS News analysis. This decline, more than double that of any other age group, is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged individuals. The shift appears linked to economic dissatisfaction, with a majority of young people now feeling his policies are making them financially worse off and that he is not focused enough on lowering prices. This trend reverses the gains Trump made with young voters in the 2024 election. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the United Nations reports catastrophic hunger in Gaza, with dozens of recent deaths from malnutrition, medical experts are detailing the devastating effects of starvation on the human body. The process unfolds in five phases, beginning with the body using its carbohydrate stores before turning to fat and, finally, its own muscle protein for energy. This final stage leads to severe muscle wasting, organ failure, and a weakened immune system, often resulting in death from infection or cardiac arrest. Children and pregnant people are especially vulnerable, facing long-term developmental and health consequences even if they survive.</p>

This 'endangerment finding' serves as the legal foundation for most federal climate regulations under the Clean Air Act, including limits on emissions from vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin framed the move as a major deregulatory action intended to boost the economy. Critics, including former EPA leaders and environmental groups, warn that repealing the finding would be a dangerous breach of the agency's mission and would dismantle vital protections against climate change.</p>

          <p>Just one week after turning professional, 21-year-old British golfer Lottie Woad is the betting favorite to win the AIG Women's Open, the final major of the year. Her startling rise comes after winning the Scottish Open in her professional debut, following a successful amateur career that included an Irish Open victory. Woad's maturity and composure on the course have impressed fellow competitors, including world number one Nelly Korda. Despite the immense pressure and attention, Woad appears unfazed as she prepares to compete at Royal Porthcawl in Wales.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk plunged 23% after the company drastically cut its full-year sales and profit growth forecasts. The maker of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy cited weaker U.S. sales expectations due to competition and a slower-than-expected market expansion. Simultaneously, the company announced that veteran executive Maziar Mike Doustdar will take over as the new CEO. The dual announcements shocked investors, compounding negative sentiment that has followed a series of disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate.

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to streamline national deliveries by connecting Union Pacific's extensive western network with Norfolk Southern's network across 22 eastern states. While the railroads argue this will improve efficiency and delivery times, the deal will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about competition and the potential for service disruptions. If approved, the move could trigger further consolidation among the remaining major North American railroads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eloghosa Osunde’s new novel, 'Necessary Fiction,' is reviewed as a powerful exploration of kinship and community among queer Nigerians who form their own support systems. The article highlights how the book depicts family not as a biological obligation but as a deliberate and sustained act of love, a concept particularly relevant in a world of increasing atomization. By focusing on the deep, restorative bonds of 'chosen family,' the novel offers a compelling vision for how meaningful connections can be forged. It is presented as a singular work within a growing body of LGBTQ literature from Africa.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and a surge in U.S. imports as firms rushed to beat new taxes. The IMF now predicts 3% global growth in 2025, up from its April forecast of 2.8%, though this is still below pre-pandemic averages. The organization warned that this boost from 'front-loading' trade is temporary and that higher tariffs and ongoing uncertainty could still weaken the economy.

Copper is essential for green technology and modern infrastructure, and global demand is soaring. Critics of the policy, however, argue that the tariffs are inflationary and will lead to higher prices for American consumers and potential delays in construction projects.
