          <p>Analysts are debating the diplomatic implications of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi potentially attending China's 80th anniversary WWII victory parade. Some experts suggest his presence, alongside Russia, could provide a valuable opportunity to resolve ongoing Sino-Indian border disputes. However, despite a recent thaw in relations between the two nations, most observers believe it is unlikely that Modi will ultimately attend the event in Beijing. The situation highlights the delicate and complex political calculations involved in the region's diplomacy.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed retrospective on serial killer David Berkowitz, who terrorized New York City in the 1970s, based on a major television interview. Berkowitz discusses his life before the murders, the motivations he claims drove him to kill, and his current life in prison where he is serving six consecutive life sentences. He expresses remorse for his actions, which killed six people and wounded seven others, attributing his crimes to demonic influence while reflecting on his transformation into a born-again Christian in prison.</p>

          <p>A minor, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing brief shaking in the region, including parts of New York City. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. An analyst noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered significant and is not expected to cause damage. This event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the area in April 2024.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. The probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump were intended to harm his 2024 election prospects. This investigation by the independent OSC is a non-criminal inquiry focused on whether Smith's prosecutorial actions constituted improper political activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a new electronic warfare capability using a drone swarm to create an electromagnetic "storm eye." This technology allows for targeted jamming of enemy signals while simultaneously creating a protective bubble around friendly forces where interference is cancelled out. By precisely adjusting signal waveforms, the drones can safeguard allied communications from the disruptive effects of their own jamming activities. This marks a significant advancement over traditional, indiscriminate electronic warfare tactics.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for him to quit his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a physician, felt unsuited for medicine and was deeply affected by his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement. He recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking bad news to patients and realized he needed a change. The experience set him free to pursue a career in entertainment, leading to his success with shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 19:01:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite the player's public desire to remain at the club. This development comes as United continues to show interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club states it can make a new signing without first selling players, an acquisition like Sesko would marginalize Hojlund and necessitate exits to comply with financial sustainability rules. Selling Hojlund at this price would represent a book loss for the club on their initial investment.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it may become more cautious with its open-source approach in the future. This shift contrasts sharply with China's strategy, where a competitive open-source ecosystem is rapidly advancing AI development, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently releasing powerful new models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's vibrant, 'Darwinian' open-source environment could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during WWII, and his death was rumored to be caused by shell-shock from a Nazi U-boat encounter. However, newly digitized records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal the animal was likely killed by extreme heat as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding safe levels for the species, alongside dwindling food rations.</p>
