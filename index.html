          <p>The House Oversight Committee has released 33,295 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, which were provided by the Department of Justice. While the committee chair presented the release as a move towards transparency, Democratic members pointed out that the vast majority of the files were already in the public domain. A small portion of newly disclosed information includes logs of flight locations for Epstein's plane from 2000 to 2014. The document release occurred after the committee met with some of Epstein's victims amid ongoing public pressure.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B, whose legal name is Belcalis Almánzar, in a $24 million lawsuit filed by a security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, had accused the rapper of assault and battery during a 2018 confrontation at a Beverly Hills medical building. Ellis alleged the incident left her with physical and emotional scars, but Cardi B contended that the guard had been filming her and invading her privacy while she was pregnant. The jury ultimately sided with the rapper, who will not have to pay any damages.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that the U.S. Navy conducted a strike on a vessel in the southern Caribbean, alleging it was transporting a significant drug shipment from Venezuela. The administration later stated that the operation resulted in the deaths of 11 individuals identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. This action takes place amid escalating tensions, as the U.S. recently deployed warships to the region, prompting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to declare a state of "maximum preparedness" against what he views as American aggression.</p>

          <p>Following a market decline where the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all fell, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain faith in the companies they believe in for long-term gains. He attributed the drop to seasonal profit-taking in September and investor concerns over a recent court ruling on tariffs and the upcoming labor report. Cramer suggested holding onto strong Big Tech stocks, as he believes they can weather unfavorable conditions and typically rebound from such garden-variety pullbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales signals a significant shift in the party's direction with his brash and blunt political style. This development poses a new challenge for the UK's Labour Party, which is already facing pressure from other left-leaning and independent political figures. The article questions whether Polanski's more radical approach could alienate moderate voters in rural conservative areas where the Greens recently gained ground. It also explores the potential for either collaboration or conflict with other emerging left-wing movements.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Woody Allen described President Trump as "polite" and "very good" as an actor during an appearance on Bill Maher's "Club Random" podcast, recalling Trump's cameo in his 1998 film "Celebrity." Allen clarified that he disagrees with nearly all of Trump's political policies and voted for Kamala Harris, but his positive remarks about Trump's professionalism were highlighted by the president on social media. The commentary piece criticizes both Allen and Maher for normalizing a president whose administration is engaged in highly controversial actions, drawing parallels to past critiques of Maher's own interactions with Trump.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently claimed he ended six or seven wars and deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, but a review of the conflicts cited reveals a more complex reality. The White House list includes tensions between Israel and Iran, Rwanda and DRC, and India and Pakistan, among others. Foreign policy experts note that while the administration helped broker some ceasefires and agreements, several of these situations were not full-scale wars, and many of the underlying disputes remain unresolved. The analysis suggests that declaring these conflicts as settled is premature.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged over 8% after a federal judge issued remedies in its landmark antitrust case that were less severe than investors had feared. While finding Google holds an illegal monopoly in search, Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Department of Justice's demand to force a sale of the Chrome browser. Instead, the ruling bars Google from entering exclusive default search engine contracts and requires it to share some search data with rivals. The decision was seen as a significant win for the company, avoiding a disruptive breakup of its core assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged a tow truck driver with theft of government property after he allegedly drove off with a federal agent's vehicle in Los Angeles. The incident occurred as agents were arresting TikTok influencer Tatiana Mafla-Martinez, who is suspected of being in the country illegally. Authorities claim the driver, Bobby Nunez, interfered with the arrest and then towed the agent's car, which contained a firearm in a safe. The influencer's arrest, which she was livestreaming, also drew criticism from witnesses for the agents' aggressive tactics.</p>

          <p>In a major antitrust ruling, a U.S. District Judge has ordered Google to implement significant changes to its business practices but stopped short of the Justice Department's request to break up the company. The decision requires Google to end exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices and to share some search data with competitors. However, the judge rejected the forced sale of the popular Chrome browser, concluding that such a drastic measure was not justified by the company's illegal conduct. The ruling aims to restore competition in the online search market.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted a hold on a contract allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use Graphite, a sophisticated spyware from Israeli-founded company Paragon. This powerful tool can reportedly hack into any mobile phone, including accessing data from encrypted applications like WhatsApp and Signal. Civil liberties advocates and security experts have expressed alarm over the move, citing the profound threat to privacy, free speech, and the potential for abuse by a domestic law enforcement agency. The decision raises significant counterintelligence and human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have co-authored an open letter accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of endangering American health. They criticize his policies, which include restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and firing thousands of healthcare workers, as unprecedented and alarming. The letter also highlights the recent removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez as a damaging blow to the agency. Kennedy has defended his actions, stating the CDC needs reform due to what he calls "politicized science and mission creep."</p>
