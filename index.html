          <p>Intel's stock saw its best day since October 1987, surging nearly 23% after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment into the company. The strategic partnership aims to co-develop data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI computing stack with Intel's x86 CPUs. This collaboration follows recent major investments from both SoftBank and the U.S. government, providing a significant boost to Intel's ongoing turnaround efforts. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, will see Intel build central processing units for Nvidia's advanced AI platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 19-year-old Brilyn Hollyhand has announced a multi-state university speaking tour sponsored by Turning Point USA. The "One Conversation at a Time" tour aims to engage young voters and build upon Kirk's legacy of fostering face-to-face debate on college campuses. Hollyhand, a longtime associate of Kirk, stated the goal is to ensure the conservative youth movement is not silenced by violence, despite facing increased personal security threats. The tour is set to visit ten major universities in the southeastern U.S. to promote dialogue and conservative principles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Arie Perliger, a scholar specializing in political violence, argues that the public discourse following Charlie Kirk's killing focuses too heavily on the shooter's individual politics. He suggests that broader societal conditions, such as extreme political polarization and government dysfunction, create an environment that facilitates such violent acts. Perliger's research indicates that when people lose faith in the political system's effectiveness, they may turn to violence as a perceived shortcut to enact change. He emphasizes that the consistent demonization of political rivals contributes to an atmosphere where violence becomes increasingly normalized.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic about passing a 52-day short-term government funding measure, while Democrats have signaled their strong opposition. The Republican proposal includes increased funding for member security but does not address Democratic demands to restore Medicaid cuts and extend Obamacare subsidies. Democrats have presented a counter-proposal for a shorter extension that includes their healthcare priorities, which Republicans are unlikely to accept. With a slim majority, Johnson faces a challenging vote in the House, and the bill would also require bipartisan support to pass the Senate.</p>

President Donald Trump and other high-profile figures are expected to attend the service at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, with crowd estimates potentially exceeding 100,000 people.

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK was marked by elaborate ceremony, which the U.S. President appeared to genuinely enjoy, particularly the royal reception at Windsor Castle. While the trip successfully demonstrated a warm personal relationship between Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, it seems to have had little impact on U.S. policy regarding trade or international affairs. According to a BBC analysis, Starmer has managed to navigate disagreements on issues like Palestinian statehood without causing a diplomatic rift. The visit appears to have earned the UK the ability to disagree with Trump respectfully without facing punitive measures.</p>

This evolution created the modern university, a hybrid institution that has never fully resolved its contradictory goals.

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster. The suit alleges the companies facilitated a system where ticket brokers could acquire large quantities of tickets and resell them at inflated prices, costing consumers billions. The complaint accuses Ticketmaster of deceptive "bait-and-switch pricing" and of privately benefiting from brokers while publicly claiming to oppose them. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of illegally monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has deported the first migrant to France under a new bilateral agreement aimed at deterring small boat crossings of the English Channel. The "one in, one out" pilot scheme involves exchanging migrants, with the UK accepting a person from France for each one it returns. The first individual, an Indian national, was removed on a flight to Paris. The government plans more deportation flights in the coming days, though the program faces numerous legal challenges from individuals claiming they are victims of modern slavery, which could delay or block their removal.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 200m world final, sprinter Noah Lyles has been engaging in psychological tactics, or "mind games," to unsettle his rivals, a common practice in elite athletics. Experts and former athletes like Ato Boldon note that such strategies can be effective but also risk backfiring if they provide motivation to competitors. Tactics range from outspoken comments to projecting quiet confidence in the tense call room environment before a race. While some athletes use these methods to address their own insecurities, others see it as a way to gain a crucial mental edge when physical differences are minimal.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a move to decertify the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System. The action was taken due to what Kennedy described as a long record of deficiencies, patient safety failures, and repeated violations of federal requirements. The announcement is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to reform the nation's organ transplant system and restore public trust, following reports of procedural failures and safety concerns. HHS is also reforming the national network and investing in new ways to encourage organ donation.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a former tropical storm moves through the region, prompting flood watches in several areas. While the rain provides a temporary reprieve from dry conditions, meteorologists say it is unlikely to be enough to pull the region out of severe drought or substantially reduce the risk of a dangerous wildfire season. Fire officials typically require two to four inches of rain to consider the fire threat diminished, a total this storm is not expected to deliver. The rain may, however, slightly slow the start of the most dangerous part of fire season.</p>

          <p>The New York Department of Taxation and Finance will begin mailing one-time "inflation refund" checks to more than 8 million eligible residents starting in late September. The payments, ranging from $150 to $400, are intended to provide relief from higher sales taxes resulting from inflation. Eligibility is based on income thresholds and filing status from the 2023 tax year, and qualified individuals do not need to apply to receive the payment. The program is funded by surplus state revenue generated from sales taxes on higher-priced goods, a direct consequence of recent inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following government pressure demonstrates the vital role humor plays as a bulwark in a free society, according to this opinion article. Historically, satire has been a powerful tool for mocking authority and spotlighting uncomfortable truths, from Benjamin Franklin to modern late-night hosts. Autocratic regimes worldwide have consistently sought to silence comedians because humor can puncture propaganda and undermine authority in ways traditional media cannot. The author argues that the capitulation by a major corporation like Disney is a worrying sign of institutions eroding under political pressure, threatening a crucial form of expression.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The administration had attempted to expel the children over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the families' request. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return, citing a Guatemalan government report that contradicted the administration's claims. The ruling protects minors who have pending immigration cases and are entitled to due process under U.S. law.</p>
