          <p>Uriah Rennie, the first black Premier League referee, has died at the age of 65, having officiated over 300 games between 1997 and 2008. Rennie broke barriers and inspired future generations, making history as the Premier League's first Black referee. Recently, he had been learning to walk again after a rare condition left him paralyzed from the waist down. Born in Jamaica, he moved to Sheffield as a child and became a magistrate in Sheffield in 1996, campaigning on issues including equality and inclusion in sport, mental health and tackling deprivation. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Sheffield Hallam University in November 2023 and installed as the university's chancellor in May. The optimism score reflects the recognition of his achievements and the legacy he leaves behind.</p>

          <p>Protests erupted in Los Angeles following immigration enforcement operations, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, resulting in arrests and property damage. President Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard in response to what he described as violence and unrest, while California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory. Demonstrators blocked freeways, vandalized vehicles, and clashed with police, prompting a citywide dispersal order and a tactical alert from the LAPD. The ICE spokesperson said immigration enforcement operations have resulted in the arrest of a "domestic abuser" and a "child sexual assaulter". The situation remains tense, with ongoing protests and concerns about the militarization of law enforcement in response to civil unrest.</p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, falling over 34% and marking the steepest drop in more than five years, influenced by ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Overall exports rose 4.8%, but imports plunged 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand. This decline in exports to the U.S. was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. The trade surplus increased 25% year on year to $103.2 billion, but the drop in exports to the U.S. highlights the impact of trade policies on economic activity (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed expanding the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of oceans. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation and comes amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling. The extension would cover 41 of the UK's 178 MPAs, protecting marine animals and seabed habitats, while pressure builds for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty at the Ocean Conference.</p>
