          <p>A woman who was sexually assaulted on a Qatar Airways flight to London is being denied compensation from the UK's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Although her attacker was successfully prosecuted and jailed under UK law, the scheme's rules do not cover incidents on foreign-registered aircraft. Her lawyers are now calling on the Justice Secretary to close this legal loophole, arguing the current situation is irrational and fails to protect victims of violent crimes on international flights bound for the UK. The experience has left the victim with severe anxiety and unable to afford necessary therapy.</p>

          <p>U.S. investors are pouring significant capital into Europe's top soccer leagues, attracted by soaring club valuations and rapid revenue growth that has increased by 750% since the 1996-97 season. This influx, driven by high wealth aggregation in the U.S. and the relative affordability of European clubs compared to NFL or NBA teams, has led to over 36 clubs having private equity participation. The trend has popularized the multi-club ownership model, which offers marketing and financial benefits but is also attracting increased scrutiny from regulators like UEFA over potential conflicts of interest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tourists are increasingly opting for "coolcations," choosing destinations in cooler climates or traveling during off-peak seasons to avoid the extreme heat and wildfires affecting traditional Southern European hotspots. This shift in travel behavior, driven by climate change concerns, has boosted tourism in Nordic countries, the Baltics, and alpine regions like Slovenia. While this trend helps alleviate overtourism in popular areas, it poses economic challenges for countries like Greece and Spain, which are heavily reliant on summer tourism. Experts predict this trend will solidify, potentially shifting the Mediterranean's peak season to spring and autumn.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing 10,000 striking flight attendants have resumed negotiations for the first time since the strike began, which has caused the cancellation of 700 daily flights and stranded thousands of travelers. The central dispute involves the union's demand for flight attendants to be paid for ground duties, such as boarding passengers, which is not current practice. The strike has been deemed unlawful by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, creating a standoff between the airline, its workers, and the government, which is urging a swift resolution to the disruption.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Reading have discovered that tiny freshwater flatworms, known as planaria, could serve as an ethical substitute for lab rats in developing treatments for mental health disorders like schizophrenia. The study found that the worms react to the antipsychotic drug haloperidol in a manner similar to rodents, becoming significantly less active. This finding builds on previous research using planaria to study drug addiction and could help reduce the number of mice and rats used in neuroscience research, which currently number over a million annually in the UK alone.</p>

Attendees find these structured social gatherings fill a void left by remote work and less-social office environments, providing a valuable way to meet new people outside of digital platforms. This trend reflects a broader rejection of purely online connections in favor of real-life interactions.</p>

          <p>A former coach at Chow’s Gymnastics in Iowa, an academy known for training Olympic champions, has been arrested by the FBI on a federal child pornography charge. The coach, Sean Gardner, was previously accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at the academy and secretly recording others in a bathroom at a prior job. Despite being suspended by the U.S. Center for SafeSport in 2022, his disciplinary case remains unresolved, and the criminal investigation was dormant until a new victim came forward in 2024. The case highlights concerns about the slow and opaque processes for sanctioning abusive coaches in Olympic sports.</p>

          <p>While the United States experienced its largest-ever collapse of commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a record 15 million colonies, solidifying its position as the world's top apiary producer. According to Chinese researchers, the key difference lies in management practices. The U.S. model features large-scale, clustered operations with thousands of hives and minimal intervention, whereas Chinese beekeeping involves more hands-on, smaller-scale management. This contrast in approach is highlighted as the fundamental reason for the diverging fates of honeybee populations in the two countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's military operations in Gaza, such as suspending trade agreements, is rooted in structural racism. The author argues that the EU's response stands in stark contrast to its swift and severe sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that Palestinian lives are treated as expendable. This double standard, shaped by a lingering colonial mindset, undermines the EU's credibility as a defender of international law.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' winning streak ended with a 4-3 walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, highlighted by two critical defensive mistakes from right fielder Teoscar Hernández. In the third inning, a poor throw allowed a runner to advance, leading to two runs, and in the ninth, he failed to secure a catch on a bloop fly, which set up the game-winning single. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, stating Hernández "has to get better" defensively. The loss raises questions about the team's defensive alignment, particularly whether six-time Gold Glove winner Mookie Betts should be moved back to right field from shortstop.</p>

Many are unable to leave their vessels without forfeiting months of salary, which they need to repay job agent fees.

          <p>Following talks at the White House, President Trump announced he is arranging a meeting between Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to be followed by a trilateral summit. During the meeting with European leaders, Trump also hinted at U.S. involvement in security guarantees for Ukraine but dismissed the immediate need for a ceasefire, a point on which European leaders pushed back. For his part, Zelenskyy engaged in a charm offensive, avoiding the confrontational tone of his previous visit and emphasizing gratitude for U.S. support, while also mentioning a potential $90 billion arms deal as part of the security guarantees.</p>

As the latest variant of the Type 99 series, which entered service in 2001, the 55-tonne vehicle features an improved 125mm smoothbore main gun and a larger turret. While much of China's military focus has been on its navy and air force, the continued development of advanced land systems like the Type 99A underscores their perceived importance in modern warfare, a lesson reinforced by recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has voiced concerns that the artificial intelligence sector may be in an investment bubble, with startup valuations becoming "insane." While he believes AI is profoundly important for the future, he acknowledged that investor overexcitement is driving froth in the market and warned that some investors are "likely to get very burnt." Despite these concerns, Altman affirmed OpenAI's aggressive spending strategy, stating the company expects to spend trillions on datacenter construction to meet the growing demand for AI compute power, viewing it as a necessary investment in technological progress.

          <p>Dozens of new Tesla vehicles have been photographed parked on public streets in Long Beach, California, with 72-hour tow warnings, sparking questions about the company's inventory management. The images surface as Tesla reports a year-over-year sales decline of over 12% in the U.S. and faces increasing competition in the electric vehicle market. For two consecutive quarters, the company's vehicle production has outpaced deliveries, leading to an accumulation of unsold cars. This situation raises concerns among some customers and analysts about shifting buyer confidence and the brand's ability to move its products efficiently.</p>

The deal makes SoftBank one of Intel's largest shareholders and serves as a significant vote of confidence in the company, which has struggled to capitalize on the AI boom and is heavily investing in its new manufacturing business. The investment comes amid reports that the U.S. government is also considering taking an equity stake in Intel to support its domestic chip production efforts.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has warned that the United States may be underestimating the threat posed by China's rapid progress in artificial intelligence. He expressed skepticism that U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductors are a reliable long-term solution, as Chinese companies are developing domestic alternatives and finding workarounds. Altman noted that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models. He cautioned that the AI race is complex, involving not just chip capacity but also research and product development, making it more than a simple scoreboard of who is ahead.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats have ended their two-week walkout and returned to the state, allowing a Republican-led redistricting effort to proceed. Their protest was a strategic move that prompted California Democrats to introduce their own counter-proposal: a new congressional map that could add up to five Democratic seats in the U.S. House. The California plan, which must be approved by voters in a special election, is a direct response to Republican efforts in Texas and other states to redraw maps in their favor. This sets the stage for a high-stakes, state-by-state political battle over congressional representation ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's stringent anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric are reportedly causing some U.S. citizens, particularly those with immigrant parents, to consider leaving the country. Amid fears of ICE raids and uncertainty over birthright citizenship, some American-born individuals are seeking dual citizenship and exploring opportunities abroad as a "plan B" for their families' safety and future. This trend is not limited to the Latino community, as a record number of Americans have also recently applied for British citizenship. The article suggests a growing sense of instability and lack of safety is driving this consideration among a subset of the U.S. population.</p>
