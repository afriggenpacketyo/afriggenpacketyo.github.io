          <p>A large protest occurred in a Boston suburb after ICE agents arrested 18-year-old Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, a high school student, while he was on his way to volleyball practice. Gomes Da Silva, who entered the U.S. on a student visa that has since lapsed, is eligible for asylum. ICE officials defended the arrest, stating that Gomes Da Silva is in the country illegally and they will enforce all immigration laws. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey expressed her outrage, and a federal judge issued an emergency order to prevent Gomes Da Silva's transfer out of state while his lawsuit is pending. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding immigration enforcement and the rights of undocumented individuals. The optimism score reflects the tension and division surrounding immigration policy. </p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam singles title, overcame Norrie's challenge, though Norrie felt he could have applied more pressure with better execution. Djokovic is set to face Alexander Zverev in the next round, a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final where Zverev emerged victorious after Djokovic sustained a hamstring injury. Jack Draper's loss to Alexander Bublik means that no British players remain in the singles competition at the French Open.</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a large-scale drone attack, dubbed "Spider Web," targeting Russian air bases deep within Russia, including those housing nuclear-capable bombers. The operation, which took over a year and a half to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that 117 drones were used in the attack, which aimed to strike legitimate military targets and cause significant losses to Russia. The operation is viewed as a strategic and symbolic blow, demonstrating Ukraine's ability to adapt and evolve its military tactics using drones, even with a limited amount of resources available to them. </p>

          <p>Opening a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in June could be a strategic financial move for savers, as the Federal Reserve is likely to implement rate cuts later in the summer. Locking in current rates, which are still relatively high, can protect against market volatility and ensure a steady return on investment. Depending on the CD term and interest rate, savers could earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest. It is important to consider the tax implications and ensure the money can remain untouched for the entire CD term to avoid penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being a four-time NBA champion and one of the greatest shooters of all time, Stephen Curry admits to experiencing impostor syndrome. Curry, the son of former NBA star Dell Curry, said he didn't grow up with the expectation to play in the league, which contributed to his underdog mentality. He has embraced this status and used it as motivation throughout his career. Curry also heads Thirty Ink, a house of brands, and is passionate about giving back through his nonprofit Eat. Learn. Play.</p>

The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is alleged to have planned the attack for a year, watching videos on how to make Molotov cocktails before targeting a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages. Soliman told police he wanted to "kill all Zionist people", according to court documents. The victims, aged between 52 and 88, have been taken to hospitals with burns and other injuries.</p>

          <p>Britain's defence review outlines grand ambitions for transforming the armed forces but faces challenges in securing adequate funding. While the review welcomes the government's "ambition" to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that faster progress may be necessary given turbulent times. Even the commitment to build up to 12 new attack submarines would require an increase in defence spending to at least 3% of GDP. The review highlights the war in Ukraine as evidence of rising threats and the fast pace of change.</p>

          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles has resurfaced, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordering military services to make basic fitness standards for all combat jobs gender-neutral.

          <p>An inquest found that a housebound disabled woman killed herself after her mental health deteriorated due to her benefits being incorrectly stopped. Jodey Whiting, from Stockton-on-Tees, was found dead in 2017 after being deemed fit to work, having missed an assessment because she was in hospital with pneumonia. The senior coroner recorded a verdict of suicide due to a "deteriorating mental state" precipitated by the Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) decision. The DWP said it was "deeply regretful" after the inquest heard that Ms Whiting "had lost hope" at the time of her death.</p>
