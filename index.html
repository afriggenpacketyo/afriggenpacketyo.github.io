        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Vance Boelter with six counts, including murder and firearms offenses, in connection with the assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the shooting of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson described the details of the crime as "chilling," noting that Boelter went to the homes of four lawmakers with the intent to kill them. One lawmaker was not home, and another, Senator Ann Rest, was alerted by authorities and avoided the attack. Boelter's arrest followed a 43-hour manhunt, and the Justice Department is considering the death penalty as an option.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill in California proposes to make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and officers responding to natural disasters. Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin introduced the bill to promote transparency and public trust in law enforcement. They cited recent instances of federal officers conducting raids with covered faces and unmarked vehicles, raising concerns about accountability. The proposal seeks to ensure that law enforcement officers are identifiable to the public, fostering greater transparency and accountability in their actions.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Club World Cup campaign began with a match played before a stadium with many empty seats, raising questions about fan interest in the revamped tournament. Experts suggest that factors such as the Monday afternoon kickoff time, high ticket prices, and lack of marketing contributed to the low attendance. Some observers worry that this apathy could extend to the upcoming World Cup in 2026 if FIFA does not address these issues. The incident serves as an early warning for FIFA to consider realistic ticket pricing and effective marketing strategies for future events.</p>

Trump also discussed trade with leaders, including Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada, emphasizing his stance as a "tariff person." He also mentioned the possibility of allowing China to join the G7 and addressed Vladimir Putin's exclusion from the group in 2014.</p>

          <p>New audio has surfaced of Travis Decker pleading with a judge for more visitation time with his three daughters, whom he is now accused of murdering. Decker's visitation time had been reduced due to concerns about endangerment, mental health, and communication issues. During a family court hearing in September 2024, Decker expressed frustration with the parenting plan, arguing that it limited his opportunities to be around his daughters. Decker's children were allegedly heard crying during an overnight visit, and he failed to return them by the agreed-upon curfew on May 30, leading to the discovery of their bodies and a manhunt for Decker.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent statements about intensifying immigration enforcement in Los Angeles have created confusion, following reports of a directive to pause arrests at certain worksites. The president stated that officials "must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens," while multiple news outlets reported that ICE would halt worksite enforcement in agriculture, restaurants, and hotels. Protests have continued in Los Angeles, with clashes between residents, advocates, and law enforcement, as the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule on California's bid to stop the deployment of National Guard troops in the city.
