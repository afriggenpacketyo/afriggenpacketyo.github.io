          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have observed the initial stages of rocky planet formation around a newborn, sun-like star named HOPS-315. This discovery provides a direct look at a process similar to how Earth may have formed over 4.5 billion years ago. The observations detected silicate minerals condensing in the star's gas disk, a key building block for terrestrial planets. This finding suggests that the formation of Earth-like worlds might be a common occurrence in the universe, offering crucial insights into the origins of our own solar system.</p>

          <p>The mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern fatally shot in Washington, D.C., is pleading for the arrest of his killers. Tarpinian-Jachym was an unintended victim in a shooting that also injured two others, and his mother warns that such violence could happen to anyone. She has called on the city's mayor to address the rising homicide rate, highlighting the tragedy's proximity to the White House. The FBI has joined the Metropolitan Police Department in the investigation, as no suspects are currently in custody.</p>

          <p>In response to a forthcoming 30% tariff from the United States, South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to address a significant trade imbalance. A high-level South African delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify exports beyond commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy tech. Deputy President Paul Mashatile highlighted the nation's growing trade deficit with China, which reached nearly $10 billion in 2023. Observers note that while China is a crucial alternative market, it presents its own complexities and risks of over-dependence.</p>

          <p>Days of relentless, heavy rainfall across South Korea have resulted in at least 14 fatalities and left 12 people missing. The southern regions of the country were particularly hard-hit, with landslides and flash floods destroying homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. In the town of Sancheong, eight deaths were reported due to landslides, while other fatalities occurred from house collapses and swollen streams. While the downpour has subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the event highlights the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather, which scientists attribute to climate change.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by 2030, setting the first clear target on the issue. This commitment follows public outrage over pollution and data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution to protect wildlife. While the goal is seen as admirable, critics point out it is a political pledge rather than a legally binding requirement, raising questions about government accountability.</p>

While the political debate often centers on the perceived bias of national networks like NPR, the real-world consequences are felt in areas with limited internet access where local radio is a vital lifeline.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the futile search for peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems not just from political failure, but from a deeper crisis of morality. The author, Simon Tisdall, suggests the world is ethically fractured, lacking a "permanent moral order" or universally accepted standards, which makes resolving conflicts nearly impossible. This moral relativism allows atrocities to continue, as what is indefensible to one group is justified by another. The piece calls for a return to shared ethical responsibilities, as defined by international law and social contracts, as a necessary step toward achieving lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu's career is at a crossroads after a second consecutive defeat to American Sebastian Fundora in their world title rematch in Las Vegas. The fight was stopped in the seventh round by Tszyu's corner, marking his third loss in four bouts. Tszyu struggled with the significant height and reach advantage of the 197cm Fundora, who dropped him in the first round and opened a cut over his eye in the second.

          <h2>United States to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Most Visitors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 23:07:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be implemented starting in the 2025 fiscal year. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with all visa conditions, such as not overstaying their visit. However, significant questions remain about the implementation process, and immigration experts advise clients to treat the fee as nonrefundable due to the expected difficulty in obtaining the money back.
