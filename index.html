        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores a growing sense of economic disillusionment among Gen Z, with nearly half feeling that planning for the future is pointless, according to a Credit Karma poll. Experts attribute this sentiment to a challenging labor market for new entrants, significant student debt burdens, and the ease of accumulating high-interest debt through services like "buy now, pay later." This "YOLO mindset" could lead to long-term financial implications, including delayed milestones and difficulty saving for retirement. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of developing healthy financial habits early, even with small investments, to harness the power of compound interest. Experts are trying to get young people to understand that there are opportunities for them to be able to invest as much as they can right now. </p>

          <p>The article reports that the death of a 9-year-old girl following a dental surgery in San Diego County has been attributed to a rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia. The medical examiner suggests the condition could have been triggered by anesthetic medications, including nitrous oxide, administered during the procedure. Experts explain that methemoglobinemia disrupts oxygen delivery in the body, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath and cyanosis. The dental facility where the surgery took place stated that the death was due to the girl's undiagnosed medical condition, and there were no clear signs of it before the surgery. The San Diego Police Department has closed its investigation into the matter. </p>

          <p>The article examines how immigration raids in Barrio Obrero, a Dominican community in San Juan, Puerto Rico, have altered daily life since President Trump took office. The sweeps have led to increased fear and anxiety among residents, resulting in emptier restaurants and fewer church attendees. Advocates, lawyers, and politicians have formed alliances to challenge Trump's immigration policies. The story highlights the experiences of Juan Vega Paredes, an undocumented immigrant arrested while buying avocados, and the broader impact of these enforcement operations on the community. The situation underscores the vulnerability of immigrant communities under stricter immigration policies. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that the UK government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers. Despite efforts to reduce costs, the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the previous year. The money is primarily used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers in the UK. Critics argue that diverting foreign aid for domestic purposes undermines humanitarian and development priorities overseas. The situation highlights the challenges in managing asylum costs and maintaining international aid commitments. </p>

          <p>A major fire that devastated part of the former home of the state operetta in Germany's eastern city of Dresden has been extinguished, authorities said. The blaze erupted on Friday evening, prompting an emergency response by up to 150 firefighters. The theater, located in the east of the city, was once home to one of Germany's oldest operetta ensembles, dating back over 240 years. The building has lain empty for years. The cause of the fire is under investigation. </p>
