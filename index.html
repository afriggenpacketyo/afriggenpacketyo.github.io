          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned regarding unregulated concierge clinics following the collapse of Apricity Fertility, leaving many without treatment or refunds. These online firms act as intermediaries between patients, donors, and doctors, but the fertility watchdog, HFEA, lacks the authority to regulate them. Syreeta Sandhu, who lost Â£15,000, highlights the emotional and financial toll on patients. The HFEA is advocating for revisions to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to address the evolving landscape of fertility services, as more patients seek private treatment due to NHS limitations.

          <p>A German court has overturned the ban on the right-wing extremist magazine "Compact," citing freedom of opinion and the press. Former Interior Minister Nancy Faeser banned the magazine in 2024, arguing it incited hatred against various groups. The court, however, deemed terms like "remigration" and "cult of guilt" protected under freedom of expression. Compact's editor-in-chief, JÃ¼rgen ElsÃ¤sser, celebrated the decision as a victory against dictatorial tendencies, while also suggesting it could impact attempts to ban the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court found a U.S. Marine, Lance Cpl. Jamel Clayton, guilty of sexual assault on Okinawa and sentenced him to seven years in prison.

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's program by only a few months, contrary to President Trump's claims of complete obliteration. The assessment indicates that entrances to enrichment facilities were sealed, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. The White House disputes the assessment, while some officials maintain the strikes were devastating. This discrepancy raises questions about the urgency of renewed negotiations with Iran and the actual impact of the military action.</p>

          <p>Despite initial concerns, the conflict between Israel and Iran has not led to an oil crisis due to several factors. Iran has not targeted oil supplies, and oil traders have learned to be skeptical of price spikes. The approaching autumn season in the Northern Hemisphere typically reduces oil demand. The world has an oversupply of oil, and the U.S. has become a dominant oil producer. These factors have made the oil market resilient to geopolitical shocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite claims of complete obliteration, America's bunker-busting bombs may have failed to destroy Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment site, according to a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment. The bombs, known as Massive Ordnance Penetrators, may not have penetrated deep enough due to the type of rock at the site. A 2005 study found that the depth a bomb can reach depends on factors like the shape of the nosecone, the weight, the speed, and the type of earth it gets dropped on, with the type of rock playing a key role.</p>

Secretary General Mark Rutte has reassured allies of Washington's commitment but emphasized the expectation that European and Canadian allies will increase their spending.
