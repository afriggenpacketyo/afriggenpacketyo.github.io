          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:59:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the author, emotionally safe parenting prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, viewing misbehavior as a stress signal, and taking responsibility after conflicts by apologizing. To practice this, parents should reflect on their own childhood triggers, see behavior as communication, set boundaries with empathy, and model healthy conflict resolution. By creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves, parents can foster emotional resilience and connection.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed readiness to swiftly negotiate a trade deal with the United States but indicated the EU needs until July 9 to finalize an agreement. This follows President Trump's threat to impose a 20% tariff on most EU goods, later halved to 10% until July 8 to allow for negotiations. Trump has long criticized the trade relationship with the EU, despite the bloc being a major trading partner. European leaders are advocating for a diplomatic solution, warning that tariffs would harm both economies.</p>

          <p>President Zelensky stated that the US's perceived lack of response to recent Russian attacks emboldens Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial assault since the 2022 invasion. The overnight attack involved 367 drones and missiles, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including three children, and numerous injuries across Ukraine. Zelensky urged stronger international pressure on Russia, while the only US reaction came from Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, condemning the attacks. The Ukrainian president believes further sanctions are needed to deter Moscow's aggression and encourage meaningful ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his family are increasingly monetizing his position, engaging in activities that would have previously sparked outrage and investigations. The Trump family has collected millions from ventures like a new cryptocurrency, overseas real estate deals, and an exclusive club in Washington. Critics argue that Trump has dismantled accountability measures, normalizing moneymaking schemes and erasing ethical boundaries, leading to a lack of public uproar despite potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Cindy McCain, the executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, stated that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza is only a "drop in the bucket" compared to what is needed to prevent famine. She warned that the Israeli blockade has created a catastrophe for 2.3 million Palestinians, with 500,000 people facing extreme food insecurity. McCain also refuted claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it to desperate people seeking food.</p>
