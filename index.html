          <p>A major Nigerian oil workers' union, PENGASSAN, has concluded its two-day strike at the Dangote refinery following negotiations with company management and government officials. The dispute arose after the union accused the company of dismissing 800 unionized workers and replacing them with foreign labor, a claim Dangote refuted by citing staff reorganization. Under the agreement, the strike will be called off while Dangote begins the process of relocating the disengaged employees to other companies within its group. The resolution aims to restore normal operations at Africa's largest oil refinery.</p>

Meanwhile, Israel's Defense Minister has issued a final warning for civilians to evacuate south as the military tightens its encirclement of the city.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing plummeted by 21% last week after interest rates reversed a recent downward trend and rose to their highest level in three weeks. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the increase in rates, driven by stronger-than-expected economic data, has diminished the incentive for homeowners to refinance. Applications for home purchases also saw a slight decline, impacted by broader economic conditions and falling housing inventory. The future direction of mortgage rates remains uncertain, with the release of the monthly employment report potentially delayed by the government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the first day of a government shutdown, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote again on two funding bills that previously failed to advance, indicating a continued stalemate. Congressional leaders from both parties are publicly blaming each other for the lapse in funding, with Republicans urging Democrats to support a clean, short-term bill. Democrats, however, are holding their position, seeking to include healthcare provisions in the funding measure. With a 60-vote threshold required for passage in the Senate, the focus remains on whether either side will concede to avoid a prolonged shutdown.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a freeze on approximately $18 billion in federal funding for major infrastructure projects in New York City, coinciding with the first day of the government shutdown. The White House Office of Management and Budget cited the state's use of "unconstitutional DEI principles" as the reason for halting funds for the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway. The move is seen by many as politically motivated, targeting the home state of top Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, whom Republicans blame for the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey is returning to film in "The Lost Bus," a true story about the 2018 California wildfires, while also promoting his new bestselling book, "Poems and Prayers." He revealed that the book is a collection of personal writings he began 36 years ago as a way to make sense of the world and combat cynicism. In the interview, McConaughey also confirmed that he still considers a future in politics, though he remains uncertain if it is the most effective way for him to be of service.

          <p>The Oktoberfest festival in Munich, Germany, was temporarily shut down but has since reopened following a security sweep by police. The closure was prompted by a non-specific bomb threat found in a letter linked to a fatal house fire in the northern part of the city. Authorities believe a 57-year-old man started the fire, which was rigged with explosives, as part of a family dispute before his body was found at a nearby lake. After explosives specialists and sniffer dogs cleared the festival grounds, the popular event was deemed safe to resume.</p>

Chisholm, who recently joined the prestigious 30-30 club with 31 home runs and 31 stolen bases, gave short, begrudging answers to reporters' questions.

Parks without fee collection capabilities will not be operated, and no visitor services will be provided in those locations.

Migration experts note that losing access to an EU fingerprint database has also complicated the UK's ability to process and return asylum seekers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor reported an 8.2% increase in its third-quarter U.S. sales, driven by significant growth in its electric vehicle and large SUV segments. Sales of all-electric vehicles surged by over 30% to a new quarterly record, with the Mustang Mach-E model alone seeing a 51% jump. This sales boost is partly attributed to consumers purchasing EVs ahead of the expiration of federal incentives at the end of September. The overall auto industry is expected to show strong third-quarter results, with EV sales forecast to reach a record high market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold surged to a new record high as the U.S. government shutdown began, increasing investor demand for safe-haven assets. Spot gold surpassed $3,894 per ounce, fueled by the political instability and the potential delay of critical economic data, which clouds the outlook for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Analysts suggest that while the shutdown was the immediate catalyst, the rally is also supported by ongoing geopolitical conflicts and persistent global inflation. Some strategists believe gold could continue its upward trend, viewing it as an under-owned asset in diversified investment portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Healthcare experts are advising new Medicare enrollees about the critical importance of the Medigap open enrollment period, a one-time, six-month window to purchase supplemental insurance. This period begins when an individual turns 65 and enrolls in Medicare Part B, and it guarantees them the right to buy any Medigap policy sold in their state without facing denial or higher premiums due to pre-existing health conditions. Missing this window can result in being denied coverage later or facing significantly higher costs, making it a crucial step for seniors seeking to manage out-of-pocket healthcare expenses in retirement.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco and named rookie Dillon Gabriel as the starter for their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings in London. The decision comes after a 1-3 start to the season, with the offense struggling and ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, has seen limited action but performed well in the preseason. The move also brings renewed attention to fifth-round pick Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, who remains the team's third-string quarterback.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has paused abortion services due to a new federal law that blocks providers receiving significant Medicaid reimbursements from participating in the program for one year. While federal Medicaid funds cannot be used for most abortions, clinics rely on these reimbursements for other essential services like cancer screenings and contraception. The Wisconsin affiliate appears to be halting abortions temporarily to maintain its eligibility for Medicaid funding for its other healthcare services. The situation highlights the financial strain placed on reproductive healthcare providers by the new provision, which primarily targets Planned Parenthood.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has started construction on a 27-mile section of border wall in southern Arizona's San Rafael Valley, a region known for its high biodiversity. The 30-foot-high steel barrier is replacing lower vehicle barriers and will cut through a critical wildlife corridor, threatening the migration patterns of species like jaguars and ocelots. Conservation groups and local residents are concerned about the environmental impact, including the severing of ecosystems and the depletion of groundwater for concrete production.

          <p>An analysis suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully influenced President Donald Trump's recently announced Gaza peace plan, shaping it into terms favorable to Israel. The 20-point proposal, presented as a U.S. initiative, largely reflects Netanyahu's long-standing demands for Hamas to disarm while allowing Israeli troops to remain in parts of Gaza. Critics argue that Trump, after months of inaction, has presented a plan that functions more as an ultimatum for Hamas to surrender than a balanced ceasefire agreement. This outcome is viewed as another instance of Netanyahu outmaneuvering a U.S. president to achieve his strategic goals.</p>

          <p>A new opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's proposal to increase the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 will have a devastating impact on the U.S. healthcare system. Many foreign-trained physicians enter the country on H-1B visas and are crucial for staffing hospitals in rural and underserved areas that American graduates often avoid. The author contends that this policy will effectively cut off this vital pipeline of doctors, leading to shuttered clinics and reduced access to care for vulnerable populations. The article frames the issue not as an immigration problem, but as a failure of the U.S. to adequately invest in its domestic medical workforce.</p>

The court found that PPE Medpro, recommended by Mone through a government "VIP lane," supplied medical gowns that were not properly sterilized. SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn argued that there must be consequences and that Mone should no longer be in the House of Lords.
