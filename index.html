          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 00:04:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide, as many countries grapple with whether to devalue their currencies. A weaker dollar provides some relief by easing the burden of dollar-denominated debt and potentially lowering inflation through cheaper imports, which gives central banks more flexibility to cut interest rates. However, currency devaluation poses risks such as stoking inflation and inviting retaliatory trade measures from the U.S., making central banks cautious about aggressive interventions. Central banks are generally avoiding a currency war to prevent further economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss trade relations, with both sides reporting significant progress towards a potential trade deal. The talks are particularly timely as India seeks to finalize an agreement before the expiration of a pause on tariffs announced by the Trump administration.

Vance's visit is seen as an opportunity to pave the way for a visit by Trump later in the year for a summit with the Quad countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under court order to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a judge granted a temporary restraining order. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated the students' records in a database, potentially leading to their deportation. Many of the students affected are near graduation or enrolled in work programs, and some had minor charges dropped. The lawsuit argues that the terminations appear designed to coerce students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed both U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs and housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson in the Republican primary for Arizona governor. This unusual move comes after Trump's initial endorsement of Robson angered some of his allies who preferred a candidate more aligned with his "Make America Great Again" movement. Biggs, a former chair of the House Freedom Caucus, is a close ally of Trump and supports his claims about the 2020 election.

          <p>The wife of detained Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil has accused federal immigration officials of purposely denying his request to attend the birth of their first child. Noor Abdalla gave birth to a baby boy without her husband by her side, as ICE declined to grant Khalil temporary release from a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil, a legal permanent U.S. resident and graduate student, served as a spokesperson for campus activists protesting Israel's treatment of Palestinians. The federal government contends Khalil is a national security risk.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1-billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, including approximately 1,650 layoffs. The plan includes deep spending reductions for many agencies, with over 400 civilian positions at the LAPD targeted for layoffs. While the Fire Department would see new hires, many other agencies would face significant cuts as the city deals with rising personnel costs and a slowing economy. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging interference in academic decision-making after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding. The lawsuit comes after Harvard rejected demands to appoint an outside overseer and ensure viewpoint diversity. The university argues that the government should not dictate what private universities can teach or whom they can admit. The Trump administration has criticized campus protests related to the war in Gaza and accused institutions of allowing antisemitism.</p>

The goal is to develop a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years. The initial experiment involves sending a small bioreactor containing yeast into orbit to test the process in low gravity and higher radiation.</p>
