          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, marking a significant victory for the center-left Labor Party amid global uncertainties stemming from the Trump administration. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation projected Albanese's win shortly after polls closed, signaling a resounding defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who also lost his parliamentary seat. Voters expressed concerns about the rising cost of living, but both parties offered largely incremental relief proposals rather than addressing fundamental economic challenges. Albanese's victory speech emphasized Australia's commitment to facing global challenges in its own way, distancing the nation from overseas influences, particularly those associated with Trump-era policies.</p>

          <p>George Clooney was seen playing softball in Central Park, seemingly unfazed by reports that his wife, Amal Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, may face difficulties entering the United States due to her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and new sanctions under President Trump's executive order. Amal reportedly advised on a war crimes case against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, leading to the possibility of entry restrictions. Trump's order claims the ICC has engaged in baseless actions targeting America and its allies, including Israel, and threatens to block property and assets, as well as suspend entry into the US for ICC officials and their families. The Clooneys, who have homes worldwide, have recently been residing in New York with their children.</p>

          <p>Over 25 million Americans along the East Coast are under alert for severe weather, including damaging winds, large hail, and potential tornadoes, as a storm system shifts eastward. New storms are expected to develop from the Carolinas to New York, posing risks of flash flooding, particularly in the Northeast. The storm system is part of an "omega block pattern," creating a sharp contrast in weather conditions across a wide area. Earlier, large hail and reports of downed trees and power lines were widespread from Texas to Ohio, with isolated structural damage in Texas. The weather pattern is expected to move into the central U.S. by Monday, bringing renewed severe weather and flash flood threats to central Texas.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring long, unnarrated coverage of real-time events, has gained popularity with nature livestreams showing jellyfish, storks, and elk migrations attracting millions of viewers. The 'Great Elk Trek' in Sweden drew over 9 million viewers last year, offering a calming contrast to fast-paced media. Zoos and wildlife projects also use webcams to allow the public to observe animals and their behaviors, providing a window into the wild. Experts believe slow TV fosters a deeper connection with nature, promoting conservationist attitudes and inspiring climate-conscious behavior, though it cannot fully replace real-world experiences.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student, has warned about the US's descent into authoritarianism after being detained and ordered deported by the Trump administration for his Palestinian rights advocacy. Mahdawi, who was arrested during his citizenship interview, believes the government is attempting to smear him for opposing war and promoting peace. He criticizes the administration for mirroring Israel's playbook by denying rights and eliminating due process under the guise of security. Mahdawi argues that the administration's actions send a clear message that there is no room for dissent and free speech is being suppressed.</p>

          <p>Residents of Oakdale, California, have shifted from traditional media to online sources like Facebook groups and podcasters for news, leading to widespread distrust and misinformation. The decline of local newspapers and the rise of partisan narratives have left residents feeling less informed, culminating in an incident where an armed militia stormed the town based on false rumors spread on Facebook. Efforts to moderate misinformation have led to splinter groups and further polarization, with some residents turning to alternative news sources like The Epoch Times. The town's experience reflects a broader trend in small communities across the country, where trust in traditional media has waned and the search for truth has become increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>An aerial bombing targeted a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) facility in Old Fangak, South Sudan, resulting in at least seven deaths, including a 9-month-old child, and numerous injuries. MSF condemned the attack on its hospital, which serves as the only source of medical care for 40,000 residents, calling it a clear violation of international humanitarian law. The facility's pharmacy was destroyed, leading to a loss of all medical supplies, and additional strikes occurred near the Old Fangak market, causing panic and displacement. The attack is the latest escalation in a government-led assault on opposition groups across the country, as Old Fangak is associated with the opposition party loyal to Riek Machar.</p>

The company estimates $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027 through expense savings and network benefits, with a significant portion coming from moving payment volume onto the Discover network.

          <h2>Cats and Dogs Evolving to Resemble Each Other Due to Human Influence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes, driven by human selection for traits like flat faces and exaggerated features. Selective breeding has led to convergence, with breeds like Persian cats and pugs sharing similar skull structures despite distant evolutionary histories. The preference for infant-like features taps into human instincts, but these traits often come at a cost, leading to health problems. Experts call for tougher regulation of breeders to prevent preventable, life-limiting conditions.</p>

The airstrikes followed sectarian clashes involving Sunni gunmen and members of the Druze community.

          <p>New research suggests that grizzly bears could potentially return to California, a state where they disappeared in the mid-1920s due to conflicts with humans. The study identifies three regions that could support a robust grizzly population, including the north-west forest, the southern Sierra Nevada, and the south-western region. While public support is crucial, many residents are intrigued by the idea, and proponents say reintroducing them would benefit the ecosystem. Any reintroduction effort would happen slowly, over several decades, starting with a small number of wild-born female bears in remote areas.</p>
