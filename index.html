          <p>Frustrated by the negative experiences and mental fatigue associated with dating apps, 30-year-old Lucy Rout founded Haystack Dating, a company that organizes in-person events. Citing a decline in users for major apps like Tinder and Hinge, Rout's model aims to create safer, more accountable environments for making meaningful connections. Attendees are matched into small groups for activities based on an algorithm that considers their interests and personality traits. The growing popularity of such IRL events reflects a broader trend of people seeking genuine interactions away from the pressures and poor behavior often found online.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he is eight to ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as a significant "gear shift" in his life. The discovery was made during a genetic test for his National Geographic show, revealing he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene. This revelation prompted the 41-year-old actor to reassess his motivations, shifting his focus from career accumulation to contributing more and maximizing quality time with his family. For the second season of his show, he became more involved in the production, exploring topics that were more personal and educational to him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an era of economic instability, a consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, where people spend on both small 'pick-me-ups' and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale. This phenomenon expands on the classic "lipstick effect," as consumers cut back on daily costs but splurge on items like concert tickets or collectibles. Economists note this trend is driven by a sense of uncertainty and the unattainability of traditional milestones like homeownership for younger generations. This shift towards celebrating smaller 'inch-stones' with guilt-free purchases is expected to persist as long as the current economic climate continues.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of vehicle depreciation has identified the top ten models with the worst resale value five years after their initial purchase in 2020. The study found that the average 2025 car will retain only 54.4% of its original price, with electric vehicles featuring prominently among the poorest performers. The BMW i3 tops the list, losing nearly 58% of its value, followed by the Nissan Juke and Nissan Leaf. The report suggests that while initial popularity is high, factors like reliability and practicality ultimately determine long-term value in the secondhand market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a surprisingly strong performance in his first NFL preseason game, throwing two touchdown passes. His successful debut caught the attention of many, including LeBron James, especially after a controversial start to his professional career. Sanders, who was once a top prospect, fell to the 144th pick in the draft amid character concerns and recently faced criticism for two speeding citations. Despite the unsteady beginning, his on-field performance has generated significant positive buzz and discussion throughout the league, with his father, Deion Sanders, celebrating the achievement on social media.</p>

          <p>China's public health response to a recent chikungunya outbreak is reportedly employing intrusive measures reminiscent of its strict COVID-19 playbook. In one instance, a village's Communist Party secretary led a task force to a resident's home to enforce mosquito control measures, discovering stagnant water breeding larvae. Another report detailed community workers attempting to take a blood sample from a child with a fever, a request the parents refused. These actions have sparked public concern and complaints, highlighting ongoing tensions between individual rights and the state's aggressive approach to containing disease outbreaks in the country.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer has died after being shot near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters and Emory University in Atlanta. The incident began when a suspect opened fire, striking the CDC building, before being located by officers at a nearby pharmacy where an exchange of gunfire occurred. The suspect was later found dead from a gunshot wound, which authorities believe may have been self-inflicted. The fallen officer was a husband and father of two, with another child on the way. No civilians were injured, though a day care on the CDC campus was occupied at the time.</p>

This action follows a Department of Justice investigation which concluded that UCLA was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students" during campus protests in the spring of 2024. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has condemned the move as "extortion" and an attack on academic freedom, vowing that the state will not comply with the demand.

The rodents are damaging trees by burrowing in root zones, consuming nuts, and destroying irrigation equipment, with estimated losses ranging from $109 million to $311 million. According to the Almond Board of California, the rats, typically roof-dwellers, are burrowing underground due to a lack of cover in winter.

Recently, major retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have had ads banned for this reason, sparking concerns among some industry experts about a potential return to the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. The ASA states that while the models themselves may not be unhealthy, the use of specific poses, lighting, and styling can create an aspirational image of an unhealthy body type.

          <p>A rapidly spreading brush fire in a mountainous region of Southern California has burned thousands of acres and forced widespread evacuations. The Canyon fire, which started in Ventura County and spread into Los Angeles County, is being fueled by record-low moisture levels in the vegetation and temperatures reaching 100F. Hundreds of firefighters are working to contain the blaze, which was 25% contained as of Friday afternoon. This comes as another major wildfire, the Gifford fire, continues to burn out of control in central California, highlighting the elevated wildfire risk across the state amid an intense heatwave.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly issued a directive authorizing the U.S. military to target Latin American drug cartels, which his administration has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. According to sources, this secret order provides a basis for potential military operations against these groups on foreign soil and at sea. The move is part of Trump's broader strategy to combat the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl into the U.S. The directive has raised concerns in Mexico about potential unilateral U.S. military action, representing a significant escalation in American tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A feature article explores the surprising friendship between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who recently hosted Vance and his family at his official country residence. Despite their starkly different political ideologies—Vance a conservative Republican and Lammy a left-wing Labour politician—the two have bonded over shared experiences of dysfunctional childhoods, their Christian faith, and family life. The article suggests that in an administration where personal relationships are highly valued, this bond could be a significant diplomatic asset for the UK, even as both men have previously made critical remarks about Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Several protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct during a demonstration outside a federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Activists gathered to accuse U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of operating a covert and overcrowded detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building. Demonstrators, who allege detainees are held without basic amenities or legal access, demanded entry to the site but were denied. The protest is one of several recent actions calling for transparency and an end to what they describe as illegal and immoral actions by the federal agency.</p>

          <p>A wave of protests is taking place across the UK against the government's use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers, fueled by local community concerns over safety and a lack of transparency.

While some demonstrations involve far-right activists, many are organized by local residents, including mothers and professionals, who feel their communities are negatively impacted. Critics of the protests warn of rising racist sentiment, while those involved express frustration with the government's handling of the asylum system and its impact on their towns.</p>

          <p>A new, searing biography of Prince Andrew by author Andrew Lownie, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," is set to be released. The book reportedly paints an unrelentingly negative portrait of the prince, detailing his arrogance, poor judgment, and deep connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Based on extensive research and hundreds of interviews, the biography is said to contain numerous unflattering anecdotes about his behavior and financial dealings. Commentators suggest the book will likely cement his public disgrace and eliminate any possibility of a return to royal duties.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The fact-checking article reports that the island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane of that size to land there; visitors typically arrived by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim used a profile picture with a pin from a pilot costume available on Amazon. Trump has publicly denied ever visiting the island.</p>

These centers offer a welcoming, cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can get free ramen, use massage chairs, and connect with social workers and other people. The initiative targets the growing number of socially isolated individuals, particularly young people and the elderly, in a city where nearly 40% of households are single-person. The program aims to provide a low-stigma space for human connection, responding to a rise in "lonely deaths" and the societal pressures of modern urban life.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. Proponents argue this democratizes retirement savings by providing access to potentially high-growth asset classes, while critics highlight the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with these investments. The implementation timeline is uncertain, as it requires significant regulatory updates and adoption by plan providers and employers. Experts suggest adoption may be slow due to the complexity and volatility of these assets. (not investment advice)</p>
