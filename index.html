          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers revealed that he considered advice from his new sister-in-law when deciding to sign with the team. While keeping his personal life intensely private, Rodgers mentioned that his wife's 20-year-old sister, Mia, is "the brains of the family" and played a partial role in his choice. The article also touches on Rodgers' recent marriage to his wife Brittani and his frustration with media intrusion into their private lives. He signed a one-year deal with the Steelers, stating he no longer needed a large salary.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has found Tesla partly liable in a wrongful death lawsuit involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive damages and approximately $43 million in compensatory damages. The case centered on a 2019 crash where a man using Autopilot ran through an intersection, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that recovered data showed the vehicle's system knew it was about to run off the road but failed to act. Tesla has stated it plans to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below economists' expectations. Compounding the weak report, the Labor Department issued major downward revisions for May and June, reducing previous estimates by a combined 258,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2%, suggesting that economic pressures, potentially including trade tariffs, are beginning to have a more pronounced impact on hiring across the country.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the National Science Foundation (NSF) can continue to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding from researchers while a lawsuit challenging the cuts proceeds. Sixteen Democrat-led states sued the NSF after it changed its funding priorities and canceled hundreds of grants, including those focused on diversity, AI, and STEM education. The judge declined to issue a preliminary injunction to immediately restore the payments, stating the states failed to show the NSF's actions were contrary to its mandate.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has indicated it may rule against President Trump's executive order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship, expressing significant doubt about its constitutionality. During a hearing, judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intensely questioned the Justice Department's argument, referencing a key 1898 Supreme Court precedent that has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit, suggesting the policy's ultimate fate will likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

However, it upheld one claim where the finance agreement was deemed "unfair" under the Consumer Credit Act, providing a potential path for other consumers in similar situations.

          <p>Businesses worldwide are grappling with the impact of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, with reactions ranging from temporary relief to deep concern. While Mexico secured a 90-day reprieve, countries like Canada face a hike to 35%, and Switzerland was hit with a surprise 39% rate. The BBC compiled responses from business leaders in various nations, including Thailand, Italy, and Brazil, who described the uncertainty and potential economic damage caused by the reshaped U.S. trade relationships, with many expecting costs to be passed on to consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has dealt a significant blow to Italy's plan to establish offshore asylum processing centers in Albania. The court ruled that Italy's method for designating a country as "safe" for deportation is contrary to EU law, as it must ensure generalized protection for everyone, which can be independently verified. This decision undermines the legal foundation of the agreement with Albania, which relied on quickly deporting denied applicants from so-called safe countries, and is being watched closely by other European nations considering similar offshore policies.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has given birth to a healthy baby boy from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, believed to be the longest storage time ever to result in a live birth. Linda and Tim Pierce used an embryo donated in 1994 through a process known as embryo adoption. The story highlights the growing practice of donating leftover embryos from IVF, offering hope to infertile couples and providing an alternative to discarding them, a topic of increasing ethical debate.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for its actions against the provision of gender-affirming health care for minors. The suit supports children's hospitals and doctors who have faced pressure to cease these services. The states contend that the administration's efforts to interfere with this medical care are illegal and represent an overreach of federal authority. This legal challenge marks a significant pushback against the administration's policies on transgender healthcare.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Some European Songbirds 'Divorce' Between Breeding Seasons</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Oxford University has found that a common European songbird, the great tit, sometimes separates from its partner between breeding seasons. This behavior, which researchers term "divorce," appears to be a strategy employed by the birds. The research provides new insights into the complex social and mating behaviors of birds, suggesting that their partnerships can be more fluid and strategic than previously understood. The findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of animal relationships and evolutionary behaviors.</p>

          <p>The economist who originally coined the acronym BRIC (later BRICS) to describe the rising economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China is reflecting on how the group has evolved. The article explores the alliance's transformation from an investment concept into a formal geopolitical bloc that now includes several other nations. It also delves into why this economic alliance has drawn such strong opposition and animosity from President Trump, who views it as a challenge to U.S. economic and political influence on the global stage.</p>
