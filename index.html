          <p>Jamie Borthwick, known for his role in EastEnders, has been suspended by the BBC after using a derogatory term for people with disabilities during the filming of 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The incident occurred backstage at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom, where Borthwick reportedly used the slur to describe the people of the seaside town. Borthwick issued a statement apologizing for his language, stating that he did not fully understand the term's meaning and is now deeply embarrassed by his actions. Disability charity Scope has urged Borthwick to educate himself on the realities of disabled people's lives. The BBC has deemed his language 'entirely unacceptable' and not reflective of their values.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, has taken her first flight from the nest, joining her sister Sunny. The eaglet's flight occurred around 8:27 a.m. local time after practicing wing flapping and jumping between branches. Sunny had taken her first flight a few days prior. Both eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old. Young eagles typically return to the nest soon after their first flight and will remain in the habitat for one to three months before venturing out on their own.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that his relationship with Elon Musk is over after the tech billionaire criticized the president's tax and spending bill. Trump said Musk had been "disrespectful to the office of the president." The fallout occurred after weeks of Musk criticizing Trump's legislation, which Musk claimed would increase the national deficit. Musk had previously donated millions to Trump's election campaign and served as a White House aide. Trump suggested Musk would face "serious consequences" if he backed Democratic candidates.</p>

While this series provided a positive start, tougher tests lie ahead, including a series against India and the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. England has historically dominated home bilateral series but struggled on the big stage. The key question is whether the "new" England can perform under pressure when it matters most.
