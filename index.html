          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a tight 50-49 vote. The confirmation proceeded despite significant controversy and opposition from Democrats, former judges, and prosecutors. Allegations from multiple whistleblowers claimed Bove engaged in professional misconduct, including suggesting that Justice Department lawyers should defy court orders and executing politically motivated firings. Supporters praised his legal background and qualifications, while opponents walked out of the committee vote in protest, citing the serious nature of the accusations against him.</p>

          <p>Police in Norwood, Massachusetts, have arrested six women from Maryland, alleging they are part of an organized criminal group responsible for burglaries across multiple states. The arrests followed a home break-in where the homeowners confronted the intruders, leading to a brief car chase and a foot pursuit. Authorities discovered the women were all related and that several had outstanding warrants for similar crimes in other jurisdictions. Following their arraignment, three of the women were released on bail and immediately taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), highlighting an immigration dimension to the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>Sufferers of oniomania, or shopping addiction, are advocating for the condition to be taken more seriously by the public and the UK's National Health Service. The article profiles several individuals, including one who accumulated £12,000 in debt buying clothes and another who hoards thousands of household items, highlighting the severe financial and emotional toll. Experts note that online shopping and social media influencers have exacerbated the problem, which some studies suggest may affect up to 10% of adults. Those affected feel that resources are lacking and that shopping addiction should receive the same level of recognition and therapeutic support as substance addictions.</p>

          <p>Beijing has strongly criticized Japan's new space defense guidelines, accusing Tokyo and its Western allies of using defense as a pretext to develop and deploy space-based weapons. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated that such measures threaten the security of outer space and raise concerns about a revival of militarism in the region. The Japanese guidelines had explicitly mentioned that countries like China and Russia are actively developing technologies to disable other nations' satellites, turning space into a combat domain. This diplomatic clash occurs as Japan and the United States increase their cooperation on space-based surveillance and intelligence sharing.</p>

          <p>Australia's annual inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below economists' expectations. This places the rate just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range of 2-3%, strengthening the case for a potential interest rate cut. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which offset price rises in housing and food. While the RBA has held its policy rate at 3.85%, analysts now anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the next meeting, especially given a weaker global growth outlook and a rising domestic unemployment rate.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a proposal to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as "the largest deregulatory action in the history of America," claiming it would save Americans $54 billion annually. If finalized, the repeal would eliminate regulations on emissions from vehicles and other sources, a move environmental groups and scientists have called "criminal negligence." Critics argue this action ignores overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change and its devastating impacts, and they have vowed to challenge the decision in court.</p>

The culled baboons were subsequently fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights groups have condemned the action as "avoidable and illegal," filing a criminal complaint and arguing the zoo's "irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies" were to blame for the situation, which they say did not constitute a valid reason for killing healthy animals.</p>

          <p>A recent American Eagle ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has ignited a culture war, illustrating the fractured nature of modern online discourse. The ad's pun on "jeans" and "genes" was interpreted by some progressives as a dog whistle for eugenics, sparking outrage, while right-wing commentators used the reaction to portray their opponents as hysterical. This article argues the incident is a textbook example of how legitimate concerns, such as the rise of white supremacist rhetoric, are warped by an information ecosystem designed for outrage, not conversation. The controversy becomes algorithmic grist, where every faction exploits the moment for content, clicks, and moral posturing.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that the United Kingdom will formally recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza. This policy shift is conditioned on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire, allowing unimpeded UN aid into the territory, and committing to no new annexations in the West Bank. The move aligns the UK with France's recent announcement and increases international pressure on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the announcement, stating that it "rewards Hamas' monstrous terrorism" and undermines efforts to secure a hostage release.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of economists and fund managers indicates a tight three-way race for the next Federal Reserve chair, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and economic advisor Kevin Hassett seen as the leading candidates. The survey reflects expectations that President Trump will replace current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Respondents believe the president's public pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates is actually making cuts less likely in the short term. The survey also forecasts two rate cuts by the end of the year, bringing the federal funds rate to around 3.9%. (not investment advice)</p>

The resolution recognizes the task force's vital work and calls for it to continue without political disruption.

In a note found by police, 27-year-old Shane Tamura, a former high school football player, requested his brain be studied for the disease and blamed the NFL for concealing its dangers. While he never played professionally, the incident brings renewed attention to CTE, which can cause violent mood swings and other neurological issues.

Tasmanian devils are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials and are known for their powerful bite and noisy feeding habits. The species is classified as endangered, primarily due to a contagious and fatal cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease, making their presence in conservation programs like the one at the L.A.

His family stated they were unaware of the risks of swimming in the lake where he was exposed and do not want his death to be in vain. Health officials advise people to hold their nose or use nose clips when swimming in warm freshwater, as the infection is almost always fatal but also highly preventable.</p>

While supervisors argue the practice is intimidating and a violation of civil rights, the county's ability to enforce such a ban on federal agents is legally questionable.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to repeal the EPA's "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases is a major blow to federal climate policy, but it may strengthen California's role as a regulatory leader. The finding is the legal basis for many federal emissions rules, and its reversal could undo them. However, experts note that California has its own robust state-level climate laws, such as its ban on new gas-powered cars by 2035, that predate and are independent of the federal finding. Legal analysts suggest that by ceding federal authority, the administration might unintentionally open the door for California to expand its own regulations.</p>

A new development company, Platform4, will be created to manage the projects.

Talks broke down last week, leading to the first strike under the new government, with both sides exchanging sharp criticism. With the strike concluding, there are signs of a potential return to negotiations, focusing on non-pay issues like exam fees and working conditions, though the core issue of pay remains a significant hurdle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are warning that air travel is becoming bumpier as climate change alters atmospheric conditions, leading to more frequent and intense turbulence. A study from the University of Reading projects a potential doubling or tripling of severe turbulence in the coming decades. This is caused by a warmer atmosphere creating more powerful thunderstorms (convective turbulence) and strengthening the jet stream (clear-air turbulence). While deaths from turbulence are extremely rare, injuries are more common, and the trend could lead to increased costs for airlines and greater anxiety for passengers, reinforcing the importance of keeping seatbelts fastened whenever seated.</p>
