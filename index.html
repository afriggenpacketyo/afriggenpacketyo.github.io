          <p>Energy secretary Ed Miliband is evaluating a proposal for regional energy pricing that could lead to lower bills in areas with more energy production. The "zonal pricing" scheme aims to enhance the efficiency of the national energy grid and encourage investment, but it has sparked debate among energy companies. Some support the idea, arguing it could reduce the need for network upgrades, while others fear it could deter investment and raise bills for some households. Miliband emphasized that no decision has been made and that the primary goal is to lower bills across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of investing in companies involved in mining and processing critical minerals to reduce U.S. reliance on imports from countries like China. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested using a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners, citing China's practice of dumping minerals on international markets. The administration is also considering a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies investing in approved projects from political changes. These initiatives aim to bolster domestic mining capabilities and ensure a stable supply of critical minerals for key industries, including defense, energy, and automobiles.</p>

          <p>China refuted claims made by President Trump about ongoing negotiations regarding tariffs, stating that the U.S. should first remove its unilateral tariffs. This comes amid escalating trade tensions between the two nations, with both countries imposing multiple rounds of import duties. China maintains that any discussions must be based on mutual respect and equality, and that the cancellation of all existing tariffs is a prerequisite for meaningful talks. Despite Trump's indication of a willingness to be "very nice" to President Xi Jinping, China has vowed to "fight to the end" and has taken retaliatory economic measures.</p>

          <p>The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has filed a complaint with Ofcom regarding a BBC Panorama episode about the shooting of Chris Kaba. The IOPC alleges that the program initially aired without including the watchdog's statement in response to claims made by a former regional director. The IOPC is seeking a public apology from the BBC, claiming the program caused serious reputational damage. The BBC maintains that the complaint has been resolved after amending the iPlayer version and online article to include the IOPC's statement.</p>

          <p>Vehicles trapped in a mechanical stacked car park in central London are set to be released after more than two years. Owners are being given time slots to retrieve their vehicles, which have been stuck since December 2022 due to a malfunction. The saga has left owners significantly out of pocket, with concerns about the condition of the vehicles after prolonged storage. This situation highlights the potential risks associated with automated parking systems and the importance of clear communication and accountability from management companies.</p>
