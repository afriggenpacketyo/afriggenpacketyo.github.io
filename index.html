          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has signaled its readiness to engage in discussions with other countries regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for various industries, including robotics and new energy vehicles. The ministry emphasized that it has already approved qualified export applications, taking into account the legitimate needs of other nations and adhering to established laws. China is open to enhancing communication to facilitate compliant trade, especially as rare earths remain a key element in trade negotiations with the United States, with Vice-Premier He Lifeng expected to attend upcoming meetings to address these issues. This move reflects China's approach as a responsible major power, balancing domestic interests with global demand. </p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, currently the United States head coach, has stated that a return to Tottenham Hotspur is "not realistic" at this time, following the club's decision to sack Ange Postecoglou. Pochettino, who previously managed Tottenham for five years, emphasized his commitment to his current role with the US national team. Postecoglou's departure came despite leading the club to their first trophy in 17 years, creating speculation about potential replacements. Pochettino's remarks clarify his immediate future and dampen speculation about a return to his former club. </p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to escalating protests following recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and unnecessary, stating that local authorities are capable of managing the situation. The deployment involves at least 2,000 National Guard troops under Title 10 authority, bypassing the usual consultation with the state governor. Protests have erupted after ICE conducted raids across the city, resulting in numerous arrests and sparking widespread demonstrations, with clashes between protesters and authorities. </p>

Shohei Ohtani extended his hit streak, but the Cardinals managed to break the scoreless tie late in the game, securing the win with a single in the bottom of the ninth.

The government is attempting to improve teaching retention rates as well, but has missed recruitment targets for trainee teachers for both primary and secondary schools for the ninth time in 10 years. Another teacher, Sam Alner, shares the difficulties of the job and the importance of work-life balance, which leads to many leaving the profession. </p>

Critics argue that this move will fuel a global nuclear arms race and increase the risk of tactical nuclear weapons deployment. The decision contradicts the spirit of the non-proliferation treaty and could signal a dangerous shift towards normalizing nuclear warfare, diverting resources from essential public services. The review concedes the NPT is close to failing. </p>

Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "sowing chaos" and escalating tensions unnecessarily, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines.

Lawyers believe there is evidence that Israel followed war crimes, committed by Hamas when it attacked Israel, with very many of its own, including the crime of genocide.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, which has restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrates how tellurium nanowire implants can be used in a biocompatible device to restore vision and enable the perception of “invisible” light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, acting as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advance offers significant promise for treating human blindness. </p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco cards are not acceptable forms of identification for boarding domestic flights, emphasizing that travelers need REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs. The agency humorously addressed the confusion on Facebook, noting that while they appreciate Costco's hotdogs and rotisserie chickens, the membership cards do not meet REAL ID requirements. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, sets standards for identification sources, and all states now issue REAL ID-compliant cards, which typically feature a star marking their compliance.

          <h2>China Explores Male Childcare Subsidies to Address Demographic Crisis</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, offering a potential solution to China's demographic challenges. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, prompting authorities to seek effective measures to boost birth rates. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women, clashing with rapid economic changes. </p>

Introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, Docomo's emoji gained massive popularity in Japan before spreading globally. The company's new Android smartphones and feature phones will adopt Google's Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead, recognizing the widespread adoption of these alternatives. The Docomo emoji set, which was added to the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016, played a significant role in humanizing electronic communication. </p>
