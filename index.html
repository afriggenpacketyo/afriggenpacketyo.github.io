          <p>Former President Trump has condemned an appeals court decision that temporarily blocked a land transfer required for the development of the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona. The project, a joint venture between mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, faces strong opposition from groups including the San Carlos Apache Tribe due to religious, cultural, and environmental concerns. Trump labeled the opposition as "Anti-American," emphasizing the nation's need for copper and the potential for job creation. This legal setback highlights the ongoing conflict between major industrial projects and the protection of sacred indigenous lands and natural resources.</p>

          <p>Brentford has rejected an improved bid of £40 million from Newcastle for striker Yoane Wissa, deeming the offer below their valuation of the player. The proposed deal included a £35 million initial fee with an additional £5 million in add-ons. Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season, has reportedly expressed his desire to join Newcastle and held talks with Brentford's owner. The rejection marks the second time Newcastle's offer for the 28-year-old forward has been turned down, leaving his future at the club uncertain as discussions continue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, as announced by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The administration accused the individuals of politicizing intelligence and other detrimental conduct but did not provide specific evidence to support the claims. Many of the targeted officials have been critical of former President Trump or were involved in the intelligence assessment of Russia's 2016 election interference. Critics argue the move is a retaliatory tactic that could suppress dissenting views within the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has demanded the resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, following allegations of mortgage fraud leveled by Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a criminal investigation, accusing Cook of falsifying documents to secure more favorable loan terms on properties in Michigan and Georgia. This development expands the Trump administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve and its officials, with Pulte also suggesting that Fed Chair Jerome Powell could be seen as complicit if he fails to investigate.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 2 storm, is moving north in the Atlantic, prompting evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks. While the hurricane is not expected to make a direct landfall in the U.S., its large size is generating dangerous conditions, including coastal flooding, strong winds, and life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast. Officials have issued tropical storm warnings for coastal North Carolina and Virginia and have urged residents in evacuation zones to act immediately. The storm is the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season.</p>

          <p>A recent financial analysis highlights the significant returns savers can achieve by investing in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current economic climate. Despite rates having cooled from their recent peaks, they remain high enough to generate substantial interest on a large deposit like $125,000. The article breaks down the expected earnings across various terms, from a 3-month CD yielding over $1,300 to a 5-year CD generating nearly $30,000 in interest.

          <p>The Trump administration has yet to resume student loan forgiveness under the popular Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan after pausing it earlier this summer. Lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders, are urging the Department of Education to restart the debt cancellation, stating that the delay is harming families who are legally entitled to relief. The pause was initiated to adjust payment counts following court actions that blocked the Biden-era SAVE plan. While the department has stated discharges will resume once correct counts are established, the continued freeze is causing uncertainty for borrowers nearing their forgiveness timeline.</p>

The rationale is that the black paint will absorb heat, making the wall significantly hotter and more difficult for migrants to climb, especially in high temperatures. This initiative is part of a broader immigration crackdown that includes accelerated wall construction, with about half a mile being built daily. The administration claims that its policies of increased border security and mass deportations have led to a dramatic reduction in border crossings.</p>

While lower rates provide some relief, the high cost of entry into the housing market continues to be the primary barrier. According to a recent survey, a significant portion of prospective buyers are waiting for both prices and rates to fall further before they feel comfortable purchasing a home.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are scheduled for long-awaited parole hearings this week. The hearings come after a judge resentenced them in May to 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole. The brothers, who have maintained they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, have taken full accountability and expressed remorse for their crimes. While their family is cautiously optimistic, the final decision on their release will ultimately rest with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who can approve, deny, or modify the parole board's recommendation.</p>

          <p>This article provides a brief overview of how Attorney General Pam Bondi has significantly reshaped the Department of Justice under the Trump administration. According to The New Yorker's Ruth Marcus, Bondi has overseen a highly convulsive transition, marked by aggressive policy reversals, investigations into political adversaries of former President Trump, and the dismissal of staff. Her tenure is characterized as a period of profound change, aligning the department's priorities and actions more closely with the administration's political agenda. The changes are described as some of the most dramatic since the Watergate era.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it is calling up approximately 60,000 reservists in preparation for a major ground offensive aimed at capturing all of Gaza City. The plan, approved by the defense minister, is expected to involve ordering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians to evacuate to southern Gaza. This move comes after ceasefire negotiations with Hamas broke down and has drawn condemnation from international allies, including France, who warned it could lead to a humanitarian disaster. The International Committee of the Red Cross also stated that the offensive risks worsening an already catastrophic situation for Gaza's population.</p>

          <p>Following a recent $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank, Intel is reportedly in discussions with other major investors for another equity infusion at a discounted price. The chipmaker is navigating a challenging turnaround period, facing declining sales and struggling to compete in the advanced AI semiconductor market.

          <p>A group of Western countries, including France, Britain, Canada, and Australia, are preparing to formally recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming UN General Assembly. This move is a significant diplomatic step intended to bolster the two-state solution, even without an active peace process. The recognition is seen as a way to support the diplomatic efforts of the Palestine Liberation Organization over the armed struggle of Hamas. It also serves as a rebuke to Israel's expansionist policies in the West Bank, sending a clear message against further annexation of territory considered essential for a future Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of U.S. adults report drinking alcohol, the lowest figure in the survey's nearly 90-year history. This decline coincides with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health, a sharp increase from 28% in 2015. The trend is most pronounced among young adults, who are increasingly viewing alcohol as a health risk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could lead to lower monthly payments. Since HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a cut in the federal funds rate usually results in a corresponding drop in the HELOC rate. However, the timing of payment relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule and the loan's billing cycle. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan terms and budget for potential rate fluctuations in either direction to manage their debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

After recent meetings with both leaders, Trump suggested a bilateral meeting could be beneficial but acknowledged Putin might not be interested in a deal. Russian officials have stated that any high-level meeting would require extensive preparation at lower levels first, a familiar line that often signals reluctance. This diplomatic maneuvering occurs as Russian attacks continue in Ukraine, including recent strikes in Odesa and Sumy.</p>
