          <p>The Supreme Court justices seemed inclined to support parents seeking religious exemptions from school materials, specifically regarding LGBTQ+ themed books in Montgomery County, Maryland elementary schools. The court's conservative majority questioned the school district's decision to eliminate an opt-out policy for such materials, raising concerns about parental rights and religious freedom. Justices considered the balance between inclusivity and accommodating diverse religious beliefs, with some expressing skepticism about the content being presented to young children. The case highlights the ongoing tension between religious liberty and public education standards, with a ruling expected by late June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The resumption of student loan collections by the Trump administration is raising concerns among economists about its potential impact on the U.S. economy. Roughly 5 million borrowers with defaulted loans will face collections, potentially reducing consumer spending and damaging credit scores. While the policy aims to increase government revenue, experts warn it could exacerbate economic challenges at a time when the U.S. faces recession risks. However, some argue that the policy provides clarity after years of uncertainty surrounding loan forgiveness.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price rebounded, surpassing $90,000 for the first time since March, as investors sought refuge in the cryptocurrency amid stock market instability and a weakening dollar. The surge coincided with renewed pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Bitcoin's recent decoupling from traditional risk assets, like equities, suggests a growing perception of it as an alternative investment. While some analysts note light trading volumes, long-term holders and strategic buying are providing support for further resilience against market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jose Morales was convicted of murder and evidence tampering in the 2019 death of Christine Holloway, his girlfriend, in Ansonia, Connecticut. Morales claimed intruders were responsible for Holloway's death and the kidnapping of their 14-month-old daughter, Vanessa, who remains missing. Prosecutors successfully argued that Morales' account did not align with the evidence found at the crime scene, including his attempts to clean the apartment and dispose of blood-soaked items.

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a significant reorganization of the U.S. State Department, aiming to reduce staff by 15% and streamline operations. The plan involves eliminating over 100 bureaus and offices worldwide, including the Office of Global Women's Issues, with the goal of increasing efficiency and aligning the department's focus with U.S. national interests. Critics worry about the impact on diversity and inclusion efforts, while supporters argue the changes will empower regional bureaus and remove redundancies.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's tariffs pose a significant threat to the global economy, potentially triggering a trade war. The IMF lowered its global growth forecast for the year, citing increased policy uncertainty and trade tensions. The organization also reduced its outlook for U.S. growth, acknowledging the unpredictable economic environment created by Trump's trade policies.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Chinese citizens are employed at a drone production facility in Russia, suggesting Russia may have acquired drone technology from China. These allegations follow Zelensky's previous claim that China is supplying weapons and gunpowder to Russia, which China denies. By suggesting the drone technology transfer might have occurred without Beijing's knowledge, Zelensky appeared to soften his stance toward China. Zelensky also mentioned Russia's recruitment of Chinese nationals to fight in its armed forces.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. Economists are skeptical about the feasibility of this proposal, arguing that it is not realistic. Tariff negotiations are ongoing, with a temporary pause on sweeping tariffs enacted earlier in April, and tariffs on Chinese goods remain high. Changes to the income tax would require Congressional legislation.</p>
