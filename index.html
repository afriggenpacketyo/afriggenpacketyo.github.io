          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress and the president continue to receive their salaries due to constitutional provisions and permanent appropriations that are not affected by annual funding lapses. Lawmakers' pay, set at $174,000 for most members, is funded by a permanent appropriation established in 1983. In contrast, hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including many congressional staffers, are either furloughed or required to work without immediate pay, receiving back pay only after the shutdown concludes.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Heritage Foundation argues that the United States' current nuclear arsenal is dangerously outdated and insufficient to deter growing threats from China and Russia. The report recommends a significant expansion, suggesting the U.S. should increase its number of deployed nuclear weapons from approximately 1,750 to around 4,625 by the year 2050. This proposed modernization aims to achieve strategic parity with adversaries who are rapidly expanding their own nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Shares of Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, surged over 20% following its announcement of a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders. This change could potentially bypass credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose stock prices fell on the news. The new model aims to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and give lenders more choice, a move praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director as a creative solution for consumers.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia will respond swiftly if provoked by Europe, which he accused of fueling hysteria and militarization. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group, Putin dismissed the idea of an attack on a NATO member as unbelievable and told European leaders to focus on their own domestic issues. He asserted that any countermeasures from Russia would not be long in coming if Moscow feels its interests are threatened by European actions.</p>

          <p>Sarah Jessica Parker has reflected on the decision to conclude the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," stating it was a respectful choice to end the series while it was still feeling right and energetic. While suggesting a return isn't entirely out of the question, she is also focusing on her book imprint, SJP Lit. Parker highlighted her latest book club selection, "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 17th-century Amsterdam.</p>

          <p>The emergence of 'Tilly Norwood,' a computer-generated actor, has intensified anxiety within Hollywood over the use of artificial intelligence. Created by a London-based AI studio, the digital character has an active social media presence and is reportedly close to signing with a talent agency. The actors' union SAG-AFTRA condemned the creation, stating it was trained on the uncompensated work of human performers and threatens their livelihoods, while many actors have called the development terrifying and misguided.</p>

          <p>The Premier League is considering replacing its current Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which limit club losses to £105 million over three years, with an alternative system. Chief Executive Richard Masters confirmed that discussions are underway with clubs about adopting a squad cost ratio (SCR) model, similar to UEFA's regulations. This new system would allow clubs to spend a set percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs, potentially offering more flexibility for investment while maintaining financial control.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that experts attribute more to contentment than overt joy. The ranking is based on citizens' evaluation of their lives, which is bolstered by a strong social safety net, high levels of trust in institutions, and accessible public services like libraries and saunas. Finns' deep connection to nature and a societal emphasis on work-life balance also contribute significantly to their overall sense of well-being.</p>

The gaffe occurred while she was defending her party's record on Brexit and its impact on the union, including the controversial post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>A sustained two-month campaign of Ukrainian drone strikes has hit at least 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries, causing a significant domestic fuel crisis. The attacks have idled nearly 40% of Russia's primary refining capacity, leading to a 50% surge in wholesale gasoline prices and widespread fuel shortages, particularly in occupied Crimea. This campaign brings the economic consequences of the war directly to the Russian public, challenging the Kremlin's narrative that the conflict does not affect everyday life.</p>

          <p>Disney's brand sentiment has fallen to multi-year lows among both Democrats and Republicans following its handling of a controversy involving late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. The company briefly pulled Kimmel's show after his comments about a slain conservative activist, a move that alienated viewers across the political spectrum and drew criticism for caving to political pressure. According to an analysis by Jefferies, the public relations damage was compounded by a recent price hike for the Disney+ streaming service.</p>
