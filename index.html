          <p>A significant cyberattack has targeted Collins Aerospace, a key software provider for the aviation industry, causing widespread disruptions at several major European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's Muse software, which manages check-in and baggage systems, has forced airlines to revert to manual processing, leading to long queues and hundreds of flight delays. While the company is actively working to resolve the issue, the incident highlights the vulnerability of interconnected global travel systems to digital threats, affecting thousands of passengers.</p>

Army leaders emphasize the need for cheap, fast, and automated systems to defend against drone swarms, which are considered nearly impossible for humans to handle alone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An ongoing and severe drought across Vermont is placing immense strain on the state's dairy farmers, who are central to the local economy. The dry conditions have stunted the growth of essential feed crops like corn and alfalfa, forcing farmers to spend thousands on supplemental feed and, in some cases, haul water for their cattle. With much of the state in a severe or extreme drought and soil moisture far below average, farmers are facing significant financial losses. Government assistance may still be weeks away, compelling farmers to adapt to increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested five North American citizens and a local farm caretaker after discovering a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg. Acting on a tip about a strange chemical smell, authorities raided the property and seized approximately $20 million worth of crystal meth, along with precursor chemicals and manufacturing equipment. The five foreign suspects, who were in the country illegally, attempted to flee but were apprehended. The operation is being hailed by local law enforcement as a significant step in combating the region's drug trade.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed establishing emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the country's significant asylum application backlog and reduce reliance on costly hotels for housing applicants. The plan, modeled after the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be coupled with an increase in the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions. Speaking at the party's annual conference, home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued this approach would be more humane for asylum seekers and more cost-effective for taxpayers. The party is also advocating for increased police visibility in community spaces.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's bustling Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents. Police confirmed the ordnance dated back to the war, when Allied forces conducted air raids on the then Japanese-occupied city. An extensive operation to defuse the nearly five-foot-long bomb began late Friday and concluded successfully on Saturday morning without any injuries. The discovery is one of several recent instances across the globe where unexploded WWII munitions have been found during construction work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's commitment to free speech is being scrutinized following comments from FCC director Brendan Carr, who suggested President Trump's election created a new "permission structure" for the media. Carr has threatened to use regulatory power against programs like "The View," prompting criticism even from some Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz, who likened the tactics to intimidation. This shift has caused confusion among some of the administration's allies, who previously championed an anti-cancel-culture stance. The article suggests this pivot away from established free speech principles could alienate parts of the MAGA coalition and the broader public.</p>

          <p>Personal finance expert Jaspreet Singh offers a five-point strategy for individuals to save, invest, and build wealth from their paychecks, addressing the fact that nearly half of Americans spend their entire monthly income. He recommends systemizing money into three separate accounts for spending (75%), investing (15%), and saving (10%) to create a disciplined financial habit. Other key steps include strategically asking for a raise by demonstrating value to an employer and being intelligent about managing and paying down debt.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire skilled foreign workers. The administration cited a need to prevent "abuse" of the program, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stating that companies must now decide if a foreign worker is valuable enough to justify the high cost or if they should hire an American instead.

The 2024 results show a significant decline, with 45% of seniors scoring below the "basic" level in math, continuing a downward trend that experts say began before the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors cited for the decline include chronic absenteeism, increased screen time, and reduced time spent with longer texts.

As federal agencies, historically a stable pathway to the middle class for this demographic, face significant cuts, nearly 300,000 Black women have exited the U.S. labor force in just three months. The article highlights the psychological toll on those who remain, who face a climate of fear and instability that discourages self-advocacy.

          <p>To determine if a car purchase is affordable, financial experts recommend following the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to manage costs effectively. This framework suggests making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car with a loan term no longer than four years, and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your income. Adhering to these principles helps lower overall interest payments, prevents becoming "underwater" on the loan, and ensures that the depreciating asset does not compromise long-term financial goals like retirement savings.

          <p>This opinion article draws parallels between the 1933 Reichstag fire in Germany, which the Nazis used as a pretext to crush opposition and suspend civil liberties, and the current political environment in the United States following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The author argues that the Trump administration is similarly using the tragedy to justify a massive repression of political opponents, labeling the left as responsible without evidence. While acknowledging key differences between Weimar Germany and modern America, the piece warns that the administration's actions represent an unprecedented assault on democratic norms that requires widespread popular resistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the rapid formation of a narrative within some progressive circles that the killer of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was a far-right extremist. The author points out that this theory, which gained traction on social media and was even alluded to by host Jimmy Kimmel, lacked a solid factual basis from the start. Recently filed charging documents now suggest the opposite, indicating the suspect's motives were aligned with left-leaning views. The piece argues that this episode illustrates a universal human tendency to favor ideologically convenient fictions and serves as a caution for progressives to guard against their own biases.</p>

          <p>Analyst Dan Wang proposes a new framework for understanding U.S.-China dynamics, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that China's leadership, dominated by engineers, has excelled at physical dynamism—building infrastructure, expanding mass transit, and maintaining a robust manufacturing base. In contrast, he suggests the U.S., governed by lawyers, appears physically stagnant and could learn from China's successes in these areas. While acknowledging China's own significant problems, such as high youth unemployment caused by crackdowns on service industries, Wang's analysis challenges conventional views on national development and competition.</p>

          <p>Estonia has invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty to request urgent consultations with allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. This marks the fifth such violation by Russia this year and follows recent incursions into Polish and Romanian airspace, escalating regional tensions. NATO scrambled jets from Italy, Finland, and Sweden to intercept and escort the Russian aircraft, which were flying without transponders or flight plans. The incident highlights a pattern of Russian provocations designed to test the alliance's defenses and has prompted calls for a stronger, more unified response.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently located hundreds of miles from land, the storm is tracking northwest and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday while remaining over open water. While no immediate land threats have been issued, its projected path could bring it east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify. The formation of Gabrielle comes after a relatively quiet period in what was initially predicted to be a busier-than-usual hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched a widespread missile and drone assault across nine regions of Ukraine, killing at least three people and injuring dozens more. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the attacks deliberately targeted infrastructure and civilian areas, including an apartment building in Dnipro struck by a missile with cluster munitions. Ukraine's Air Force reported that it successfully intercepted the majority of the more than 600 projectiles launched, crediting the effectiveness of Western-supplied air defense systems and F-16 fighter jets. The attack represents a continued strategy by Russia to intimidate civilians and degrade Ukrainian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers, cementing his legacy as one of the franchise's all-time greats. The article reflects on his role as a constant pillar of excellence during some of the organization's most turbulent times, including a bankruptcy and a 20-year postseason series win drought. Kershaw's consistent dominance, which includes three Cy Young Awards and a World Series championship, was central to the team's revival into a perennial contender.

          <p>Following the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration has intensified its rhetoric against non-profit organizations, particularly those involved in immigrant advocacy. Top aides like Stephen Miller have vowed to hold groups "criminally liable" for what they baselessly describe as coordinated attacks, and ICE has warned that filming its operations could be considered a threat. In response, immigrant rights organizations are bracing for a crackdown, advising staff on safety while reaffirming their commitment to legally observe and document immigration enforcement actions. The threats are seen as an attempt to create an atmosphere of fear and curtail free speech.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing the Trump administration of using the recent killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext to launch a campaign of vengeance against political opponents. The administration has escalated threats against what it terms the "radical left," considering the classification of some groups as domestic terrorists despite no evidence linking them to the crime. This response is seen by some political scientists as a classic authoritarian tactic: exploiting a tragedy to justify a crackdown on dissent, undermine the opposition party, and erode civil liberties. The rhetoric has intensified ahead of a memorial service for Kirk, where President Trump is expected to speak.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County cost-cutting plan proposes the elimination of the Sybil Brand Commission, an oversight body that has exposed substandard jail conditions for decades. The move, which would save approximately $40,000 annually, comes at a time when in-custody deaths are on track to reach a 20-year high. The commission's findings have been crucial in legal actions against the county, including a recent state lawsuit over the "humanitarian crisis" in its jails. Critics and commissioners argue that dissolving the body is a shortsighted measure that will reduce vital, independent oversight of the sheriff's department.</p>

          <p>A powerful anti-corruption movement, largely organized and led by Gen Z activists, has resulted in the overthrow of Nepal's government in less than 48 hours. Protests erupted after the government suspended social media platforms that activists were using to expose the lavish lifestyles of politicians' families. The ensuing violence led to the prime minister's resignation and the appointment of Sushila Karki, the country's first female chief justice, as its first female prime minister. This dramatic upheaval reflects a broader trend of youth-driven frustration with corruption and economic hardship across South Asia.</p>
