          <p>A massive 54-pound meteorite originating from Mars is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's, with an estimated value of up to $4 million. The meteorite, known as NWA 16788, is the largest piece of Mars currently on Earth and represents a significant portion of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara Desert. Scientists and collectors alike view the object as not just a rare artifact but also a valuable dataset for understanding the Red Planet.</p>

          <p>Tensions escalated into physical confrontations between federal agents and protesters during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a farm in Ventura County, California. Video footage showed agents, who were masked, using crowd control measures and detaining at least one individual. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement actions in the region, which has included other raids and a significant military presence in Los Angeles. These operations follow President Trump's directive for a large-scale mass deportation program, prompting fear and protest in local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy a 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, effective August 1. In a public letter, President Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs as the reason for the new measure, also linking the decision to the flow of fentanyl into the United States. The announcement states that these tariffs are separate from existing sectoral duties and warns that the rate could increase if Canada escalates its own tariffs in response. This move signals a significant escalation in trade tensions between the two neighboring countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a key student negotiator during the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration for wrongful detention. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was held by ICE for over three months as the administration sought his deportation on foreign policy grounds, a move his lawyers call retaliatory for his protected speech. The claim alleges false arrest, malicious prosecution, and emotional distress, stating the administration falsely labeled him a terrorist sympathizer. Khalil has offered to drop the monetary claim in exchange for an official apology and a policy reversal.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing negotiations and meetings between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the war in Gaza continues with no ceasefire agreement yet reached. A recent Israeli military strike in central Gaza resulted in the deaths of 15 civilians, including 10 children, who were waiting for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic run by the U.S. charity Project HOPE. The organization condemned the attack as a violation of international humanitarian law. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted a terrorist but expressed regret for any harm to civilians and is investigating the incident.</p>

The letter to Brazil's president also incorrectly claims the U.S. has a trade deficit with the country, when it actually has a surplus.

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris suffered a superficial eye injury during a fireworks accident over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. According to his agent, the injury was minor, and the prominent free-agent signing is expected to be fully recovered and ready for the upcoming NFL season. The confirmation came after online speculation suggested a more severe injury. Harris, who has four consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons, is anticipated to be a key player in the Chargers' offense as they aim for a return to the playoffs this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, a trend that climate scientists attribute directly to human-induced global warming. Following the UK's warmest spring on record, June 2025 became England's warmest month ever recorded. Scientists warn that even a small rise in global average temperature translates to significantly hotter heatwaves, with UK events being 3-4°C warmer than they would be otherwise. This pattern is becoming a regular feature of British summers, shifting what was once a rare event like the 1976 heatwave into a more common occurrence driven by a warming climate.</p>

However, the NHS trust stated its own audit found his outcomes to be within the normal range. The article details the case of one NHS patient who claims she suffered for years from a surgical error he made, raising serious questions about oversight and patient safety across public and private healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This trend is attributed to a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples delay parenthood due to social and financial pressures and later turn to treatments like IVF. The government is expanding subsidies for these procedures to combat the demographic crisis. While the high costs and workplace pressures remain significant barriers, the demand for fertility services suggests a persistent desire for children among many South Koreans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six staff members following an internal review that found an "operational failure" led to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in July 2024. A gunman was able to fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, grazing Trump's ear and killing an attendee before being shot dead. The agency, which has faced intense congressional scrutiny, confirmed the suspensions and stated it is implementing reforms to prevent future incidents. These changes include using military-grade drones, improving command posts, and creating a new division dedicated to aerial security to address the identified lapses.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate faster than the overall pace of global warming. The findings indicate that even small increments of warming will disproportionately lengthen the most extreme and rare heat waves, posing a significant risk to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure. The research highlights that the longest heat waves are showing the greatest increases in frequency, a trend that will be most severe in tropical regions. Scientists warn that adaptation strategies must accelerate to keep pace with these rapidly changing climate extremes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the Trump administration announced that undocumented children will be excluded from the federal preschool program, Head Start. This move is part of a broader strategy to reclassify various federal programs as "public benefits" to restrict access for non-citizens. Head Start provides early childhood education, nutrition, and childcare for low-income families, and advocates warn the change will create fear and confusion among all immigrant families, not just those directly affected. The policy is seen as an effort to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants and pressure them to self-deport.</p>

In exchange for returning some migrants, the UK will accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers from France.
