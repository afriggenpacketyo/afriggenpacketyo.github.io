          <p>President Trump and South African President Ramaphosa engaged in a heated discussion regarding allegations of "White genocide" in South Africa during a White House meeting that also included Elon Musk. Ramaphosa refuted Trump's claims, stating that crime affects all demographics in South Africa, not just White farmers. Trump responded by showing a video depicting violence against White South Africans, which Ramaphosa dismissed as unrepresentative of government policy. The meeting aimed to reset relations between the two countries, but the tense exchange highlighted significant disagreements, with Ramaphosa's spokesperson calling Trump's presentation "noise" and "an absolute lie".</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from an Orleans Parish jail, triggering a large-scale manhunt involving over 200 law enforcement officers. The escape occurred after an inmate allegedly coerced a maintenance worker to shut off the water supply to a cell, facilitating the removal of a sink-toilet unit and subsequent breach through a wall. The inmates then fled through a loading dock and across Interstate 10 before the disappearance was discovered during a routine head count hours later. Five inmates have been captured, while five remain at large, with investigations underway regarding potential staff negligence and facility security failures.</p>

          <p>As Israel's war in Gaza continues, increasing dissent within Israel is emerging regarding the war's conduct. Former Israeli officials have voiced strong criticism, with one describing Israel as becoming a "pariah state" and another stating current government policy is leading to destruction. Recent polls indicate that a majority of Israelis favor ending the war to secure the return of hostages, while a smaller percentage supports expanding the conflict. This shift in public sentiment reflects growing despair and trauma amidst the ongoing violence and limited aid reaching Gaza.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing legislation that could trigger international tax and trade conflicts by penalizing foreign companies from countries implementing a global minimum tax. The bill would increase taxes on companies based in nations that enforce the 2021 global tax agreement, potentially straining relationships between the U.S. and other countries. This issue is expected to be discussed at the upcoming G7 finance ministers' meeting, with concerns raised about potential retaliatory measures and the impact on foreign investment. The legislation aims to undermine the 2021 tax deal, which sought to establish a 15 percent global minimum tax rate.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are progressing with a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion law, which only allows abortions to save the mother's life. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While not expanding abortion access or including exceptions for rape or incest, the proposal represents a shift for Texas Republicans. Critics question the bill's impact, while supporters aim to avoid confusion among doctors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Ramaphosa took a confrontational turn as Trump accused the South African government of seizing land from white farmers. However, Trump's accusations are undermined by his own administration's use of eminent domain to seize land for the border wall. This hypocrisy is exemplified by the case of Richard Drawe, a Texas farmer who reluctantly allowed the government to build on his land. This highlights Trump's willingness to use government-sanctioned land grabs while criticizing similar actions overseas.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for a House vote on a sweeping domestic policy bill to advance President Trump's agenda, but it faces significant divisions within the party. The legislation includes tax cuts, increased military spending, and cuts to health, nutrition, and clean energy programs. Sticking points include the state and local tax deduction, Medicaid changes, and clean energy program cuts. The bill's passage hinges on resolving these divisions, as Republicans can afford to lose only a few votes in both the House and the Senate.</p>
