          <p>A recent poll in Japan indicates that a significant majority, 87.1%, of respondents believe that the government's measures to control the surge in rice prices are insufficient.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is being sued by five Texas district attorneys over a new rule granting his office broad access to their case records. The district attorneys argue that the rule is an unconstitutional overreach violating the separation of powers and imposing unnecessary burdens on county prosecutors. Paxton's office claims the provision is intended to "rein in rogue district attorneys," while critics argue it will divert resources from core prosecutorial roles and harm public safety. The lawsuits seek to block Paxton from enforcing the rule, alleging it aims to achieve a political objective.</p>

The author calls for legislative reforms to prevent former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and to target the financial arrangements of administration family members.

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. The shift is evident in projects like Nairobiâ€™s mega-highway and Zambiaâ€™s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. During Kenyan President William Rutoâ€™s visit to China, he sought PPP funding to extend the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Ugandan border, with Chinese firms contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive operating rights for 25 years.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charge current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. These changes are part of Newsom's May revision to address a $12 billion state budget deficit, attributed to Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. While Newsom claims he won't remove anyone from Medi-Cal, the measures are expected to save California $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-29.
