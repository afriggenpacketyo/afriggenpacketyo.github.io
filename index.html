          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how President Trump's policies and political style are influencing elections around the world. In Canada and Australia, center-left incumbents benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment, while in Romania, a right-wing nationalist aligned with the MAGA movement won the first round of the presidential election. The article highlights that Trump's impact is complex and unpredictable, shaping domestic political battles in various ways, including prompting a 'flight to safety' in Singapore and forcing Germany to reconsider its defense spending. The article concludes that an unpredictable American president can have unpredictable consequences for leaders abroad.</p>

          <p>A man in Ohio, Rodney Hinton Jr., has been charged with aggravated murder after allegedly intentionally hitting and killing a Hamilton County Sheriff's deputy with his car.

Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the deputy's death, while the community mourns the loss of a well-liked officer who had recently retired but continued to work off-duty assignments.

          <p>More than half of first-time buyers received financial help from their family to make house purchases last year, according to estimates by estate agency Savills. An average of ¬£55,572 was given in loans and gifts by the so-called bank of mum and dad to buyers. Young buyers faced relatively high mortgage rates in 2024, while also seeing the cost of renting increase. The annual report by Savills suggests that 52% of first-time buyers received assistance from the bank of mum and dad last year, which could also include other donors from the family.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed orders against several law firms, potentially threatening their existence, which has raised concerns about the rule of law. These firms had connections to investigations or legal cases related to Trump or his allies. Targeted firms say the orders amounted to a corporate death penalty, potentially barring attorneys from courthouses and canceling client contracts. Nine major firms made a deal with the White House, agreeing to give nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by the firms and Trump. Some legal experts argue that Trump's actions violate constitutional rights to free speech, due process, and the right to counsel.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down the high costs of egg freezing, a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored until she is ready to have children. It is noted that the process is not guaranteed to be successful, and the costs can be very high. The average cost of a single cycle of egg freezing is around $12,000 to $13,000, and doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation later on to up her chances of success, raising the cost even further.</p>
