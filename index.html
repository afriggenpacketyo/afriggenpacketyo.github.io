          <p>Several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set on fire in downtown Los Angeles during protests against President Trump's immigration policies, leading to the suspension of Waymo's service in the area. The protests erupted following ICE raids, escalating into clashes between protesters and police, with the National Guard being deployed. Some individuals were observed throwing Lime e-scooters into the burning vehicles, posing risks due to the release of toxic gases from burning lithium-ion batteries. The Los Angeles Police Department has issued warnings about the dangers of the fumes, and investigations are ongoing to determine if the vehicles were deliberately targeted, with anti-ICE graffiti found on the vehicles. The article highlights the escalating tensions and the impact of the protests on local services. Optimism surrounding the event is low given the damage and disruption to the community.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are engaged in a heated dispute over immigration protests in Los Angeles, with Trump suggesting Newsom should be arrested and Newsom accusing the White House of exploiting the situation for political gain.

This confrontation highlights their long-standing political differences, including criticisms of each other's leadership and policies. The article also notes Newsom's rising national profile amid speculation about a potential presidential run in 2028.

          <p>U.S. Northern Command has activated approximately 700 Marines to join the National Guard in Los Angeles, forming Task Force 51, in response to ongoing immigration protests. These forces are tasked with protecting federal personnel and property, operating under strict rules of force that prioritize de-escalation. The Marines and National Guard personnel are not using rubber bullets or pepper spray, but will carry ammunition for self-defense purposes. Their role is limited to protecting federal assets and personnel, rather than patrolling streets or detaining rioters on behalf of the police. The deployment underscores the federal government's response to the protests and the rules governing military involvement in domestic situations.</p>

Lively had filed a lawsuit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, alleging sexual harassment on set and retaliation for bringing those complaints. Baldoni's countersuit claimed Lively and others aimed to ruin his career and reputation with the allegations. The judge ruled that Baldoni and his production company did not adequately allege wrongful extortion or prove defamation. The judge also determined that evidence did not show that the New York Times "acted with actual malice" in publishing their story, dismissing that $250m suit as well.</p>

          <p>Executives from the US host city committees for next year’s World Cup said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids have created “uncertainty” as they prepare to host an influx of foreign visitors. The 2026 World Cup will take place in 11 cities across the US, and is predicted to draw more than five million visitors. The host city committees are concerned, in part, with communicating potential issues to fans in areas such as transportation, lodging, and safety. All host city heads said they hoped to provide a welcoming environment for all who visit for the World Cup.</p>
