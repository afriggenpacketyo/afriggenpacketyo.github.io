          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support for the progressive nominee. Sanders highlighted Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case" against oligarchic influence, criticizing mainstream Democrats for their muted support. Mamdani condemned CUNY's dismissal of anti-war professors and vowed to fight capitalistic greed, proposing rent freezes and tax increases for the wealthy. The event underscored a broader struggle for the Democratic Party's future and immigrant rights, with Mamdani promising increased legal aid for detained New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Wolverines faced a challenging night, losing 24-13 to the Oklahoma Sooners, a game further highlighted by an ESPN announcer's "jinx." Commentator Chris Fowler praised kicker Dominic Zvada's accuracy just before Zvada missed a 32-yard field goal attempt. This incident underscored a tough performance for Michigan, where Oklahoma's John Mateer excelled with both passing and rushing touchdowns. The Wolverines fell to 1-1, while the Sooners improved to 2-0, with Michigan's freshman quarterback Bryce Underwood struggling against a strong Oklahoma defense.</p>

          <p>Overnight, Ukraine launched drones at Russia, causing a fire at an oil refinery in Krasnodar, which was quickly extinguished with no casualties reported. Conversely, a series of Russian strikes across Ukraine proved deadly, killing at least two people, including a one-year-old child, and injuring several others. Falling debris from downed drones ignited fires in Kyiv residential buildings. Explosions were also reported in other major Ukrainian cities, prompting Poland to scramble fighter jets to protect its airspace. Diplomatic peace efforts remain stalled as fighting continues.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then collapse, releasing a powerful force. This allows for jumpers to be launched 1.5 meters into the air and can also be controlled for swimming, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. Published in the journal Science, this study showcases cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism, opening new possibilities for robotics and micro-device applications.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report by Portugal's GPIAAF bureau revealed that a cable linking two cabins snapped shortly before the deadly Lisbon funicular crash. The Glória funicular derailed and crashed into a building, killing 16 and injuring 21. Inspectors found that the cable had passed a visual check hours earlier, and scheduled maintenance was up to date. The accident occurred within 50 seconds of the cabins losing their balancing force. Two independent investigations are underway, with a preliminary report expected within 45 days, to determine the full causes of the tragedy involving the 140-year-old streetcar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are extensively using decoys, from inflatable tanks to flat-pack artillery and even fake soldiers, to deceive the enemy and waste valuable ammunition. A video showing a "wooden tank" being hit by a Russian drone exemplifies this tactic. Ukrainian volunteers, like Ruslan Klimenko's group, produce hundreds of easily assembled M777 howitzer models costing around $500, which draw expensive Russian Lancet kamikaze drones ($35,000). Russia also uses imitation drones to overload Ukrainian air defenses. These sophisticated deception strategies highlight a crucial, often unseen, aspect of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born boy who died at 15 from leukemia, is set to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint. Known as "God's influencer," he created websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teaching. His canonization, postponed due to Pope Francis's death, follows the attribution of two miracles to him. Millions have made pilgrimages to his preserved body in Assisi, Italy, and his baptismal church in Chelsea, London, has seen increased visitors. The Vatican reportedly fast-tracked his sainthood to inspire faith in young people, bridging technology and traditional spirituality.</p>

          <p>The US Men's National Team (USMNT) suffered a disappointing 2-0 loss to South Korea, extending their slump and raising "alarm bells" just 279 days before hosting the World Cup. Coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental roster failed to translate initial flashes into positive results, with a notable lack of communication in defense. Son Heung-min scored the opening goal, exploiting defensive gaps, and contributed to the second. Despite Pochettino's claims of team evolution, missed chances and disjointed play characterized the US performance, leaving many questioning their readiness for the global stage.</p>

          <p>International postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to eliminate a tariff exemption for low-cost imports. This policy change, effective August 29, 2025, removed the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, shifting the burden of customs duty collection to carriers. Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the US due to inability or unwillingness to collect these duties. The Universal Postal Union warned of "major operational disruptions," criticizing the lack of sufficient time and guidance for compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

While intended to replace manual passport stamping and improve efficiency, concerns persist about potential long queues during the initial rollout, particularly at busy points like Dover. A mobile app for pre-registration is also being developed to ease the process.</p>

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized these are "life and death matters," necessitating billions in investment for coastal defenses like seawalls and land reclamation.
