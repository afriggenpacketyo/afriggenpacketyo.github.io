          <p>This New York Times article discusses the growing fear among immigrants, documented and undocumented, of seeking medical care due to the Trump administration's policies on immigration enforcement. The rescinding of protections for hospitals and clinics has led to increased anxiety and no-show rates, with potential consequences including the spread of infectious diseases and worsening chronic conditions. Doctors and social workers report a significant drop in Spanish-language interpretation requests and instances of patients delaying or forgoing critical care, with the article highlighting individual cases and the challenges faced by healthcare facilities in addressing these issues.

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the challenges facing Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition in Germany as they confront the growing influence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD's rise in the polls and its anti-establishment campaign, coupled with the domestic intelligence service declaring the AfD an extremist organization, has heightened tensions within the ruling coalition.

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will donate 99% of his remaining wealth to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned, with the goal of saving tens of millions of lives.

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade agreements could be announced this week, with overtures to the U.K. potentially marking the first of several deals. Amid ongoing economic uncertainty and pressure to strike deals before a tariff pause ends, the administration is in negotiation mode with various countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that a significant portion of these deals could be finalized by the end of the year. However, experts caution that negotiations could extend into June, with smaller countries potentially acting more swiftly due to their urgent need for agreements. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that climate change made the deadly storms and flooding in the Midwest and South in early April more intense, increasing rainfall by about 9%. Unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change, contributed to the storm's intensity.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to maintain steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainties stemming from tariffs. Trump expressed his frustration, arguing that Powell's decision was a mistake, especially with low inflation and tariff revenue flowing into the U.S. The Fed indicated that rates would remain unchanged until the economic outlook becomes clearer, wary of sparking inflation with tariff policies. Despite Trump's past threats, he recently stated he has no intention of firing Powell, though he still referred to him as a "total stiff". The optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>A judge ruled that Bryan Kohberger's immediate family members will be allowed to attend his upcoming quadruple-murder trial, even if they might be called to testify. The judge balanced Kohberger's right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining forthright testimony. He noted that the scope of their proposed testimony is narrow, and they have previously given recorded interviews. Kohberger is charged in the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students and faces the death penalty if convicted. The optimism score is 60.</p>
