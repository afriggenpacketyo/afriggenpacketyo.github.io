        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms covering much of southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales. The warning, effective from 09:00 to 18:00 BST on Saturday, forecasts 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour, with some areas potentially seeing 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency also cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds, which could disrupt transport, cause power outages, and damage buildings. While thunderstorms are difficult to predict precisely, they are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, and Sunday should be brighter with fewer showers. The potential for disruption highlights the unpredictable nature of these weather events. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is concluding its first celebration in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade that began Saturday in a historic gay neighborhood and ends at the U.S. Capitol. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest Pride celebrations in the country. Despite the usual magnitude, organizers noted that the current political environment, including executive orders limiting trans rights, has dampened excitement. Some corporate sponsors declined to support the event due to executive orders targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park, a queer landmark, sparked backlash, adding to the tension surrounding the celebration. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, with Donald Trump's policies expected to add trillions more. Several Republican senators are threatening to block his spending plans, and concerns are mounting on Wall Street, with some investors warning of a crisis within three years. A recent downgrade by Moody's cited the failure of successive administrations to address large deficits and rising interest costs. While Trump has called for efficiency, his tax cuts are projected to significantly increase the debt burden, highlighting the challenges of balancing economic policies with fiscal prudence. This article discusses how the policies of Trump may affect the economy. (not investment advice) Optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>A Georgia law granting fetal 'personhood' is being tested in the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman kept on life support. The law, known as the LIFE Act, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected and grants fetuses the same rights as a person. Doctors have kept Smith on life support, raising questions about whether the law requires this intervention, with differing legal opinions on whether removing life support would constitute an abortion. This case highlights the broader implications of 'personhood' laws on medical care and reproductive rights, as well as the potential for conflicts between fetal rights and a woman's autonomy. The debate underscores the complex legal and ethical considerations surrounding fetal personhood. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Foot care experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving overall foot health. These exercises include foot doming, which strengthens the foot core; wall stretches, effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow; and toe spreads, which improve flexibility and stability. Toe yoga enhances balance, calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles, and interlacing fingers with toes provides a gentle massage. Regularly practicing these exercises can reduce the risk of injury, prevent pain, and improve foot function. These simple exercises can be incorporated into daily routines for optimal foot health.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe store prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns about the rising cost of the staple food. More than 40 percent of respondents fear that consumers may start avoiding rice due to prices that have doubled in the past year. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers in an effort to lower prices, which currently average 4,200 yen ($29) per 5 kilograms. Producers suggest a reasonable price for both producers and consumers would be 3,000 yen per 5 kg, highlighting the need for a consensus on pricing.

          <p>The UK government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. This is only marginally less than the £2.3bn spent in 2024/25, despite efforts to reduce the use of hotels by increasing dispersal accommodation. Foreign aid is intended to alleviate poverty overseas, but international rules allow some of it to be spent on asylum seekers in their first year.
