        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures will grant police chiefs the power to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to bolster public confidence in policing. This reform, prompted by an independent report following Sarah Everard's murder by a police officer, makes passing vetting checks a legal requirement for all serving officers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized the necessity of these rules to remove officers unfit to serve or posing risks, ensuring only those of the highest standards wear the uniform. The changes address concerns about officers remaining on full pay despite failing vetting, a practice deemed "absurd" by Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>Tesla is cautiously planning its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, due to high tariffs and luxury taxes on imported electric vehicles. These tariffs could potentially double the price of Tesla vehicles sold in India, making it a challenging market to penetrate. Despite the difficulties, Taneja acknowledged India's potential as a "great market" with a significant middle class.
