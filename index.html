        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible across parts of the United Kingdom, turning the full Moon a deep red color, an event commonly known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. While visibility in the UK will be limited by the Moon's rising time, with eastern regions getting the best view, the event offers a chance to observe celestial mechanics in action. Unlike solar eclipses, this event is safe to view directly, and the next total lunar eclipse visible from the UK is not expected until 2026.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is reportedly planning to step down from his position less than a year after taking office. This decision follows significant political setbacks for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its majority in both houses of parliament. The LDP failed to secure a majority in the lower house after snap elections last October and also fell short in the upper house elections this past July. The party is now expected to hold a new leadership race to select his successor.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his technological skills, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The canonization, which required the attribution of two miracles to him, was fast-tracked by the Vatican in an effort to inspire faith among young people. A shrine containing a strand of his hair has been established at the London church where he was baptized.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the attack, stating it involved over 800 munitions and resulted in at least two fatalities. The roof and upper floors of the government building were damaged, prompting Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to call for more international military assistance. Zelenskyy described the attack as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war and urged the implementation of agreements made with international partners.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has finalized discussions with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery facility in Georgia. US officials detained 475 people, including over 300 South Korean nationals, for allegedly working illegally. The White House defended the raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as necessary to protect American jobs. The incident has caused concern in Seoul, a key US ally, as it occurs during sensitive trade talks and could impact foreign investment.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old Texas woman, Natasha Marie O'Dell, has been sentenced to six years in federal prison for the 2023 arson of the Seattle Laestadian Lutheran Church in Washington. O'Dell pleaded guilty to charges including arson and damage to religious property, admitting she was angry about churches. Surveillance footage that survived the fire captured her pouring gasoline on the building's exterior. The attack caused over $3.2 million in damages, completely destroying the congregation's spiritual home and injuring one firefighter who responded to the blaze.</p>

This shift, managed by the USTA, aims to capture the attention economy by creating a constant stream of social media content.

The strike, which is the first to close the entire network since March 2023, is expected to cause little or no service on most lines and has already forced the rescheduling of concerts by artist Post Malone.</p>

The article contends that Trump respects strength and that leaders who stand firm, such as Brazil's Lula da Silva, fare better than those who seek his favor. The author is highly critical of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approach ahead of Trump's upcoming state visit, suggesting it positions Britain as a subservient state.

          <p>A team of researchers from the US and China has developed a novel method to launch tiny, millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material, causing nearby water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching the micro-jumpers up to 1.5 meters high. This technique offers a new and efficient launching mechanism that could have applications in robotics and material science.</p>
