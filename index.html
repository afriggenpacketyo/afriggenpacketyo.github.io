          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated his commitment to bolstering China's advanced manufacturing capabilities, a strategy that has drawn criticism from the United States and other major trade partners due to concerns about deepening global trade imbalances. During a visit to Henan province, Xi emphasized self-reliance in advanced manufacturing as crucial for China's economy. This push aligns with the "Made in China 2025" plan, which aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer in sectors like electric vehicles and semiconductors. Despite significant state subsidies, China has faced challenges in meeting key targets and has fostered unhealthy industrial competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attacked Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies, branding them as "fantasy" economics and drawing parallels to Liz Truss's economic strategy. Starmer warned that Reform's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs. Reform UK has gained traction in recent local elections, posing a challenge to traditional British political parties. Farage's proposals include tax breaks for married couples and scrapping the two-child benefit cap, but economists have questioned the feasibility of these plans, particularly regarding how they would be funded. </p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying its competition with OpenAI. The upgraded model, released on AI model repository Hugging Face, follows DeepSeek's earlier success with its free, open-source R1 model, which outperformed offerings from rivals like Meta and OpenAI. The company's low-cost and rapid development sparked concerns about overspending among U.S. tech giants. The upgraded DeepSeek R1 model is designed for more complex tasks through logical thought processes and benchmarks closely with OpenAI's o4-mini and o3 models. </p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that he overstepped his authority by invoking an emergency law. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce, not the president unilaterally. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which was prompted by a lawsuit from small businesses importing goods. If the appeal fails, businesses that paid tariffs will receive refunds. The decision has been welcomed by global markets, with stock markets rising and the US dollar gaining strength. </p>

Wu Xinbo of Fudan University believes that while President Trump may continue using tariffs, he will exercise more restraint after observing their mixed results. Wu suggests that Trump might explore measures related to science, diplomacy, and security. This shift could occur because tariffs have had limited impact on China while causing significant side effects for the US. </p>

The party secured 60 seats in the National Assembly, surpassing the Socialists and marking a significant shift in Portuguese politics. Chega's rise coincides with gains by far-right parties in other European countries, such as France's National Rally and the Brothers of Italy. Chega, which means "Enough," campaigned on a hardline stance against immigration and capitalized on the inability of traditional parties to form lasting governments.</p>

          <p>In the sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, a judge denied a motion for a mistrial requested by Combs' defense team. The motion was prompted by testimony related to the alleged firebombing of Kid Cudi's Porsche and the destruction of fingerprint evidence. The trial continued with testimony from a friend of Combs' former lover, Cassie Ventura, who described instances of physical and verbal abuse. Prosecutors allege that Combs used his wealth and power to coerce women into sexual acts. </p>
