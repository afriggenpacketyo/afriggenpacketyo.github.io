            <p>China has retaliated against the U.S.'s reciprocal tariffs by increasing levies on U.S. goods to 125% from 84%, according to a statement from the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council. The statement suggests that even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of the world economy. The statement also said that if the U.S. continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the U.S., China will ignore it. This escalation in the trade war underscores the deepening economic tensions between the two nations. Optimism score should be low due to the escalation of a trade war.</p>

            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River near Jersey City, killing all six people on board. The victims included a family of five from Spain, consisting of Siemens executive Agustin Escobar, his wife, and their three young children, as well as the pilot. Witnesses reported seeing helicopter parts separating mid-air before the crash, and officials believe the helicopter hit the water inverted. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the cause of the crash, which involved a Bell 206 helicopter operated by New York Helicopters, with previous incidents on New York City's rivers also being recalled.</p>

            <p>Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract with Liverpool, extending his time with the club despite lucrative offers from elsewhere. Salah, who will be 33 in June, would have been a free agent at the end of the season, attracting interest from major European clubs and the Saudi Pro League. He had previously expressed uncertainty about his future at Liverpool, but has now committed to remain at Anfield, continuing a successful partnership that began in 2017. This extension is viewed as a perfect outcome for both Salah and Liverpool, solidifying his legacy with the Reds.</p>

Suren Thiru from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales suggests that the uncertainty created by the tariffs will likely influence the Bank of England's decision on interest rates next month. Markets are pricing in a potential interest rate cut in May, but welfare spending cuts and a greater tax burden on businesses create concerns about the economy's outlook.</p>

            <p>Alexandra Bitušíková recounts how a grassroots movement in Slovakia successfully ousted a neo-Nazi regional governor. The movement, Not in Our Town (Niot), used public discussions, educational programs, and protests to expose the governor's extremist ideology. Niot facilitated dialogue among moderate groups to unite behind a single democratic candidate, increasing voter participation. Now, Niot is protesting against the pro-Russia stance of Prime Minister Robert Fico, advocating for Slovakia's alignment with Europe.</p>

            <p>Economists believe China is unlikely to aggressively devalue its currency, the yuan, to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs, citing concerns about financial market instability and capital outflows. Despite recent weakening of the yuan, analysts expect the central bank to manage an orderly and gradual depreciation rather than a significant devaluation. A rapid outflow of capital from the country may complicate policymakers' jobs even further, given China's already stuttering economy. Devaluation is no longer an effective trade weapon, as it invites financial crisis, according to analysts.</p>
