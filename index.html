          <p>The UK has initiated a widespread rollout of a gonorrhoea vaccine through sexual health clinics, marking a global first in public health. The program will initially target high-risk individuals, such as gay and bisexual men with multiple partners, in response to the highest infection levels recorded in nearly a century. Officials hope the 4CMenB vaccine, originally for meningitis B, will prevent up to 100,000 cases and combat rising antibiotic resistance. The move is seen as a significant advancement in sexual health, offering an additional tool alongside condoms and other preventative measures.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 30 Democratic lawmakers has fled Texas for Illinois to prevent a vote on a new congressional map proposed by Republicans. By leaving the state, they aim to deny the legislature the necessary quorum to approve the map, which could create five new Republican-leaning districts. The Democrats accuse the GOP of pushing a partisan gerrymander at the behest of Donald Trump. This action could result in daily fines and potential arrest for the absent lawmakers under a recently passed state law.</p>

He died from smoke inhalation after Israeli settlers allegedly set fire to homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence and is providing consular assistance to his family. This incident occurs amid a documented increase in settler attacks and broader violence in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

The UN's migration agency reported that at least 68 people have died, with another 74 missing and presumed dead, while only 12 migrants survived. This tragedy highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route through war-torn Yemen, which many from East Africa and the Horn of Africa undertake in hopes of reaching Gulf Arab countries for work.</p>

          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey retreat. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention and escorted the plane out of the restricted area. This was one of five unauthorized airspace incursions over the weekend, prompting officials to remind private pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>According to an Israeli official, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advocating for expanded military operations in Gaza as a means to free the remaining hostages held by Hamas. This reported shift in strategy stems from a growing belief within the Israeli government that diplomatic negotiations for a hostage deal are not progressing. The news comes as thousands of protesters in Tel Aviv continue to demand the government prioritize the safe return of the approximately 20 living hostages still in captivity.</p>

          <p>Recent reports suggest Apple is exploring a potential acquisition of the AI search and chatbot company Perplexity.

Analysts note that Perplexity's focus on providing direct, real-time answers and a streamlined user experience aligns well with Apple's long-standing product philosophy, making it a logical, albeit expensive, strategic target.

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Erika McEntarfer, following a jobs report with downward revisions. A top economic adviser cited the routine data revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the dismissal, after Trump had claimed the numbers were "rigged." Critics, including a former Trump-appointed BLS chief, have condemned the move as a dangerous politicization that undermines the credibility of vital government economic data.

          <p>In a formal court filing, the Trump administration's lawyers have denied that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operates under a daily quota for arrests. This legal declaration directly contradicts a previous public statement from White House adviser Stephen Miller, who said the administration was aiming for a goal of 3,000 arrests per day. The filing was part of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of immigration sweeps, creating a stark discrepancy between the administration's official court position and its public rhetoric.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, Florida added more utility-scale solar capacity than traditional leader California last year, a boom driven largely by utility companies rather than rooftop panels. This growth is attributed to the favorable economics of solar power and a state rule that streamlines the review process for projects under 75 megawatts. Despite the state government removing climate change from official policy, utilities are embracing solar as a cheaper alternative to natural gas, though the rollback of federal tax credits poses a future challenge.
