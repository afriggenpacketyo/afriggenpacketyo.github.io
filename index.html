          <p>A terror attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Manchester resulted in the deaths of two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, and left three others seriously injured. The suspect, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot and killed by police after ramming a car into worshippers and attacking them with a knife on Yom Kippur. Worshippers and security staff are being praised for their bravery in preventing the attacker from entering the building. The incident has prompted widespread condemnation and calls for increased security for Jewish communities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that a fourth military strike was conducted in international waters near Venezuela, destroying a small boat allegedly carrying narcotics. The operation resulted in the deaths of four individuals described as "narco-terrorists." This action follows President Trump's recent declaration of drug cartels as unlawful combatants, escalating the U.S. into what is now described as an "armed conflict" with these groups. The strike is part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean aimed at disrupting drug trafficking routes.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have confirmed that two victims of the recent synagogue attack were struck by police gunfire during the response to the incident. One of the victims, Adrian Daulby, was fatally wounded, while another remains hospitalized with a gunshot injury. The police chief constable stated that the initial investigation suggests the suspect was not armed with a firearm, leading to the conclusion that the shots came from officers. Both victims were reportedly behind a door, helping to prevent the attacker from gaining entry when they were hit.</p>

Negotiations appear stalled as both parties remain firm on their positions, particularly concerning Democratic demands for extending healthcare subsidies. With no agreement in sight, the shutdown is likely to extend through the weekend, potentially lasting at least six days. The White House has indicated that "thousands" of federal workers could face job losses during the impasse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provocative statue depicting President Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein holding hands has reappeared on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The sculpture, created by an anonymous art collective, was abruptly removed by U.S. Park Police less than a day after its initial installation, despite the artists having a permit. The group, The Secret Handshake, recovered the damaged statue and successfully re-erected it after obtaining a new permit. The artwork aims to highlight the controversial and downplayed friendship between the two figures.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees third baseman Ryan McMahon made a spectacular defensive play, flipping over the dugout railing to catch a foul ball and help preserve a historic postseason performance by rookie pitcher Cam Schlittler. Schlittler pitched eight scoreless innings with 12 strikeouts and no walks, a first in MLB postseason history. The Yankees defeated their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, in the winner-take-all game, advancing to the American League Division Series. The team's offense was highlighted by a four-run fourth inning that secured their victory.</p>

          <p>An analysis by NPR finds that Republican claims blaming the government shutdown on Democratic efforts to secure healthcare for undocumented immigrants are false. Experts confirm that undocumented individuals are already barred from receiving benefits through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The central dispute revolves around Democratic demands to extend ACA subsidies for low-income Americans and reverse Medicaid cuts, which are part of a recent GOP-backed law. The rhetoric appears to be a political tactic, misrepresenting the actual legislative conflict over funding for existing programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As fans rush to buy Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," on vinyl, an old piece of legislation is protecting them from higher prices. A Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment exempts "informational materials," including physical music, from presidential tariffs. This has shielded the booming vinyl record industry from recent trade disputes, which is welcome news for record labels and consumers but a point of contention for some U.S.-based manufacturers who argue it hurts domestic business. The vinyl market's resurgence, largely driven by younger consumers, continues to be a significant revenue source for artists like Swift.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Raunaq Alam, has been sentenced to six months in jail for spray-painting "Fuck Israel" on a church wall, after a judge overruled a jury's recommendation for community supervision. The jury found Alam guilty of criminal mischief but rejected a hate-crime enhancement, which argued the graffiti targeted a group by national origin or religion. The defense contended the act was protected free speech, similar to saying "Fuck America." The judge, however, added jail time to the sentence, calling the graffiti "disgusting" in a case that highlights ongoing tensions over free speech and political protest.</p>

          <p>The Scottish craft beer company Brewdog has announced it will be cutting jobs after posting a pre-tax loss of £37 million last year. This marks the fifth straight year the company has been unprofitable, with total losses now reaching £148 million. The number of job cuts has not been specified, but staff were informed that the decision was made to "right-size" the business and focus investment in key areas. The announcement follows the recent departure of co-founder Martin Dickie and the closure of ten UK bars earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>As the Nobel Prize announcements approach, a representative from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has warned that academic freedom is under threat in the United States and other nations. Ylva Engstrom, the academy's vice-president, specifically criticized the Trump administration's policies, such as proposed budget cuts to research and prioritizing "patriotic education," calling them reckless and potentially devastating. The administration denies stifling academic freedom, stating its measures aim to cut waste and promote U.S. innovation. The warning highlights growing concerns in the scientific community about political interference in research and education.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team delivered a commanding 10-wicket victory over South Africa in their opening match of the Women's World Cup, providing a much-needed statement win. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was instrumental, dismantling South Africa's powerful top-order batters and setting the tone for a dominant performance. The result offers a strong response to criticism the team faced after a poor showing in the last T20 World Cup and the Ashes. The emphatic nature of the win positions England favorably for the upcoming matches in the tournament.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has criticized pro-Palestinian demonstrations that took place shortly after the deadly Manchester synagogue attack, calling the decision to proceed "un-British" and "wrong." She urged protesters to "step back" from planned weekend marches, citing the need for sensitivity in the wake of the terror incident. Her comments reflect a broader debate, with police and Jewish community leaders expressing concern that the protests could heighten tensions, while organizers maintain their right to peaceful assembly and plan to continue.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price rallied to within 1% of its all-time high as the U.S. government shutdown continued, suggesting investors are increasingly treating the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset. The digital currency has gained 12% this week alone, with analysts noting that its recent performance correlates with rising concerns over U.S. government risks and stability. This trend marks a shift from previous shutdowns, during which Bitcoin's market was in a different phase and did not react as strongly. Some analysts are now predicting the cryptocurrency could soon surpass its previous record and reach new heights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is leading her party further into irrelevance by misinterpreting the reasons for its recent election defeat. The article criticizes her premise that the party "governed left," pointing to a legacy of austerity, a hard Brexit, and anti-immigration laws. Her resulting policy choices, such as repealing the Climate Change Act and threatening to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, are described as reckless posturing. The editorial concludes that her strategy aligns the party with a fanatical right-wing agenda that will not appeal to mainstream voters.</p>

          <p>Des Moines Public Schools has filed a lawsuit against the consulting firm it hired to find its superintendent, alleging the company failed to properly vet Ian Roberts, who was arrested by immigration authorities last week.

The lawsuit accuses JG Consulting of breach of contract and negligence, stating Roberts should never have been presented as a finalist.

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, both Google and Apple have removed apps from their online stores that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Attorney General Pam Bondi directly requested that Apple remove an app called ICEBlock, citing safety risks to law enforcement. The move came after the FBI revealed that a gunman who attacked a Dallas ICE facility had used such an app. While the app's creator stated it was designed to help immigrants, officials argued it put a "target on federal law enforcement officers' backs."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Before paying a debt collector, it is crucial to take several protective steps to avoid potential pitfalls. First, consumers should always validate that the debt is legitimate and that the collector has the legal right to pursue it by requesting written proof. Second, it is important to weigh all options, such as negotiating a settlement for a lower amount or exploring formal debt relief programs, especially if the debt is old. Finally, one must get any payment or settlement agreement in writing before sending any money to ensure the terms are clear and the matter is fully resolved.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has given Hamas a Sunday evening deadline to accept a new U.S.-backed peace plan for Gaza, warning that "all hell" will break out if they refuse. The proposal includes an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. While mediators are urging Hamas to accept, a senior figure in the group has indicated a rejection is likely, partly because the plan requires them to give up all hostages early on. The plan also states Hamas will have no future role in governing Gaza.</p>
