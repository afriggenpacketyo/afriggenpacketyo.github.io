          <p>Kelly Stafford, wife of NFL quarterback Matthew Stafford, discussed the inclusion of significant others at the NFL Draft on her podcast. She questioned the practice of players bringing girlfriends, citing potential future breakups that would leave them in draft photos. Stafford also drew a parallel to wedding party decisions, wondering if it is wise to include a sibling's partner if they are not engaged, as they might not be around in the future. The podcast also touches on friendship and parenting, with Kelly sharing personal vulnerabilities and experiences. </p>

          <p>Chilean-French rapper Ana Tijoux, based in Barcelona, discusses her return to music after a decade, marked by motherhood and navigating the changing music industry. She's releasing both a new album, "Vida," and an EP, "Serpiente de Madera," the latter being a return to simpler hip-hop roots with producer Hordatoj. Tijoux expresses discomfort with the rapid pace of the industry and hyper-consumption, preferring a slower, more thoughtful approach to her art. Despite acknowledging the challenging global political climate, she emphasizes the importance of hope and action over fear, particularly in the face of injustice and oppression.</p>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration, which they believe is transforming the U.S. into an authoritarian state. The letter cites concerns about the administration's actions, including attacks on independent media and the seizure of private data. Bessent responded by dismissing the letter as the work of "close-minded progressives" and reaffirmed his commitment to serving in the Trump administration. The letter highlights the deep divisions and concerns surrounding the current political climate.</p>

          <p>The ongoing conflict in Sudan has resulted in the widespread destruction and looting of the nation's museums, including the National Museum in Khartoum. Priceless artifacts from ancient Nubian civilizations have been either destroyed or stolen, with officials suspecting that many items were taken to the UAE to be sold. The Sudanese government plans to contact Interpol and UNESCO to recover the stolen artifacts, but the task is expected to be difficult. The RSF denies accusations of deliberately targeting cultural sites, while Sudanese officials see the attacks as an attempt to erase Sudanese identity and history.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are requesting exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, citing the financial strain caused by increased import taxes. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to provide relief, noting that smaller enterprises lack the resources to absorb price shocks. The tariffs, which include high rates on Chinese imports, are intended to protect domestic manufacturing, but critics argue they disproportionately harm small businesses. Isabel Guzman highlights that small businesses do not have the cash reserves of larger businesses, meaning they will be more greatly affected by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to the White House's peace plan, which seeks to end the war with Russia.

The plan does not explicitly mention regaining all lost territory or joining NATO, signaling a willingness to negotiate. The timing of President Zelensky's potential attendance at Pope Francis' funeral is uncertain due to ongoing Russian attacks.</p>

The proposed regulations would allow testing of trucks over 10,001 lbs, opening the door for companies to test the technology. While other states already allow such testing, California currently prohibits it. The regulations are subject to public comment and are expected to face pushback from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job losses.</p>

          <p>Pirates outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended and fined for making a crude gesture towards fans during a game against the Angels. The incident involved Pham making a hand-jerking gesture after a fan touched him near the left-field wall. Pham is appealing the suspension. This is not the first time Pham has had run-ins with fans and other players, as he has a history of verbal and physical altercations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion, but an analysis suggests these cuts have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The analysis tallies costs associated with paid leave, re-hiring mistakes, and lost productivity. The analysis also notes that the IRS may forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. The White House disputes the analysis, while Musk plans to curtail his work at DOGE starting in May.</p>
