          <p>The BMJ Group has retracted a study that claimed apple cider vinegar could lead to significant weight loss, citing concerns about the work's quality. The study, published in March 2024, had gained global media attention but was met with skepticism from nutrition experts who found its results implausible, rivaling those of prescription drugs like Ozempic. This retraction adds to a growing body of scientific pushback against the health claims associated with the popular wellness product, which has been endorsed by celebrities and influencers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is beginning a pivotal new term that will directly confront the scope of presidential authority, with several cases stemming from Donald Trump's executive agenda. The court's 6-3 conservative majority will review challenges related to tariffs, the president's power to fire members of independent federal agencies, and other Trump-era policies. This follows a period where the court frequently granted the administration emergency appeals, leading to tension and criticism from lower court judges and the court's liberal wing about the judiciary's role.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is causing a significant stir among China's new generation of writers, sparking a debate about its role as either a helpful tool or a creative threat. At a recent conference in Suzhou, authors expressed mixed feelings, with some calling for stronger copyright protections to counter AI's growing capabilities. The psychological impact is particularly strong for emerging writers, who feel that AI has rapidly achieved a level of competence that approaches human creativity.</p>

          <p>A pirate flag from the Japanese anime series 'One Piece' has become a unifying symbol for Gen Z-led protests across Africa and Asia. The flag, representing a band of rebels fighting an oppressive government in the show, resonates with young people who feel unheard and are challenging corrupt systems. Experts note that the narrative of outsiders coming together translates across borders, allowing protesters in countries like Nepal, Morocco, and Madagascar to express solidarity and a shared desire for freedom and justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Conservative party has announced a new immigration plan that aims to remove 750,000 migrants within five years, drawing inspiration from Trump-style deportation policies. The proposal includes banning asylum claims from those who enter the country without permission and replacing judicial appeals with an internal Home Office process. To execute this, the party would create a reformed "Removals Force" with increased funding and powers, a move that establishes a clear policy distinction from the Labour government ahead of their annual conference.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to grant police broader powers to impose conditions on repeated protests, allowing them to consider the "cumulative impact" on communities. This move follows a weekend of large-scale demonstrations and nearly 500 arrests, prompting concerns about public order and community safety. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the new rules are about placing restrictions, such as location or duration, on protests to balance the right to demonstrate with the public's right to live without intimidation, particularly in light of recent tensions.</p>

          <p>Russia launched an intense wave of overnight missile and drone attacks across Ukraine, resulting in at least five deaths and leaving tens of thousands without electricity. The strikes targeted multiple regions, including the western city of Lviv, where four fatalities occurred, and the city of Zaporizhzhia. In response to the aerial assault near its border, neighboring Poland scrambled its own fighter jets to ensure the security of its airspace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reiterated his call for more advanced air defense systems to counter the ongoing aerial terror.</p>

The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating accurate voter registries due to widespread displacement from the civil war as the reason for this system.

The political division over EV policy, with the Trump administration aiming to scrap subsidies, contrasts with more aggressive measures in other major markets, leaving the American auto industry at a competitive disadvantage.

          <h2>Opinion: Donald Trump's Aggressive Latin America Policy Is Seen as Unplanned and Counterproductive</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's foreign policy towards Latin America is haphazard, aggressive, and ultimately self-defeating, particularly in his approach to Venezuela. The author contends that recent U.S. military buildups and strikes on Venezuelan vessels are not part of a coherent strategy but rather impulsive actions that risk destabilizing the region. This bullying tactic, far from achieving U.S. goals, is seen as rallying support for authoritarian leaders like Nicolás Maduro and pushing regional governments away from Washington and closer to rivals like China.</p>

          <p>A chilling investigation into the rapidly growing crime of "sextortion" traces the phenomenon to organized networks of scammers, or "Yahoo Boys," in Nigeria who target vulnerable teenagers in the US and Europe. The report details the tragic story of Evan Boettler, a 16-year-old who took his own life after being blackmailed with explicit images he was tricked into sending. These scammers operate from "Hustle Kingdoms," where they systematically exploit victims' fears, while social media platforms face criticism for not doing enough to prevent the abuse.</p>
