          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, impacting over 8,000 individuals who were granted work permits and deportation reprieves due to unsafe conditions in Afghanistan. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Afghanistan's improved security and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return, reversing the Biden administration's extension of TPS following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Advocates have criticized the decision, citing the ongoing humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses by the Taliban. The Trump administration is also challenging a judge's halt on rolling back TPS for Venezuela, seeking Supreme Court intervention.</p>

          <p>The head of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and several teams within the agency have had their layoff notices rescinded, restoring worker safety programs that were previously eliminated. This reversal occurred ahead of congressional hearings with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who faced questions about the layoffs and their impact on worker safety. Reinstated programs include those focused on respiratory health, safety research, compensation analysis, and personal protective technology. However, many workers remain laid off, and some programs, like those in the Spokane and Pittsburgh Mining Research Division, are only temporarily reinstated to wind down operations.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods following trade talks in Geneva have prompted mainland-based auto-parts producers to reassess plans for building production facilities in the US. The US agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, offering a temporary reprieve for vendors who export nearly 100 billion yuan worth of auto parts to the US annually. However, uncertainty remains as the outlook is unclear, with tariffs potentially jumping again after 90 days, impacting the ability of Chinese vendors and American customers to strike deals. The current tariff on Chinese-made EV batteries stands at 58.4%.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade ICE agents by escorting him and his lawyer through a back door of her courtroom after learning of the agents' presence. The indictment follows a complaint filed in April, charging Dugan with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench to preserve public confidence in the judiciary, with a reserve judge filling in for her.</p>

          <p>In talks with American negotiators, Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan aims to provide a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and would allow President Trump to claim a significant achievement.</p>

Ministers claim the move will eliminate wasteful duplication, but local health boards are also shedding staff.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office projects that President Trump's tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year, despite recent income tax receipts exceeding expectations. Newsom attributes the expected revenue shortfall to the economic impact of Trump's tariffs, including higher unemployment, inflation, and lower GDP projections. The governor released this information ahead of presenting his revised 2025-26 state budget plan, aiming to place blame on the president for the state's financial challenges. California has also filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs and is seeking a preliminary injunction to freeze them.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed not to cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill to fund his agenda proposes significant cuts to the program. Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, which includes work requirements for recipients and stricter eligibility checks. Despite his promises, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would save $715 billion over the next decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. While promising to protect Medicaid, Trump has also stated that his administration is looking for fraud and abuse in the program.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April rose 2.3% annually, slightly below economists' expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices slightly dropped. Economists are closely watching for signs of Trump's tariffs impacting American households, though the April data may not fully reflect their effects due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. may mitigate inflation, potentially leading to fewer Fed rate cuts in 2025.</p>
