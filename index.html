          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and marking a return to growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. However, the company's adjusted earnings per share of 50 cents missed analyst estimates, causing the stock to dip in extended trading. The profit drop was attributed to lower electric vehicle prices and a 50% rise in operating expenses, partly due to R&D in artificial intelligence. Tesla also noted that the expiration of federal EV tax credits pulled some sales forward into the quarter, and it continues to aim for volume production of its Cybercab and Semi trucks in 2026.</p>

          <p>President Trump's legal team has filed claims requesting approximately $230 million from the Department of Justice to cover damages from past federal investigations, including the Russia probe and the Mar-a-Lago documents case. The request raises significant conflict-of-interest concerns, as top DOJ officials who must approve any settlement, such as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, previously served as Trump's personal defense lawyers in these matters. While Trump has suggested he would donate any settlement to charity, legal experts and some lawmakers have expressed skepticism about the claim's size and the ethical implications of the president effectively suing his own government.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the entire East Wing will be demolished to construct a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a change from President Trump's initial promise that the structure would remain untouched. A senior official cited "structural reasons" for the decision, stating the new wing will be more modern and beautiful. The $250 million project is reportedly being funded by private donors, including a $22 million contribution from Alphabet as part of a legal settlement with Trump. The move has drawn criticism, which the White House has dismissed as "manufactured outrage," while proceeding with the demolition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S. cattle ranchers "don't understand" the benefits of his tariffs after they criticized his proposal to import beef from Argentina to lower consumer prices. He claimed his tariffs are the sole reason for their recent success and urged them to reduce their prices for the benefit of American consumers. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and some Republican senators have strongly opposed the plan, arguing it undermines American producers and interferes with market dynamics. This trade issue adds to existing scrutiny over the administration's financial support for Argentina, particularly a $20 billion currency swap deal.</p>

          <p>After a remarkable rally that saw its price surge over 60% in less than a year, gold experienced its most significant single-day drop in over a decade. The article attributes this sharp decline to several factors, including investors taking profits after the substantial run-up and a strengthening U.S. dollar, which makes gold more expensive for international buyers. Additionally, easing geopolitical tensions and a greater market appetite for riskier assets like stocks have reduced demand for gold as a traditional safe-haven investment. The article suggests investors should consider the dip an opportunity to adjust their portfolios rather than abandoning the asset entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the dissipation of peak interest rates from previous years, high-yield savings accounts still offer competitive returns, with typical rates around 4.20% to 4.30%. This stands in stark contrast to traditional savings accounts, which average a mere 0.40% APY, effectively causing savers to lose purchasing power to inflation. The article calculates potential earnings, showing that a $10,000 deposit could generate over $400 in interest in one year at a 4.30% rate. While these accounts have variable rates susceptible to future cuts, they remain a lucrative option for savers looking to maximize their returns in the current financial climate.

          <p>Following its most severe single-day drop in over a decade, gold prices steadied, hovering near $4,120 per ounce. The initial plunge was attributed to profit-taking and a stronger U.S. dollar after a year-to-date rally of over 60%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin saw a decline of about 3%, trading near $108,000. Some analysts suggest a rotational trade may be occurring, where capital flows from a peaking gold market into Bitcoin, noting a historical lead-lag relationship between the two assets. Despite the recent volatility, strategists believe precious metals will remain supported by macroeconomic factors like potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and ongoing political uncertainty.

          <p>Consumers may face higher turkey prices this Thanksgiving, as the USDA reports a 40% increase in wholesale prices for frozen turkeys compared to last year. The surge is primarily due to a reduced supply, caused by ongoing avian flu outbreaks that have affected over 3 million turkeys this year and a decade-long trend of decreasing production. Despite the wholesale spike, economists suggest that retail price increases might be smaller, as stores often use turkeys as "loss leaders" to attract shoppers. Several major retailers, like Walmart and Aldi, have already announced competitive deals on turkeys and holiday meals to appeal to budget-conscious customers.</p>

          <p>An analysis by Oxford Economics suggests that many American taxpayers may receive larger tax refunds in 2026 due to new retroactive tax breaks in the Republicans' recently passed legislation. The law extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new benefits, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime income and raising the SALT deduction cap. Because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables to reflect these changes, many employees are likely overpaying taxes this year. This could result in an estimated $50 billion windfall for taxpayers, though the report notes that a disproportionate share of the benefits will likely go to upper-income households.</p>

In the interim, staff from several East Wing offices, including the first lady's, have been relocated to other parts of the White House and the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building.</p>

          <p>Despite consistent reports from bank leaders about the surprising resilience of U.S. consumer spending, investors are advised to be discerning before investing broadly in consumer-facing stocks. The article argues that a top-down view is insufficient, as individual company fundamentals and sector-specific challenges, like beef inflation impacting restaurants such as Texas Roadhouse, play a crucial role. While overall spending remains strong, some indicators for the restaurant sector have slowed, and economic uncertainties like trade policy and the government shutdown persist. Successful investments in the current climate require focusing on well-run companies with strong business models, not just on general economic trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is largely driven by national political sentiment and opposition to President Trump. Voters who view the proposition as a way to oppose the Trump administration, which many feel treats California unfairly, are overwhelmingly in favor of it. Conversely, those who see it as a state-level issue tend to oppose it, citing concerns about shifting power from rural areas to cities and potential costs. The poll indicates that the national focus is currently giving the "yes" campaign a majority lead in the heavily-Democratic state.</p>

          <p>Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley conducted a marathon speech on the Senate floor, speaking for over 20 hours to protest the policies of the Trump administration. Beginning Tuesday evening, he criticized the president's deportation efforts, the deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland, and what he termed the "weaponization" of the Justice Department. Merkley described the moment as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," accusing the president of shredding the Constitution. The lengthy address, one of the longest in recent Senate history, was intended to "ring the alarm bells" over what he views as an authoritarian grip on the nation.</p>

          <p>The UK government's national inquiry into grooming gangs is facing growing challenges and criticism over its management. Two potential candidates for chairing the inquiry have withdrawn, and, more significantly, four survivors have quit the advisory panel, raising serious questions about the process. This BBC Newscast segment explores the reasons behind these departures and why establishing the inquiry has become so difficult for the government. The discussion also touches on the current state of inflation, using the recent 134% price increase in orange juice as a case study to explain broader economic trends affecting consumers.</p>

          <p>A trend is emerging where AI startups that are acquired by or receive major investments from large tech companies subsequently conduct significant layoffs. Recent examples include staff reductions at Snorkel AI, Scale AI, and Windsurf following deals with Accenture, Meta, and Cognition, respectively. This pattern reflects a shift in big tech's strategy, where acquisitions are followed by rapid streamlining to eliminate duplicate roles rather than preserving the startup's culture. For tech workers, this creates job volatility in what was considered a promising career path, as the endgame for many startups now appears to involve a higher risk of being laid off.</p>

Credit card rates are also influenced by the prime rate and don't always follow the Fed's lead downwards.

Baldwin subsequently sued the district attorney and special prosecutors, claiming he was made a celebrity scapegoat.

The expert explains that the global jewelry network is small and dealers worldwide are now aware of the stolen items. Each stone has unique characteristics, like DNA, and many are cut in a distinctive antique style, making them easily identifiable even if altered, which would further reduce their value.</p>

However, waiting is also risky, as there is no guarantee the Fed will cut rates or that lenders haven't already priced in the potential changes.
