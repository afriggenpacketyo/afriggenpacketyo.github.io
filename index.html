          <p>Following former President Trump's praise for Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article provides context on the deep historical ties between the United States and Liberia. Founded by freed American slaves, Liberia shares many cultural and political similarities with the U.S., including English as its official language and a flag design that closely mirrors the American one. The piece details six key facts, from its capital being named after a U.S. president to its significant role in global rubber production, explaining why an American accent is common among its populace. The reaction among Liberians to the comment was mixed, with some viewing it as a compliment and others as a sign of ignorance about African nations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated a potential meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi could occur on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit. If the meeting materializes, it would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also suggested the U.S. might seek China's assistance in encouraging Russia to end the war in Ukraine, acknowledging China's supportive role for Moscow. This development comes despite Rubio, known for his hawkish stance, being personally sanctioned by Beijing, making him the first sitting Secretary of State to face such measures.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order with Class Action Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 13:19:58 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked former President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and undocumented immigrants. The judge certified a class action lawsuit, effectively pausing the policy's implementation nationwide for all affected children, and granted a seven-day stay for appeal. The lawsuit challenges the administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically granted citizenship to all persons born in the U.S. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, vowing to fight the decision, while immigrant rights groups continue to challenge the order in multiple courts.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that his country will respond with "reciprocity" to former President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. Trump's letter cited the ongoing prosecution of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and an "unfair trade relationship" as reasons for the steep tariff increase. President da Silva countered that Brazil is a sovereign nation and noted that, contrary to Trump's claims, the U.S. actually holds a trade surplus with Brazil. This trade dispute marks a significant escalation, with Trump explicitly linking punitive economic measures to another nation's internal legal and political affairs. (not investment advice)</p>

This move comes as Musk navigates a challenging period, including a public feud with former President Trump and the recent departure of X CEO Linda Yaccarino. The integration of Grok, which has faced criticism for controversial outputs, and the expansion of the autonomous taxi service signal Tesla's continued push into AI and mobility services. The company is also awaiting regulatory approval to launch the robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next couple of months.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have announced they will not assist contractors in dismantling a controversial bonfire in south Belfast, built for the annual Eleventh Night celebrations. The decision came after a multi-agency risk assessment concluded that intervening to remove the structure would pose a greater risk than allowing it to proceed as planned. The bonfire has raised safety concerns due to its proximity to a major electricity substation supplying two hospitals and the discovery of asbestos at the site. While bonfire builders have voluntarily reduced its size as a gesture of goodwill, the situation remains contentious, highlighting ongoing political and cultural tensions surrounding the annual Twelfth of July events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the historical and cultural significance of the terms "highbrow," "lowbrow," and "middlebrow," centering on Virginia Woolf's passionate defense of highbrow art. In the 1930s, Woolf fiercely argued that the highbrow represented a "thoroughbred intelligence" in pursuit of ideas, while she reserved special contempt for the "middlebrow," who she saw as a dishonest consumer of art without genuine conviction. The essay traces how these concepts emerged during a period of expanding mass media and class division in England. It reflects on how the term "middlebrow" has evolved from a pejorative into a descriptor for harmless, popular culture, questioning the modern relevance of these old cultural battle lines.</p>

This article outlines six signs that negotiating a settlement with creditors could be a beneficial financial move. These indicators include situations where interest payments exceed principal reduction, eligibility for a significant balance reduction, and facing high penalty APRs. The goal of debt forgiveness is to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially saving thousands in interest over time, though it can have a negative impact on one's credit score.

          <p>Sweden's Migration Minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was the individual recently reported by an anti-racism watchdog to have links with white supremacist groups. Forssell stated he was unaware of his son's activities until being notified by the security service a few weeks ago and will not resign from his post. He explained that his son, who allegedly collaborated with a member of the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement, has since cut off these contacts and is deeply remorseful. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has expressed his continued confidence in the minister, but the revelation has prompted criticism from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>Following Costco's solid June sales report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that now is a good time to own the company's stock, particularly as a hedge against inflation. The membership-based retailer reported a 5.5% rise in U.S. core comparable sales, demonstrating resilience in a challenging retail environment. Cramer expressed confidence in Costco's business model, which leverages high volume and membership fees to keep prices low for consumers. Despite some recent pressure on the stock due to its high valuation and tough year-over-year comparisons, Cramer reiterated his "buy" rating, viewing the current price as an attractive entry point.

The suspensions range from 10 to 42 days. The disciplinary action follows investigations that revealed "preventable" lapses, such as allowing the shooter to position himself on an unsecured rooftop with a clear line of sight to the rally stage.

          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum of money, this article compares the earning potential of a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account. While money market accounts offer check-writing features and high rates, those rates are variable. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a set term, providing guaranteed returns. By calculating the interest earned on a $20,000 deposit over various short terms (3, 6, 9, and 12 months), the analysis shows that CDs will almost always yield slightly more guaranteed income than a money market account, assuming current rates.

Russia is now capable of launching vast swarms of hundreds of drones and missiles in a single night, often overwhelming air defenses and spreading fear among civilians in cities far from the front lines. The Iranian-supplied Shahed drones have been modified to fly higher and carry a more lethal payload, eroding Ukrainian morale and straining precious air defense resources. Experts warn that Ukraine faces a significant challenge in countering this war of attrition, which relies on the sheer quantity of low-cost drones.</p>

Duffy, who will lead the agency during a critical period focused on returning astronauts to the moon, is the latest official in the Trump administration to hold a dual-hatted role, serving in two leadership positions simultaneously.</p>

The author contends that Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's desire for flattery to prolong the war in Gaza and maintain his own political power, thereby avoiding domestic legal and political consequences. The article suggests the nomination successfully distracted Trump from pressuring Israel into a ceasefire deal. It criticizes the foundation of the nomination—the Abraham Accords—as a flawed approach that ignored the rights of Palestinians, and calls the gesture a transparent attempt to manipulate the U.S. president.</p>

The author suggests incorporating a short, daily morning routine of sun exposure, while also warning against the risks of overexposure and the negative effects of artificial light at night. Ultimately, the article concludes that while sunlight is a useful tool for well-being, it is no substitute for more significant happiness factors like strong personal relationships.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has enacted a new law requiring food producers and restaurants to disclose if their animal products come from animals that underwent painful mutilations without anesthesia. This includes common practices like the castration of pigs, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. While these procedures are standard in global industrial agriculture, Switzerland already requires pain relief for them domestically. The law aims to increase transparency for consumers about imported products, effectively creating a warning label for items produced with methods considered particularly cruel.
