          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco soon after. The service will begin with approximately 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, with the company carefully watching the cars' performance. Alphabet's Waymo already operates a commercial, driverless ride-hailing service, conducting 250,000 paid trips weekly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal medical research grants, including those backed by Joe Biden's "Cancer Moonshot" initiative, have been disrupted due to cuts imposed by the Trump administration on Columbia University and Harvard University. The funding freeze is a result of the administration's allegations of unchecked antisemitism at these universities amid pro-Palestinian protests. Scientists at Harvard report the termination of NIH funding for research on mutations linked to breast cancer and recurrence of ovarian cancer. The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center at Columbia University has also had its funding terminated. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to look for cuts to Columbia's funding, citing antisemitism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's plans to escalate the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid, actions they deemed "disproportionate" and "egregious." The countries expressed concern about the high Palestinian death toll and dire humanitarian conditions, with the UN warning of potential famine. Britain suspended free-trade agreement talks with Israel, while France suggested the EU could suspend its agreement with Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, accusing the allied countries of encouraging further attacks by Hamas. The US has not publicly criticized the renewed offensive, but President Trump has bypassed Netanyahu to negotiate with Hamas and address the humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is set to unveil plans for a massive missile shield system, dubbed "Golden Dome," to protect the United States from missile threats. The project, led by Gen. Michael Guetlein, is reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program and could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. Trump's push for the shield, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, gained momentum after Iran's attacks in 2024. Questions remain about the system's scope and impact on other vital programs, such as the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile replacement. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that developing and launching a network of space-based interceptors could cost $161 billion to $542 billion over 20 years.</p>

          <p>Liberty Steel is making a final attempt to prevent the closure of its plants in Rotherham and Sheffield, which could result in the loss of 1,450 jobs. A court could force the company's speciality steel business to close due to unpaid debts unless an adjournment is granted. Government sources have indicated they are not prepared to intervene financially to save Liberty Steel. Creditors are seeking liquidation to sell Liberty's assets and recover owed money. The company has faced financial challenges since the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital, in 2021.</p>

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office stated Italy's readiness to facilitate contacts and work towards peace in Ukraine. Although the Vatican is "always ready" to bring enemies together, there is no firm agreement on further discussions. Ukraine is open to Vatican hosting talks, while the Kremlin prefers Turkey and continues to push for recognition of its annexation of Ukrainian regions.

The new sanctions target Russia's "shadow fleet" of old tankers used to covertly transport oil. Discussions are underway for an 18th package, potentially targeting gas pipelines and banks. While sanctions have inflicted economic pain on Russia, the economy has rebounded due to military spending and new markets.</p>

          <p>Given the recent surge in gold prices and continued economic uncertainty, it's crucial to approach gold investments strategically. Investors should limit gold to a maximum of 10% of their overall portfolio, steering clear of riskier investment types like gold mining stocks. Instead, consider gold bars, coins, or gold individual retirement accounts. Monitoring the economic climate and portfolio performance is essential to identify potential selling opportunities. Gold serves as an income protector rather than an income producer, making it a valuable tool for diversification and hedging against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at a New Orleans jail has been arrested and charged with helping 10 inmates escape. Sterling Williams, the worker, allegedly shut off water, allowing inmates to remove a toilet and sink fixture from a cell wall. Williams told investigators that an inmate threatened to harm him if he didn't comply. Four escapees have been captured, but six remain at large. The sheriff's office said the escape involved procedural failures and intentional wrongdoings.</p>

Doctors say that many patients have advanced disease despite being diligent about regular prostate screening. Overestimation of the PSA's power as a diagnostic tool is a contributing factor.</p>
