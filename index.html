          <p>Emil Bove, nominated to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, refuting claims by a Justice Department whistleblower that he advised attorneys to disregard court orders. The whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, alleged Bove suggested ignoring potential court orders related to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. Bove, a former defense attorney for President Trump, asserted he has never advised violating court orders, while Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche dismissed the allegations as false. The White House defended Bove's qualifications, emphasizing his commitment to constitutional principles and ending the weaponization of the justice system. Optimism surrounding the nomination remains tempered by the serious nature of the whistleblower's allegations.</p>

          <p>With economic factors like fluctuating inflation, steady unemployment, and high credit card interest rates, consumers are weighing the pros and cons of requesting a credit card limit increase. The article advises against seeking an increase for those already carrying a substantial balance, suggesting they focus on debt relief options instead. Responsible borrowers with little to no debt and a clear budget may consider it, but should be aware of potential credit score impacts and documentation requirements. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual financial circumstances, goals, and the ability to manage increased spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the entire federal judiciary in Maryland, challenging a standing order that prevents the deportation of undocumented immigrants for at least one day after they file a legal challenge. The DOJ argues the order is an unlawful use of equitable powers to restrain the Executive branch. The standing order was issued in response to a surge of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's deportation policies, including the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported and later returned to the U.S. The unusual nature of the lawsuit means no judge in the Maryland district can oversee the case.</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling to care for his two young children after his wife, Paola, was detained by ICE.
