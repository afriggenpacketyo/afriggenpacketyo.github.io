          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features to address concerns about the platform's impact on young users' mental health. The company began testing these features with select teens earlier this year and will now make them available to users of all ages. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and turned on by default for users under 18, interrupting their "For You" feed with guided meditation exercises after 10 p.m. This initiative follows public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to children, posing risks including depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy shrank by an annualized 0.7% in the January-March period, marking its first contraction in a year, according to government data. The decline was attributed to sluggish consumer spending due to inflation and increased import costs, which outweighed growth. This economic slowdown occurred even before U.S. tariffs took full effect, raising concerns about a potential sharp downturn. Economists anticipate further slowing in the April-June quarter, contingent on negotiations with the United States to reduce tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is preparing an economic package to mitigate inflation and the impact of U.S. levies ahead of the House of Councillors election. </p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults, marking the first debate since significant changes were made. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments, including removing the need for a High Court judge's approval for each request. Instead, a panel of experts will oversee the process. MPs are given a free vote on the bill, which has divided Parliament. The government quietly revised its impact assessment, reducing the estimated number of assisted deaths in the first year. Dame Esther Rantzen, campaigning for assisted dying due to her terminal lung cancer, has accused opponents of being influenced by undeclared religious beliefs.</p>

          <p>This article details Cassie's journey to happiness with her husband, Alex Fine, after years of alleged abuse by her ex, Sean "Diddy" Combs. Cassie testified against Diddy in his sex trafficking trial, recounting alleged physical and sexual abuse, including sexual assault. The article highlights the support Fine has shown Cassie, particularly after surveillance video surfaced showing Diddy beating her in a hotel in 2016. Cassie regularly shares photos and videos on social media, showcasing her wholesome family life with Fine and their children. In November 2023, Cassie filed a lawsuit against Diddy, which was settled a day later for $20 million, spurring other alleged victims to come forward.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations are seeking talks with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to address concerns over U.S. tariffs. Many countries originally planned to send vice ministers to the meeting but then changed their minds and sent ministers to push for meetings with Mr. Greer. President Trump imposed tariffs on goods from dozens of countries that he claimed took advantage of the United States by running up trade surpluses, and then suspended the tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations. APEC has slashed its economic outlook for the region from projections made two months earlier, before Mr. Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs, which affect more than half of APEC’s 21 members.</p>

The warm reception and mutual praise signified a stark difference in tone from visits by Biden administration officials.

He lifted sanctions on Syria and met with its new president, Ahmed al-Shara, despite al-Shara's past ties to Al Qaeda. Domestically, Trump has targeted political opponents, former administration members, and news organizations he dislikes. He also aims to invalidate preemptive pardons granted by President Biden. While abroad, Trump expressed admiration for authoritarian leaders and sought a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear standoff, even as he hinted at potential military action.</p>

Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, led by double-digit growth in the Jewellery Maisons division, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros. Despite global uncertainties, Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert highlighted the company's robust performance and the need for agility and discipline. BofA Global Research noted potential headwinds from gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations, but believes the company's pricing power could provide a tailwind.</p>

          <p>Beijing is focusing on reducing China’s vulnerability to external tariff shocks even amid a tentative ceasefire in the country’s trade war with the United States by doubling down on efforts to create a stronger domestic market. Premier Li Qiang said that China would continue to anchor its development strategy in bolstering “domestic circulation” – a concept that refers to strengthening the country’s economic self-reliance by creating a robust, unified domestic market. The country should harness the economy’s “internal stability and long-term growth potential” to “offset rising global uncertainties and keep China’s development on a steady course”.</p>

          <p>A 9½-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, became the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment. The treatment, which has the potential to help people with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases, involved an infusion designed to fix his precise mutation. This approach offers a new path for companies to develop personalized treatments without years of expensive testing. The treatment used pinpoint targeting, base editing and CRISPR to correct a single mutation in the baby's DNA.</p>

Data indicates that following such declines, the S&P 500 has shown strong rebounds within one month and even more substantial gains within one year. The article suggests that despite market corrections and bear markets, long-term optimistic investors tend to benefit, as bull markets typically last much longer than bear markets.</p>

For decades, Chinese-made air-to-air missiles were believed to be imitations of Western designs. But the recent deployment of the PL-15E by the Pakistan Air Force serves as a fresh reminder that the capabilities of China’s air-to-air missile systems – alongside a growing fleet of advanced fighter aircraft – can no longer be ignored. The deployment of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) advanced air-to-air missiles carries broader implications – not only for regional security in the Asia-Pacific, but also for any future Taiwan contingency.</p>

          <p>An extensive genetic analysis has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding new light on the prehistoric human expansion that shaped the early genetic landscape of the western hemisphere. The study found that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. It also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. The work, led by researchers at the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>

The decline was largely due to a fall in exports, which drive the Japanese economy. Data shows demand for exports was waning even before US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs.</p>
