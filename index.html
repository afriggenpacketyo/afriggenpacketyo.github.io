        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Home Office and Treasury in talks about the upcoming Spending Review, Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to embrace change and modernization. Kyle acknowledged financial pressures across society, including demands from doctors and universities, but emphasized the government's commitment to investing in schools and scientific research. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns over potential police budget cuts, while Kyle noted the government has already allocated an additional Â£1 billion to policing, stressing the need for reform and technological upgrades. Police chiefs have previously warned that outdated technology is causing structural inefficiencies, with Reform UK advocating for reduced government spending across the board.</p>

          <p>Health workers in Gaza reported that at least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire while approaching an aid distribution center. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that warning shots were fired after a verbal challenge to a group deemed a threat, though they acknowledged awareness of injury reports with numbers inconsistent with their information. This incident occurred near a distribution point established by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by Israel and the US. The IDF has declared that movement to and from GHF sites should only occur between 6:00 and 18:00 local time, considering all other times an active combat zone.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on how, during the Cold War, China was wary of American efforts to subvert the Communist Party through "peaceful evolution." Mao Zedong cautioned against the influence of Western values, especially after three generations. Now, China is a global economic power, while the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building. The author suggests that under Trump's leadership, the U.S. has lost its ability to influence China's political and social development, marking a significant shift in global power dynamics.</p>

          <p>This poem reflects on the insignificance of grand ambitions when compared to the appreciation of life's simple beauties. The speaker contrasts the desire to explore the cosmos or the ocean's depths with finding joy in the minutiae of everyday existence. References to nature, like gold flares in cottonwood leaves and the smell of piÃ±on, highlight the beauty in the ordinary. The poem concludes with an understanding of life's explosive and generative nature, finding contentment in perseverance and simple observations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over federal immigration enforcement operations. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness stemming from these demonstrations. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's decision, calling it an inflammatory move that will escalate tensions.

Donald Trump's frequent golfing and integration of business into his game contrast with predecessors like William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, who preferred separation between work and leisure. Dwight Eisenhower faced criticism for his golfing habits but enjoyed the game without mixing it with business, while others like Bill Clinton used the golf course for networking. The article also recounts instances where golf was interrupted by serious national events, impacting presidential decisions and public perception.</p>

Gingrich uses the book to settle old scores with establishment Republicans, highlighting his long-standing resentment towards figures like George H.W. Bush and Mitt Romney.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, with a significant portion nearing retirement, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, offering competitive wages and on-the-job training, yet challenges remain in filling these critical positions. High-value sectors like aviation are more likely to retain jobs in the U.S., but worker shortages and geographical immobility pose obstacles to meeting demand.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the journey of a story about an American football team in Chongqing, China, from a magazine article to Hollywood development and eventual Chinese production. The author reflects on the initial optimism surrounding US-China relations when the story was first published, leading to interest from Hollywood studios. However, as relations soured and China's film industry grew, the story was eventually adapted by a Chinese studio, reflecting a shift in cultural influence. The author observes that the Chinese adaptation, while borrowing the premise, tells a different story that reflects a more nationalistic perspective.</p>

          <p>This article examines Barack Obama's activities in his post-presidency, contrasting his relaxed lifestyle with the ongoing political turmoil under Donald Trump. While Trump faces scrutiny for his policies, Obama is criticized for his perceived detachment, which some view as incongruous with the desperation of his admirers. Despite occasional political statements and fundraising efforts, Obama primarily focuses on personal interests and his foundation's work, leading some to question whether he is fulfilling his potential as a voice of opposition. Some argue that Obama's reluctance to engage more directly in politics is a disservice to his legacy and the needs of the Democratic Party.</p>

The bill slashes food assistance and Medicaid, leaving millions uninsured and exacerbating economic inequality.

          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum on potential changes to citizenship and labor laws, initiated by an NGO-led grassroots campaign. The vote includes questions on easing citizenship requirements for children born to foreigners and increasing worker protections against dismissal. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain, hoping to prevent the 50% turnout needed for the results to be binding. Campaigners for the citizenship law change argue it would aid integration for second-generation Italians and align Italy with other European nations.</p>

          <p>Tinder's trial of a height filter for premium users has ignited mixed reactions, with some worrying it could limit connections and others believing it could help shorter men find matches. While some daters consider height a deal-breaker, others prioritize personality and shared interests. The feature, available only to paid subscribers in select regions, informs the app's matching algorithm based on user preferences rather than filtering out users entirely. Experts say the filter may offer shorter men some reassurance, and could help people avoid women who only want to date really tall men.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget includes cuts to Pell Grants, which could significantly impact college access for low-income students. The maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 academic year would be at its lowest level in over a decade, potentially increasing student debt and forcing some to drop out. Experts warn that these cuts would disproportionately affect the lowest-income families, as over 92% of Pell Grant recipients come from households with incomes below $60,000. While the Pell program functions like other entitlement programs, it relies on discretionary funding, making it vulnerable to budget cuts.</p>
