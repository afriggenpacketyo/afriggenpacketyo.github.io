          <p>The Trump administration's 50% copper tariff surprised markets by exempting raw materials like copper cathode, causing a sharp drop in U.S. futures prices. However, the tariff still applies to semi-finished products such as pipes, wires, and sheets, which are direct inputs for many consumer goods. Analysts predict that manufacturers of items like air conditioners, plumbing parts, and electronics will pass these increased costs on to consumers. The policy highlights the complexities of trade interventions and their nuanced effects on both commodity markets and household expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft reported stronger-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, causing its stock to rise significantly in after-hours trading. The company's revenue grew 18%, its fastest rate in over three years, largely driven by its Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes the Azure platform. For the first time, Microsoft disclosed that Azure's annual revenue exceeded $75 billion, a 34% increase from the previous year. The robust performance, fueled by AI investments and strong demand for cloud services, has pushed Microsoft's market capitalization towards the $4 trillion mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Irish court has dismissed Conor McGregor's appeal against a civil jury's finding that he sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel in 2018. The former MMA fighter had been ordered to pay £206,000 in damages to Nikita Hand. McGregor's legal team appealed on the grounds that his police interviews should not have been presented to the jury and that a question on the jury's issue paper was improperly worded. However, the three-judge Court of Appeal panel rejected these arguments, upholding the original verdict in its entirety.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering a case that could significantly impact President Trump's ability to impose sweeping global tariffs. The lawsuit, V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, argues that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement his "reciprocal" tariff plan. Plaintiffs contend that the power to set tariffs constitutionally belongs to Congress, not the executive branch. The outcome of this legal battle is critical, as many of Trump's tariffs are scheduled to take effect, potentially altering the landscape of U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif argues for the creation of a Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement (Menara). He proposes this regional body to foster peaceful nuclear cooperation among nations in the Middle East and North Africa, based on a commitment to reject nuclear weapons. Zarif contends that this approach can build trust and provide a new path forward, rather than waiting for Israeli disarmament, which has stalled progress. The initiative aims to reframe the nuclear issue from one of risk to one of shared opportunity.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig. Prosecutors demonstrated that Craig, who was having an affair and facing financial difficulties, poisoned his wife's protein shakes with arsenic before administering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in the hospital. The defense argued that his wife died by suicide, but evidence showed Craig had researched poisons and had potassium cyanide delivered to his dental office. The jury convicted him of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast has announced he will run for a fourth term in the upcoming election, a move made possible by constitutional changes he implemented in 2016 that reset term limits. The 83-year-old's decision, which he justified by citing ongoing security and economic challenges, has drawn sharp criticism from the opposition, who view it as a breach of the constitution. The announcement intensifies an already fraught political climate, as several key opposition leaders have been barred from running, raising concerns about the fairness of the election and potential for unrest.</p>

The report highlighted a "reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight" and a fragmented care record as key issues.

The Commerce Department report showed notable monthly price increases for heavily imported items like furniture, appliances, and computers. This uptick in inflation helps explain the Federal Reserve's decision to hold its key interest rate steady, despite pressure for a cut.
