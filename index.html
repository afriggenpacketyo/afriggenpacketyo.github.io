          <p>SK Hynix, a major memory chip supplier, reported significantly increased quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by robust demand for high-bandwidth memory used in AI chipsets.  While the first quarter showed a year-on-year surge in profits, there was a quarter-on-quarter decline.  The company cautioned about potential demand volatility due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including US tariff policies.  Despite these concerns, SK Hynix anticipates continued growth in AI server demand, fueled by increased spending from Big Tech and the expansion of the AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Foreign nationals in Japan who overstay their visas face harsh consequences, including detention and deportation, raising questions about the criminalization of immigration violations.  Many overstayers are seeking employment, often in labor or agriculture, and are not involved in other criminal activities.  While authorities emphasize their focus on those who violate immigration laws, critics argue that overstaying should not be equated with other criminal offenses.  International organizations advocate for more humane terminology and alternative approaches to address irregular immigration.</p>

          <p>A bill proposed by Assemblymember Lisa Calderon to reduce California's rooftop solar energy credits has sparked intense opposition from solar owners, environmental groups, and solar installers.  Calderon, a former Southern California Edison executive, argues the current system unfairly burdens non-solar users with higher electric bills.  Opponents contend that the state previously guaranteed 20-year contracts for these credits and that the bill unfairly penalizes those who invested in solar energy.  The debate highlights the complex interplay between energy policy, consumer interests, and the influence of utility companies.</p>
