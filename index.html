          <h2>Delta Air Lines Exceeds Summer Estimates Amid Strong Premium Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:35:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, buoyed by robust sales of premium seats and its lucrative American Express partnership. Despite this strong performance, the carrier has lowered its full-year profit forecast for 2025, acknowledging weaker-than-anticipated overall demand and an industry-wide oversupply of flights. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while consumer travel continues, booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, prompting the airline to strategically reduce flight capacity after the summer peak. The airline's reliance on higher-spending travelers is helping to counteract the decline in main cabin revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:35:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's postal regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays and move to an every-other-weekday schedule to reduce costs. This reform comes as letter volume has plummeted from 20 billion in 2004 to 6.6 billion today, causing significant financial losses for the service. While Royal Mail welcomed the change as a necessary step for financial sustainability, the decision has drawn criticism from consumer groups and businesses concerned about service degradation and reliance on more expensive first-class mail. First-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week, but with slightly relaxed delivery targets.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, has been rescued after he went missing while surfing and spent a night stranded on North Solitary Island, a small, uninhabited island located miles offshore. A large-scale search was initiated after he failed to return home, with his father making an emotional plea on social media for assistance. Deefholts was found the following day and was receiving medical treatment. His father described the successful rescue as a "one in a million miracle," expressing immense relief after fearing the worst had happened to his son.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a massive $75 billion funding increase for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), signaling a dramatic escalation of its immigration enforcement agenda. This financial infusion will more than double immigration detention capacity and provide a blank check for enforcement and deportation activities. Critics and civil rights advocates express deep concern that the funding will enable indiscriminate tactics, undermine due process, and infringe on civil liberties for both immigrants and citizens. Despite the administration's goals, practical obstacles such as hiring time and international cooperation may still limit the scale of deportations.</p>

          <p>A soldier was killed and two others were wounded in northwest Colombia when a bomb strapped to a donkey exploded. The attack, which occurred in the Antioquia department, has been attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group. The incident highlights the escalating violence in the country following the suspension of peace talks between the government and the ELN. Antioquia's governor condemned the attack, criticizing the government's pursuit of "total peace" while armed groups continue to operate with impunity and intensify their assaults on security forces.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is bracing for its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecast to climb as high as 34°C (93°F) over the weekend. In response, the UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat-health alerts for all regions of England, warning of potential significant impacts on health and social care services. While the heat will be widespread, it is unlikely to surpass the year's current high of 35.8°C. Climate scientists emphasize that such heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, posing long-term threats to wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the nation faces a "rising" and highly unpredictable threat from Iran, encompassing espionage, cyber attacks, and physical violence. The Intelligence and Security Committee's report highlights a sharp increase in assassination and kidnapping plots against opponents of the Iranian regime on British soil since 2022. The committee criticized the government for focusing too heavily on crisis management and Iran's nuclear program, urging a more strategic, long-term approach to counter the full spectrum of threats. The report notes that Iran's intelligence services are well-resourced and have a high appetite for risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) in California could fundamentally alter its political dynamics, drawing comparisons to its recent use in New York City. Proponents argue RCV saves money by eliminating runoffs, increases diversity, and discourages negative campaigning. In California's top-two primary system, RCV could give underrepresented parties a better chance in competitive races and might reduce the incentive for candidates to strategically switch parties. The system could also lead to more centrist outcomes through crossover voting or, conversely, push candidates to extremes to capture second-choice votes, presenting a complex but potentially beneficial reform.</p>

One victim detailed how he reported an incident in 1986, yet the priest was later promoted, raising serious questions about the Church's safeguarding procedures and its failure to act on credible warnings.</p>

This local effort is seen as part of a broader GOP strategy to offset potential losses in other states and counteract the state's shifting demographics, which have shown increasing support for Democrats.</p>

          <p>A new poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies reveals that a vast majority of California voters, 90%, believe American democracy is either under attack or being severely tested. This sentiment cuts across all partisan, demographic, and geographic lines, with 64% of all voters stating democracy is "under attack." While Democrats were the most fearful, a significant number of Republicans also expressed unease, reflecting pervasive concern over the nation's political stability. Experts suggest these fears are rooted in long-term trends and recent events, including baseless election fraud claims and the perceived weaponization of government institutions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 100th anniversary of the Scopes "Monkey Trial," a landmark courtroom battle between evolution and creationism. While defense attorney Clarence Darrow's cross-examination of prosecutor William Jennings Bryan is often seen as a victory for science, the author argues that the underlying cultural conflict persists today. The article traces the evolution of creationism into "intelligent design" and connects the historical debate to modern attacks on science and public education. It concludes that a century later, the fundamental tensions between modernism and fundamentalism that defined the Scopes trial are still very much alive in American society.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that while the recently signed federal spending bill has many flaws, it gets one thing right by expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). The author praises HSAs as a rare, bipartisan policy that promotes individual responsibility and can help reduce healthcare costs. The new bill makes several positive changes, including allowing individuals with certain Affordable Care Act plans to contribute to HSAs and permitting HSA funds to be used for direct primary care memberships. While more reforms are needed, the article views these expansions as a significant and popular policy achievement.</p>

          <p>Six months after the historic Palisades and Eaton fires, Los Angeles County is facing a recovery of unparalleled scale, marked by both tangible progress and profound, lingering loss. While officials report that debris removal from thousands of properties is months ahead of schedule, many of the 30,000 displaced residents are still battling insurance companies and navigating a complex rebuilding process. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the recovery, covering the massive cleanup effort, the slow pace of rebuilding permits, the ongoing investigations into the fires' causes, and the wave of litigation against utilities and insurers.</p>

          <p>In a fortunate outcome, all 31 workers trapped after a tunnel collapse in a Los Angeles industrial complex were rescued safely on Wednesday evening. The collapse occurred in an 18-foot diameter wastewater management tunnel under construction, leaving the workers stranded behind a large pile of soil and debris. The crew was able to climb over the pile to meet coworkers on the other side, who then shuttled them out to the access point over five miles away. More than 100 firefighters responded, with officials calling the successful rescue with no injuries a major blessing for the city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel for their roles in the security failures during an assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. A senior official acknowledged the event as an "operational failure" and confirmed that penalties ranging from 10 to 42 days of unpaid leave were issued. The attack, where a gunman fired at Trump, resulted in the death of an attendee and prompted the resignation of the agency's director. This disciplinary action follows congressional reports that identified significant security lapses, including the failure to secure the rooftop from which the gunman opened fire.</p>

          <p>Years before a catastrophic flood killed over 90 people, officials in Kerr County, Texas, knew they needed a modern flood warning system but struggled to fund it. Their applications for federal FEMA grants were denied, and a state program would have required the county to cover 95% of the cost, which was unfeasible. This local struggle exemplifies a national problem for communities at risk, which is now being exacerbated by the Trump administration's freezing and cancellation of billions in federal disaster preparedness funds. The administration's policy shifts responsibility to states, leaving a significant funding gap for critical life-saving infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a zonal electricity pricing system, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographic location. Instead, it will focus on reforming the current national pricing model. Proponents of zonal pricing argued it could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland, but some major energy firms warned it could deter investment in renewable projects. The industry group Energy UK welcomed the decision for providing policy clarity, though critics maintain that simply sticking with the current system will not resolve the deep-rooted issues within Great Britain's electricity market.</p>

          <p>During the catastrophic flash flood in Texas' Hill Country, officials in Kerr County waited 90 minutes to issue an emergency alert after a firefighter urgently requested one, according to dispatch audio. As the Guadalupe River began to surge, a firefighter reported a key landmark was underwater and asked for a CodeRED alert to be sent to residents, but a dispatcher replied that supervisor approval was needed. The first alert was not sent until an hour and a half later, by which time the floodwaters had already become deadly.

The city council has voted to send contractors to dismantle the structure due to its proximity to a major electricity substation that powers two hospitals, raising fears of power outages. The situation is tense, as loyalist activists have vowed legal action to prevent the bonfire's removal and there are concerns that any police operation to assist could trigger widespread disorder.

However, the kindness of two stadium employees, who provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter area, transformed the experience.

He criticized Democrats for not making climate a top talking point and Republicans for being captured by industry interests following the Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
