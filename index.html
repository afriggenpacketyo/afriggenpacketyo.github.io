        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK health officials have reported the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, although they emphasize that the risk to the general public remains very low. The virus, typically spread among birds, can infect humans through mosquito bites, potentially causing minor symptoms or, in rare instances, severe brain illnesses. This discovery aligns with the broader trend of mosquito-borne diseases expanding into new regions due to climate change. The UK Health Security Agency and the Animal and Plant Health Agency identified fragments of the virus in mosquitoes collected near Retford, Nottinghamshire, indicating a changing landscape for infectious diseases in the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have proposed eliminating federal taxes on tips, a seemingly populist idea that has garnered support from industry lobbyists. However, experts argue that this policy could primarily benefit businesses rather than workers by reducing the pressure to raise baseline wages. While tipped workers might see a slight increase in take-home pay, the proposal could disincentivize employers from offering competitive wages. Instead, experts suggest focusing on policies like abolishing the subminimum wage to ensure service sector workers receive a fair and livable income. (not investment advice)</p>

Her rise has sparked controversy, with some questioning her scientific rigor and others praising her dedication to making America's food healthier.

While presidents aren't required to disclose health records, this situation has reignited discussions about the transparency of presidential health and the role of regular screenings.

          <p>Toyota Motor announced that the top-selling RAV4 SUV in the United States will be exclusively offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign. The 2026 Toyota RAV4 will eliminate the traditional gas engine, offering only hybrid or plug-in hybrid options. This decision aligns with the growing customer demand for hybrids and Toyota's commitment to electrified vehicles. The company's electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of its domestic sales in 2024, with RAV4 hybrid sales increasing significantly.</p>

          <p>Target CEO Brian Cornell cautioned that tariffs pose "massive potential costs" and that the company would only raise prices as a "very last resort." This warning follows similar statements from Walmart and Best Buy. Target reported a drop in sales, attributing it to consumer concerns over tariffs and a boycott related to the company's DEI rollback. Consumer sentiment has soured, partly due to inflation fears and recession warnings triggered by President Trump's tariff policies. A recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has eased some tariff pressures, but uncertainty remains.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas, with $56 billion allocated to overseas LNG projects. This contradicts Japan's role in leading the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which aims to promote net-zero emissions in Asia. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves significant greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's strengthened cybercrime laws, particularly the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), are drawing criticism for allegedly silencing critical voices, especially journalists. The amended law criminalizes the dissemination of false information online, leading to arrests and charges against journalists reporting on sensitive issues. Press freedom groups are concerned about the lack of consultation before enacting these strict laws. While the government claims the law is necessary to limit disinformation, critics argue it controls the narrative and stifles independent journalism.</p>

The project, estimated to cost around $175 billion, aims to create a comprehensive missile defense umbrella capable of intercepting missiles from anywhere, including space.
