          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former President Trump questioned why Vladimir Putin would continue military actions in Ukraine while the U.S. is attempting to broker peace. Trump suggested that Putin may not want to stop the war and might need to be dealt with more firmly, potentially through increased sanctions. This stance offers a glimmer of hope to Ukrainians wary of a U.S.-backed peace plan that would require Ukraine to concede territory and abandon NATO aspirations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who were legally in the U.S., criticizing the government's evidence linking them to a gang. Judge David Briones, a Clinton appointee, accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support their claims. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and released multiple times before their TPS status was withdrawn due to alleged association with a Foreign Terrorist Organization.</p>
