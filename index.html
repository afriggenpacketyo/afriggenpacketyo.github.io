          <p>ABC News has suspended senior national correspondent Terry Moran after he posted a since-deleted social media message criticizing White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and President Trump. Moran's post described Miller as "richly endowed with the capacity for hatred" and a "world-class hater," while claiming Trump's hatred is a means to self-glorification. The network stated that Moran's post violated their standards for objectivity and impartiality, prompting the suspension pending further evaluation. The White House responded strongly, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling Moran's comments "unhinged and unacceptable," and Vice President JD Vance calling Moran's post a "vile smear".

Former Sunderland boss Tony Mowbray noted Jobe's desire to create his own headlines and not live off his brother's name. While Jude operates as an attacking midfielder, Jobe is versatile and can play as a defensive or box-to-box midfielder. His move to Germany is seen as a positive step, offering a balance between the Championship and the Premier League, with former Sunderland striker Marco Gabbiadini suggesting it could alleviate some pressure and offer financial advantages. Jobe's potential is recognized, with comparisons to his brother tempered by the acknowledgment that even being 80% as good would make him a very good footballer.</p>

Despite local law enforcement reporting peaceful demonstrations, Trump has characterized the situation as chaotic and a threat to federal law enforcement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples' relationships has identified the five most common sources of conflict: tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The tone of voice or attitude is the most frequent trigger, often signaling contempt, a significant predictor of divorce. Family relations disputes reflect underlying misalignments and unmet needs, while chore-related arguments stem from the unequal distribution of labor. Communication style conflicts are tricky to navigate, with the original issue often lost in translation. The psychologist suggests strategies such as naming the effect of condescending tones, reassuring partners, acknowledging the invisible load, and using a designated word or phrase for time-outs.</p>

          <p>The Major League Soccer Playersâ€™ Association (MLSPA) has criticized MLSâ€™s proposal for distributing Club World Cup prize money, deeming the 20% payout "below the international standard." MLS proposed that players receive 20% of performance-based prize money at each tournament stage, without a cap, while the current CBA structure allots players half of any prize money with a $1 million cap. The MLSPA also alleges that the league attempted to "strong-arm" players into CBA waivers unrelated to the Club World Cup. The Seattle Sounders protested the prize money structure, wearing T-shirts reading "Club World Cup Cash Grab", indicating growing player dissatisfaction with the league's offer. The Club World Cup is set to begin on June 16 in the United States, featuring MLS teams such as the Seattle Sounders, Inter Miami, and Los Angeles FC.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that a Costco membership card is not an acceptable form of identification for air travel. This clarification comes as travelers prepare for increased security measures and the need for Real ID compliance. The agency humorously stated, "Canâ€™t fly on hot dogs and hope," emphasizing the importance of having proper identification. Travelers are encouraged to ensure they have valid government-issued identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to pass through airport security.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister has declared that the country will prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. The minister stated that Israel will not allow anyone to break its naval blockade, which it claims is necessary to prevent Hamas from importing arms. Thunberg and other activists are aboard the Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which aims to end Israel's blockade of Gaza. The coalition has accused Israel of jamming their communication as they approached Gaza, while Israel maintains its right to defend its blockade. The situation remains tense as the vessel approaches Gaza's territorial waters.</p>

Online safety campaigner Ian Russell criticized the government's delays in enacting tougher laws to protect children. While parental controls and app-based time limits already exist, their effectiveness is questioned due to low parental take-up and the overwhelming number of options.</p>

          <p>President Trump is accused of intentionally provoking unrest in Los Angeles by deploying the National Guard to confront immigration protests. Critics argue that Trump aims to create a spectacle of public violence to justify using armed force against Americans and expand presidential power. The move is seen as a way to divert attention from his failures and establish a strongman image, potentially setting a precedent for suppressing future dissent. The article suggests that the most effective response is restraint, denying Trump the desired conflict and undermining his attempts to create a national emergency for authoritarian control.</p>

The order signaled Trump's intent to revive the controversial travel ban, a key immigration policy from his first term. The ban is expected to face legal challenges and further scrutiny from civil rights organizations.</p>
