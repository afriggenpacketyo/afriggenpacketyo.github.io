        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British start-up Better Dairy is among several companies developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation, a process where genetically modified yeast produces milk proteins. This technology aims to create cheese that tastes authentic without involving animals, addressing the quality gap in current vegan cheese options. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales and consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, these firms are targeting a "silent revolution" by first entering the market in products like frozen pizzas. The success of this venture will depend on overcoming challenges related to taste, price, and regulatory approval in markets like the EU.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, Jess Basey-Fisher, successfully located her long-lost older brother after learning of his existence from her father following her mother's death. Her mother had given the baby up for adoption in 1962 after a relationship with a man from a US airbase. Using ancestry websites, Jess found her brother, Alistair, living in Australia, discovering remarkable parallels in their lives as both were raised by a doctor and a nurse. Their reunion was made more poignant and urgent when Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer shortly after they first connected, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers toured the controversial new migrant detention facility known as 'Alligator Alcatraz' after weeks of being denied access. Democratic representatives reported 'appalling' conditions, citing extreme heat up to 85 degrees in the medical area, limited food, and claims from detainees about poor water access. In contrast, Republican lawmakers expressed satisfaction with the facility, with one senator calling the beds more comfortable than his own. The visit follows lawsuits and public protest over allegations of inhumane treatment, which state officials have consistently denied as false.</p>

          <p>A former lumberjack and a teenager have spoken out about being wrongly arrested and publicly accused of felling the iconic Sycamore Gap tree. Both individuals faced intense online abuse and media scrutiny after their names were linked to the crime, forcing one to wear a disguise to avoid public harassment. They were eventually exonerated by police, who later convicted two other men for the act of vandalism. The article highlights the damaging impact of trial by social media and the personal toll of being falsely implicated in a high-profile case.</p>

          <p>A region in southern Italy has ignited controversy by inviting Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a known ally of Vladimir Putin, to perform at a festival. This marks his first major European appearance since being barred from stages following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invitation has drawn sharp criticism from a European Parliament vice-president and Ukrainian activists, who label Gergiev a 'cultural mouthpiece for Putin.' The event's organizers defend the decision on the grounds of separating culture from politics, creating a tense debate over artistic freedom versus accountability for supporting the Kremlin's actions.</p>

          <p>The UK's remaining steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are grappling with a deepening crisis fueled by high energy costs, decarbonization pressures, and the looming threat of US tariffs. The industry has seen a dramatic decline from its peak, leading to significant job losses and economic hardship in communities historically dependent on steel production. While there are efforts to redevelop these 'rust belt' areas with green industries, the transition is challenging for former steelworkers. The ongoing uncertainty over a 25% US tariff on UK steel adds another layer of instability to the struggling sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign, following a controversial decision by the Justice Department to close its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's associates. The rumors emerged amid backlash from hardline critics who were disappointed that the investigation did not produce a so-called 'client list' or evidence of blackmail. A joint FBI-DOJ memo concluded there was no credible evidence to predicate new investigations against uncharged third parties. Despite denials of a rift, reports suggest significant internal anger over the decision, fueled by persistent conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor retained her undisputed super lightweight titles by defeating Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano in their third and final bout at Madison Square Garden. Taylor secured the victory by a majority decision, with two judges scoring the fight 97-93 in her favor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. This win provides a decisive conclusion to their highly anticipated trilogy, which began in 2022. Unlike the previous two close contests, this third fight was marked by a more pronounced and clear dominance from Taylor.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash, relatives of the 260 victims are calling for a full investigation to establish accountability. The initial findings revealed that the plane's fuel control switches were moved to the 'cut-off' position shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, causing both engines to fail. A granddaughter of one of the victims described the report as incomplete and heartbreaking, stating that she and other families cannot find peace or closure until the root cause of the tragedy is fully known and responsibility is assigned.</p>

          <p>The murder trial of Erin Patterson, convicted of killing three family members with poisonous mushrooms, has become a true crime obsession in Australia and beyond. The case, held in a small rural courtroom, drew international media, podcasters, and daily spectators. Ironically, Patterson herself was known as a 'super sleuth' in online true crime communities before she became the subject of one. The seemingly benign setting of a family lunch, combined with the unusual method of murder, has fueled intense public fascination and speculation that continues even after her conviction.</p>

          <p>Germany has progressed to the knockout stage of Euro 2025, but their 4-1 group stage loss to Sweden has exposed serious defensive vulnerabilities. After taking an early lead, the German defense collapsed, conceding three goals in quick succession due to individual errors and a lack of organization. The team's performance has raised concerns about its ability to compete against top-tier opponents in the quarter-finals. Coach Christian Wück now faces significant tactical and personnel decisions to address these defensive frailties if Germany hopes to advance further in the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new book, '2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,' offers a deeply sourced analysis of the recent U.S. presidential election. Written by a team of journalists, the book chronicles how Donald Trump's restoration was made possible by a combination of his populist appeal and the strategic failures of the Democratic party. It argues that decades of public frustration with institutional failures created an environment where voters identified with Trump's legal battles. The review praises the book for its detailed reporting on the delusions and missteps of both campaigns, painting an anxious picture of American democracy.</p>

In his assessment, while there may be scope for negotiation in specific sectors like technology, the broad-based tariff will probably not be removed. This confirmation of a challenging trade environment comes as the UK also faces continued uncertainty over a separate 25% tariff on its steel exports, and as the US announced new 30% tariffs against the EU and Mexico.

          <p>President Trump stated on social media that he is giving 'serious consideration' to revoking the U.S. citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, a long-time public critic. This threat was made despite O'Donnell being a native-born U.S. citizen, which grants her a constitutional right to citizenship that cannot be unilaterally revoked by the government. Legal experts quickly noted that a 1967 Supreme Court ruling explicitly prohibits such an action. The statement is the latest instance of the president targeting a political opponent with threats that challenge established legal and constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>A dramatic end to the third day of the Test match between England and India at Lord's was marked by controversy over time-wasting. England's opening batters, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, successfully used delay tactics, including calling for a physio, to ensure they only had to face one over before the close of play instead of two. The move angered India's players, but England's bowling coach defended the strategy, pointing to similar delays by the Indian team earlier in the match. The incident added another layer of tension to the closely fought contest.</p>

The page clarifies that costs are not taxpayer-funded, explains budget increases, and refutes claims about 'VIP private dining rooms.' This public defense is a sign of the central bank gearing up to fight the administration's campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
