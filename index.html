          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks for his finances. He asserted this was part of a broader trend of financial institutions discriminating against conservative clients, a practice known as "de-banking." In response to these concerns, the Trump administration is reportedly preparing an executive order to penalize banks for dropping customers based on political views. JPMorgan stated it does not close accounts for political reasons and agreed that regulatory changes are needed to address the issue.</p>

The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The updated forecast now projects an adjusted profit between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive outlook comes as the company navigates potential impacts from President Trump's demands for lower drug prices and proposed tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.

          <p>Fox Corp. has announced the launch of its direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, which will debut on August 21 for $19.99 per month. The service will offer the company's full portfolio, including live sports from the Fox broadcast network and news programming from Fox News and Fox Business, without any exclusive original content. CEO Lachlan Murdoch stated that subscriber expectations are modest and the pricing is designed to avoid further disruption to the traditional pay-TV bundle. The move marks Fox's entry into the comprehensive streaming market, following a different strategy than competitors who invest heavily in streaming-exclusive content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was a preventable tragedy caused by OceanGate's use of "intimidation tactics" to bypass regulatory oversight. The comprehensive report details how the company operated outside established deep-sea protocols, ignored warnings about hull integrity, and fostered a "toxic" safety culture. Investigators largely blamed CEO Stockton Rush, stating his overconfidence and negligence contributed directly to the deaths of the four other individuals aboard the vessel. The findings serve as a stark lesson on the consequences of disregarding fundamental engineering and safety principles in hazardous environments.</p>

Advisors suggest that the choice between a short-term and long-term CD should depend on an individual's financial timeline and goals, rather than attempts to time the market. For those uncertain, a CD laddering strategy is recommended to balance flexibility with the ability to secure favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his economic pressure campaign, stating that Russia's economy "stinks" and that lower oil prices are necessary to cripple its war efforts in Ukraine. He also threatened to substantially increase tariffs on India for purchasing discounted Russian oil, accusing New Delhi of fueling the conflict. This rhetoric marks a souring of relations between Washington and Moscow, with Trump recently shortening a deadline for Russia to reach a peace deal. The Kremlin responded by defending India's right to choose its trade partners and calling the U.S. tariff threats illegitimate attempts to force compliance.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly linked to a 62% jump in screenings for this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. Health experts view this as positive news, as early detection makes the cancer highly curable, with a survival rate of over 90% in its earliest stages. While the trend is promising, researchers emphasize that screening rates remain suboptimal and continued efforts are needed to ensure equitable access.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. tariff threats against India, analysts suggest that China could be the next country to face economic pressure for purchasing Russian oil. Despite the risk of secondary sanctions, experts believe Beijing is unlikely to cease its energy cooperation with Moscow, as a stable resource supply is a key strategic goal. Russia has become China's top crude oil supplier, with imports increasing significantly since 2022. This places China in a similar position to India, which President Trump has criticized for fueling Russia's war machine, signaling a potential expansion of the U.S. economic campaign.</p>

          <p>The strategic partnership between the United States and India is facing significant strain due to President Trump's economic pressure tactics. Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Indian exports and threatened further increases if New Delhi does not cease its oil imports from Russia and trade with Iran. India has defended its sovereign right to maintain its time-tested partnership with Russia and has called the US tariffs unjustified. Analysts suggest that while India does not seek confrontation, the White House's abrasive approach is eroding trust and pushing New Delhi to navigate the crisis through careful diplomacy.</p>

          <p>An extensive search operation is in progress for Alec Luhn, an award-winning American climate journalist who went missing during a solo backpacking trip on a glacier in southwestern Norway. Luhn, an experienced outdoorsman, was last heard from on July 31 and failed to return for his flight home on Monday. His family reported him missing after being unable to make contact, prompting a rescue effort that has been partially hindered by poor weather.

          <p>As Japan commemorates the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, efforts are intensifying to preserve the stories of the aging survivors, known as 'hibakusha.' With the number of living survivors dwindling, museums and a new generation of 'successors' are working to convey the horrors of nuclear weapons to prevent their future use. One such successor, a 12-year-old boy, guides foreign tourists and shares his great-grandmother's story to ensure the message of peace is passed on. The memorials underscore a pressing concern about the rising global risk of nuclear conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compiles several instances where President Trump has commented on the possibility of seeking a third presidential term, despite the constitutional two-term limit. While Trump has often joked about running again, suggesting he might be "entitled" to it or that "there are methods," he has also downplayed the idea, recently stating he would be a "two-term president." His remarks have fueled speculation and prompted allies to propose constitutional amendments. Experts suggest this talk may be a political tactic to maintain influence and counter the perception of being a lame-duck president.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup report reveals that Gen Z employees are the least likely generation to favor fully remote work, with only 23% preferring it compared to 35% of older generations. Instead, 71% of Gen Z workers favor a hybrid model, expressing a desire for more in-person connection and mentorship opportunities that they feel are compromised in a fully remote setting. The study suggests that loneliness and a need to understand their role within the broader organization are key drivers for this preference. The findings challenge assumptions about the youngest generation's work preferences and highlight the importance of structured in-person interaction for career development.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is sounding the alarm on a severe hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, where an estimated 5 million children are suffering from acute malnutrition. The crisis is driven by a combination of protracted insecurity from jihadist groups and banditry, which prevents farmers from cultivating land, and critical funding shortfalls for aid organizations like the World Food Programme. Displaced villagers are unable to return to their farms, cutting them off from their primary livelihoods. Analysts argue the root cause is a failure of governance and security, making the region dangerously food insecure despite being a traditional agricultural hub.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the renewed diplomatic interest in the Russia-India-China (RIC) trilateral forum and its potential implications for Asian stability. For Russia, isolated by the West, reviving the group is a way to demonstrate it still has powerful partners and to balance its increasing reliance on China. For China, stabilizing its continental flank with India is a strategic priority as it focuses on maritime goals. India remains cautious, balancing its strategic autonomy with the potential benefits of the forum. The piece questions whether this renewed engagement can lead to genuine cooperation or is merely strategic posturing.</p>

One woman, Andrea Velez, was heading to work when she was detained and charged with assaulting an officer, a felony case that was later dismissed. Another man, Adrian Martinez, was arrested while objecting to the detention of a janitor and subsequently lost his job. These incidents highlight a pattern of haphazard arrests and aggressive prosecutions by federal authorities, raising serious concerns about civil rights and government overreach.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven £100,000 awards, are currently unclaimed in the United Kingdom. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its process for tracing winners, which can be difficult for those with old paper records or gifted bonds. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes and offers a tracing service, some find the system too rigid. The issue has prompted calls for a new awareness campaign to help reunite winners with their money, especially during the ongoing cost of living crisis.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile and disruptive audience during a town hall in Lincoln. The crowd repeatedly heckled and booed the congressman as he attempted to defend his support for a major policy and tax bill signed by President Trump. The primary points of contention were the bill's changes to Medicaid and its tax provisions, with audience members chanting "Tax the Rich!" Flood argued the bill was a middle-class tax cut and that its Medicaid reforms rightly targeted able-bodied adults who refuse to work, but his explanations failed to placate the angry constituents.</p>
