          <h2>Scientists Link Stronger Typhoons Like Ragasa to Climate Change</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 05:31:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are warning that climate change is fueling the creation of more frequent and powerful super typhoons, such as the recent Typhoon Ragasa. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy, allowing storms to intensify more rapidly and stall over coastlines, leading to catastrophic rainfall. According to experts cited in the article, this trend is a direct consequence of rising sea temperatures, with the Pacific Ocean warming by approximately 1.5 degrees Celsius over the last century.</p>

As a progressive Democrat, she will be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress, and her victory narrows the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

The company saw sales at established stores drop across all regions, with North America and the UK being the most affected. In response to the challenging economic environment and rising operating costs, the sportswear giant is focusing on cost-saving measures and optimizing its store locations to improve performance.

Trump stated on social media that he now believes Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory, citing Russia's struggling economy as a key factor. This marks a significant departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory to achieve peace, a pivot Zelenskyy described as a "big shift."</p>

          <p>After causing 14 fatalities in Taiwan due to heavy rains and a dam breach, Super Typhoon Ragasa has struck Hong Kong and southern China with devastating force. The storm brought hurricane-strength winds and a massive storm surge, causing significant flooding and damage in Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people. In response to the approaching typhoon, authorities in southern China evacuated hundreds of thousands of residents from low-lying areas to ensure their safety.</p>

          <p>According to a study by Oxford Economics, the activities of YouTube content creators contributed £2.2 billion to the UK's economy and supported 45,000 jobs in 2024. This economic impact has prompted the launch of an all-party parliamentary group to better represent the interests of creators and influencers, who have often felt undervalued by policymakers. The new group aims to address challenges faced by creators, such as access to funding and navigating regulations, to help the sector grow further.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines Secretary of State Marco Rubio's recent praise for Mexico's cooperation in fighting crime, questioning whether it reflects a genuine strategic shift or a tactical move by Mexico's new government. The author argues that while Mexico has taken some positive steps like extraditing cartel leaders, the underlying collusion between the state and criminal organizations remains unaddressed. The piece suggests that without tackling this systemic issue, any current improvements in cooperation are likely to be temporary and fragile.</p>

For millennia, exotic spices like cinnamon and pepper were highly valued commodities, driving exploration, conquest, and the establishment of global trade empires, while also being associated with wealth, holiness, and medicine.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," emphasizing that the two nations should be partners, not rivals. During the meeting with the first such delegation in six years, Wang urged Washington to respect the stabilizing trend in bilateral relations and its commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit is seen as a cautious step toward reopening channels of communication between the two global powers amid ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>After President Donald Trump publicly complained about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter during his visit to the United Nations, the global body has clarified the cause. A UN spokesperson stated that a videographer from the U.S. delegation inadvertently triggered the escalator's safety stop mechanism. Additionally, a UN official noted that the White House was responsible for operating the president's teleprompter, suggesting the technical difficulties originated within Trump's own team rather than with the UN's facilities.</p>

          <p>United Airlines briefly grounded all its departing flights across the United States and Canada due to a "brief connectivity issue." The ground stop, which lasted for about half an hour, marked the second time in less than two months that the airline has had to halt its operations because of a technological problem. In early August, a similar issue caused widespread, hours-long delays across the carrier's network, raising questions about the stability of its systems.</p>
