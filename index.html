          <p>During the Karen Read murder trial, a medical examiner testified about the skull fractures and hypothermia found in John O'Keefe's autopsy.

The medical examiner acknowledged that O'Keefe's injuries could be consistent with a fall on frozen ground, but also noted the absence of grass on the back of his head.

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly to avoid becoming a "shock absorber" in the global trade imbalances resulting from the US-China trade war. Despite a recent easing of tensions between the superpowers, economists suggest that Europe needs deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies to become a "third pole" in a bipolar world. Otherwise, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes, potentially hindering its economic growth and influence.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost an appeal against a defamation judgement that found he committed war crimes. The 2023 ruling stated that news articles alleging he murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, and the appeal was unanimously upheld by three Federal Court judges. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and plans to appeal to the High Court of Australia. The civil trial, dubbed "the trial of the century," assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces for the first time.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly seeking out specific federal jurisdictions to file cases with nationwide impact, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives frequently target small federal courts in Texas, often with single judges appointed by Republicans, while liberals have favored courts in the 9th Circuit and, more recently, Massachusetts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions, raising concerns about impartiality and the judicial process.</p>

NYU accused the student of lying about his planned speech and expressed its strong denouncement of his remarks. The university is pursuing disciplinary action against him.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees at Voice of America, a federally funded news network, signaling a continued effort to dismantle the broadcaster. The layoffs targeted contractors, including journalists, and came as the federal building housing the network was put up for sale. The move follows a court ruling ordering the government to maintain news programming at the network, which President Trump has criticized. Some journalists who were terminated are from countries with repressive governments, and now face having to leave the United States.</p>

It is clear from the arguments that the justices are ideologically divided and the outcome likely will turn on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Brett M.
