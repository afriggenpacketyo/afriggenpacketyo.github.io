          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway surged by 213% in May, contrasting with a downward trend in other European countries, primarily driven by the revamped Model Y. While Tesla's European sales have been impacted by reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric and political activities, Norway's strong EV incentives and infrastructure have supported Tesla's growth. The Norwegian EV Association suggests that Musk's political views may deter some buyers, but the Model Y's value and suitability for Norwegian needs contribute to its popularity. Norway is recognized as a leader in sustainable transportation, aiming to eliminate gasoline and diesel cars from its new car market.</p>

The stable was closed indefinitely in April 2024 after Hakuho took responsibility for one of his proteges physically abusing younger wrestlers.

          <p>The family of Aziz Ziriat, a London hiker who went missing in the Italian Dolomites, is "heartbroken" after his body was found. Ziriat, 36, disappeared while hiking with a friend on New Year's Day, and his remains were discovered in a rocky crevice. His family expressed gratitude to the rescue teams and remembered him as someone who "lived every moment with optimism, good humour and humility." The Palace for Life Foundation, where Ziriat worked, described him as an "incredible person with an infectious love for life."</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to save money and earn returns that outpace inflation, with FDIC or NCUA insurance protecting balances up to $250,000. While national average CD yields range from 1.70% to 2.01%, top-performing CDs offer significantly higher rates. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include considering online banks, which often have lower overhead costs, and opting for short-term CDs, which currently offer competitive interest rates. Laddering CDs, by buying some with one-year, two-year, and three-year terms, can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage and refinance rates remain elevated, with the average 30-year mortgage rate at 6.95% and the 15-year mortgage rate at 6.14% as of June 2, 2025. While rates are higher than in previous years, potential homebuyers and homeowners can still secure favorable rates by strengthening their credit profiles and shopping around for different lenders. Borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. It's important to consider loan terms, fees, and overall costs before making a decision and to lock in a rate after approval.

Saving for retirement requires discipline, and it's important to avoid spending money before it even arrives. He suggests using a conservative approach to saving.</p>
