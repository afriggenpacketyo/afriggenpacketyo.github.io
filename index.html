          <p>European stock markets saw a decline as traders awaited the crucial quarterly earnings report from Nvidia, a bellwether for the global technology sector and the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. Further dampening market sentiment were concerns over potential political instability in France, where opposition parties have indicated they will not support Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in a forthcoming confidence vote regarding the 2026 budget. This political uncertainty contributed to the pan-European Stoxx 600 falling for a second consecutive session. Meanwhile, mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets followed China's industrial profits data, alongside the implementation of new U.S. tariffs on India, painting a picture of diverse global economic pressures influencing investor behavior.

          <p>Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen summoned the senior U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen after reports surfaced detailing alleged covert influence operations by American citizens in Greenland. The purported goal of these operations was to infiltrate Greenland's society and advocate for its secession from Denmark to the United States, a proposition previously expressed by President Donald Trump. Danish intelligence had already issued warnings about foreign actors targeting Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark. This diplomatic incident highlights a significant point of tension between Denmark and the U.S., with Denmark emphasizing that any interference in its internal affairs is unacceptable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an essential explanation of tariffs, defining them as taxes levied on imported goods, typically a percentage of their value, which importers may then pass on to consumers. President Donald Trump utilizes tariffs as a core component of his trade policy, aiming to incentivize American-made goods, increase tax revenue, and reduce the U.S. trade deficit, often employing them as a strategic negotiation tool. His administration has implemented a broad program of tariffs with diverse rates targeting specific products and nations, although some measures have faced legal challenges regarding his executive authority. Critics contend that these protectionist policies introduce significant volatility into the global economy, resulting in higher prices for American consumers and prompting international organizations to lower their global economic growth forecasts.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, this article explores the lasting psychological and social impact on its youngest survivors, many of whom are now adults. The storm, which caused 1,200 deaths and displaced hundreds of thousands, disproportionately affected poor and predominantly Black neighborhoods, leading to widespread trauma, mental health issues, and fractured community bonds. Many children struggled to cope, with limited access to support, and often remained silent about their experiences for years. The article also touches on New Orleans' continued vulnerability to climate change and criticizes the "resilience" narrative for potentially shifting responsibility from those in power to act on preparedness and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households face a 2% increase in gas and electricity prices starting October, as announced by energy regulator Ofgem. This adjustment will raise the typical annual energy bill by £35, reaching £1,755, which is slightly more than analysts had anticipated. The rise is attributed to higher energy transport costs and new government support measures for consumers, funded by increased standing charges. Campaigners warn this will lead to another winter of high energy bills, exacerbating existing struggles with energy debt.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, with declines narrowing to 1.5% year-on-year, a significant improvement from steeper drops in previous months. This positive shift is attributed to Beijing's intensified campaign against "involution," or excessive competition and price wars, which had been hurting corporate profitability. While profits in the mining sector continued to fall, manufacturing and utilities saw improvements, with state-backed firms experiencing a drop, but foreign-invested and private enterprises showing profit increases. This article highlights the early effectiveness of government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and fostering healthier business conditions, even as challenges like factory-gate deflation persist.

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley secured his first main-draw victory at the US Open, overcoming nerves and a heckler to defeat Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in a four-set battle. The 24-year-old Scot struggled with his serve, committing 16 double faults in the opening sets, but found his rhythm in the fourth to close out the match. Fearnley's rapid ascent in rankings, from outside the top 500 a year ago to cracking the top 50, highlights his inexperience at the highest level.

The letter, backed by over 180 current and former FEMA staff, sharply criticized recent cuts to the agency's personnel and programs, warning that these measures dangerously diminished its capacity to effectively respond to major disasters. Key concerns raised included a new expenditure approval policy requiring Homeland Security Secretary approval for contracts over $100,000, the reassignment of FEMA employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as mandated by law.

          <p>Despite outward appearances of disinterest in peace, Russia's struggling economy could become a crucial factor influencing President Vladimir Putin's approach to negotiations with Ukraine. The article highlights Russia's widening budget deficit, which reached 2.2% of GDP by July, and a significant surge in government spending, largely on defense. Declining oil export revenues, coupled with sanctions and lower global demand, may force the Kremlin to consider spending cuts or further tax increases, risking a prolonged recession. Inflationary pressures and labor shortages also weigh on the economy, suggesting that continued warfare at the current intensity could be unsustainable. (not investment advice)</p>
