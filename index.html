          <p>The suspect in a firebombing attack on a pro-Israel march in Boulder, Colorado, will now face first-degree murder charges after an 82-year-old victim, Karen Diamond, died from her injuries.

The amended complaint also includes 66 new counts related to 14 additional victims identified during the investigation, bringing the total number of victims to 29.

          <p>A key provision in President Trump's major budget bill aims to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, a move the White House frames as a benefit for working-class Americans. The proposal would create a new deduction for tipped workers, though legislative versions differ on income caps and deduction limits, and the tax cut would expire in 2028. Critics, including the Independent Restaurant Coalition and some economists, argue the policy is poorly targeted, as it would not help the lowest-earning workers who already have no federal income tax liability.

This conflict has intensified since Zambada's capture, leading to over 1,200 deaths and horrific acts of public violence.

          <p>Athletic apparel company Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the warehouse retailer of selling "knockoff" products that infringe on its designs. The lawsuit claims that certain Costco items, such as hoodies and pants, are "confusingly similar" to popular Lululemon products like the "Scuba" hoodie and "Define" jacket, constituting trade dress infringement. Lululemon alleges that these "dupes" are intended to mislead consumers and is seeking damages and an end to the sale of the infringing products.

          <p>The U.S. dollar has suffered its worst performance for the first half of a year since 1973, falling over 10% against a basket of other major currencies.
