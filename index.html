The company reported a 5% rise in sales to $3.65 billion and 5% comparable sales growth, outperforming estimates. CEO Lauren Hobart attributed this success to effective long-term strategies and strong operational execution. Despite slight tariff-related price increases, consumer spending remains robust, and the Foot Locker acquisition is set to close, making Dick's the top athletic footwear seller in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, challenging his attempt to remove her from office. Trump cited constitutional powers and allegations of false statements on her mortgage, though no charges have been brought. Cook's attorney argues the removal is unlawful, requiring "cause" under the Federal Reserve Act, which an unsubstantiated allegation does not meet. The case raises significant legal questions about the Fed's autonomy and could reach the Supreme Court, as Trump seeks to replace officials unfavorable to his interest rate agenda.</p>

          <p>Credit card debt in the U.S. reached $1.21 trillion in Q2, with a new survey indicating that debt struggles are now affecting consumers across all income levels, not just lower-income households. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) reports a rise in "negative debt behaviors," such as making less than minimum payments and consolidating debt. Experts attribute this trend to worsening employment, sustained inflation, and high interest rates. Lenders are also tightening credit card standards, while demand for mortgages and auto loans has decreased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) faces a deepening crisis following the dismissal of its director, Susan Monarez. Her attorneys assert she remains in her post, arguing that only the President can remove a Senate-confirmed official, and accuse Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health." Monarez reportedly clashed with Kennedy over vaccine policy. In the wake of her removal, four senior CDC leaders, including the Chief Medical Officer, have resigned, citing frustration with Kennedy's approach to vaccines and management style.</p>

Tehran also aims to improve relations with Gulf rivals to prevent a pro-American, anti-Iranian regional axis.

          <p>Christopher Barbour, an Alabama death row inmate for 31 years, has been granted a new trial by a federal judge due to new DNA evidence. Recent forensic tests revealed another man's DNA on the victim's body, challenging Barbour's 1992 murder conviction which relied heavily on a confession he claims was coerced. The judge ruled that prosecutors failed to disclose initial forensics notes excluding Barbour as the DNA source, violating his constitutional rights. The state plans to appeal, but Barbour now has the opportunity to argue his innocence to a jury.</p>

          <p>Australia expelled Iran's ambassador and three officials, designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, following credible intelligence linking Iran to attacks on Australian Jews. These included arson on a Sydney kosher restaurant and a Melbourne synagogue. The article highlights the IRGC's history of decentralized attacks on Jewish civilians globally, often using criminal networks. This decisive action by Canberra, despite Iran's denials, underscores Tehran's malign reach and its internal ideological divisions that prioritize destabilization over diplomatic pragmatism.</p>

          <p>This article argues against the Trump administration's reported plan to use unilateral military force against drug cartels in Latin America, suggesting it would be diplomatically costly with little strategic gain. Instead, it advocates for continuing current diplomatic efforts with Mexico, citing recent cooperation on extraditions and border surveillance. The author emphasizes that supply-side strategies alone are historically ineffective, especially for synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The piece proposes focusing on demand reduction and harm reduction policies, noting a 25% drop in overdose deaths and encouraging generational trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has targeted cashless bail policies, asserting they endanger Americans and lead to repeat offenses, demanding a list of jurisdictions that have eliminated cash bail. However, this article argues Trump's claims are based on "received fantasy" and lack evidence. Department of Justice data indicates most defendants, whether on bail or released, appear for court and do not engage in crime sprees. The piece highlights that cash bail is biased against minorities and the economically disadvantaged, offering no crime suppression benefits, but rather serving as a profitable industry for large insurance companies.

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is shrinking, with nearly half of FDIC-insured banks disappearing since 2005 due to mergers and acquisitions by large institutions. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was named the soundest in the world during the 2008 financial crisis. Experts suggest Canada's stability stems from its large players relying on collective economic strength. However, critics warn that market domination can stifle competition, innovation, and lead to less favorable pricing. The Federal Reserve's proposal to lower capital requirements for big U.S. banks could further accelerate consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday lets, aiming for an average of 182 days let over several years instead of a strict annual threshold. Since 2023, properties needed to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. Critics, including Welsh language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith and the Professional Association of Self-Caterers (PASC), argue the changes are insufficient and the 182-day threshold continues to harm the tourism industry.
