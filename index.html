          <h2>Trump Pardons Walczak, Linked to Ashley Biden's Diary</h2>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Paul Walczak, a Florida health care executive, whose mother was involved in trying to publicize Ashley Biden's diary. Walczak was sentenced to 18 months in prison for tax crimes. His mother, Elizabeth Fago, a Republican donor, played a role in efforts to undermine Joseph R. Biden Jr. during the 2020 election. This pardon raises questions about the use of presidential power and its potential connection to political allies.</p>

          <h2>Judge Questions Deportation of U.S. Citizen Child</h2>

          <p>A federal judge expressed concern that the Trump administration deported a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras 'with no meaningful process' and against her father's wishes. The judge questioned why the child was sent with her mother despite the father's emergency petition to prevent it. Asserting that it is illegal to deport a U.S. citizen, the judge scheduled a hearing to investigate the matter. This case raises serious questions about due process and the rights of U.S. citizens.</p>
