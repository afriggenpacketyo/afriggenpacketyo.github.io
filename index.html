          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon. The ruling came after the administration attempted to mobilize units from California and Texas, a move the judge deemed a contravention of her previous order blocking the use of Oregon's own National Guard. The legal challenge was brought by Oregon and California, whose officials argued the deployment was an unnecessary and inflammatory federal overreach in response to small, ongoing protests. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to use federalized military forces in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of engaging in a "hybrid war" against Germany and Europe, extending beyond the military conflict in Ukraine. Merz stated that Russia is conducting an information war and is likely behind recent drone incidents near European airports, which he characterized as attempts to intimidate and create uncertainty. He emphasized that Germany will not be intimidated and will defend itself, asserting that supporting Ukraine is essential for protecting Europe's liberal societies. The comments highlight growing concerns in Berlin over Moscow's covert activities and their impact on European security and infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, analysts suggest that an upcoming military pay date on October 15 could be a critical turning point. The potential political fallout from 1.3 million active-duty service members missing a paycheck may compel Congress and the White House to reach a compromise. Economists from Goldman Sachs noted this date as a significant "forcing event" that could lead to at least a temporary funding resolution. While both political parties remain entrenched, the widespread impact of a missed military pay period is seen as a powerful catalyst for negotiation, unlike other shutdown-related disruptions.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old mother in Brazoria County, Texas, faces two counts of murder and two counts of aggravated assault after authorities say she shot her four children inside a vehicle. The incident resulted in the deaths of her 13-year-old and 4-year-old children, while her other two children, ages 8 and 9, are hospitalized in stable condition. Officials reported that the mother called 911 herself following the shooting and a weapon was recovered at the scene. She is currently being held on a $14 million bond as the community grapples with the senseless tragedy.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Firefly announced its acquisition of defense technology contractor SciTec in a deal valued at $855 million, consisting of cash and stock. The move is intended to bolster Firefly's national security capabilities by integrating SciTec's expertise in missile warning, tracking, and autonomous command and control systems. This acquisition follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test but also comes amid a series of major government contracts for Firefly, including with NASA. The deal signals Firefly's strategic focus on strengthening its position within the defense and space sectors, with SciTec set to operate as a subsidiary.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in their home. This loan, most commonly the FHA-backed Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), allows individuals aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly repayments. The actual amount that can be borrowed depends on factors like the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. Homeowners who don't meet the equity threshold can explore options such as paying down their existing mortgage, waiting for their home value to appreciate, or downsizing to a less expensive property.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, upholding her 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. The court did not provide an explanation for its decision, effectively ending her primary legal path to overturn the 2021 conviction for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein's abuse. Maxwell's legal team expressed disappointment but vowed to continue exploring other legal options. This decision solidifies the verdict against the former British socialite, who was found guilty of facilitating the abuse that occurred between 1994 and 2004 with the late financier.</p>

Abd–Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, was convicted on 27 counts, including murder, rape, and torture, carried out as part of a government-backed plan to suppress a rebellion.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a financial aid package that could exceed $10 billion to support U.S. farmers impacted by trade disputes. The relief is primarily aimed at soybean farmers, who have been severely affected by a Chinese boycott of American soybeans, a major export market. Top economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed that discussions are underway and that "big measures" would be announced soon to address the issue of unsold crops. The potential aid follows President Trump's suggestion that revenue collected from new tariffs could be used to support the agricultural sector through the economic disruption.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has suspended the release of critical economic data, including the monthly jobs report and upcoming inflation figures. This data blackout creates significant uncertainty at a time when economists are concerned about a potential recession, following a recent hiring slowdown and rising inflation. The lack of official statistics leaves policymakers, businesses, and the Federal Reserve without crucial information needed to make informed decisions. Experts warn that operating in this "data vacuum" heightens economic risk and could mask the true impact of the shutdown itself on the nation's financial health.</p>

The mission, based in Japan, aims to gather intelligence on illicit trade supporting North Korea's weapons programs.

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to the city. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul accused the president of using the military to punish political adversaries, arguing the deployment violates federal law limiting domestic military use. The legal action follows the administration's plan to send hundreds of troops, which Governor JB Pritzker has called an "invasion."

This late-year surge is expected to build on the current box office tally, which is already running slightly ahead of the previous year.

The offer amounts to approximately one-tenth of a penny per ton, a stark reflection of coal's declining market value despite the Trump administration's efforts to promote the fuel source. The extremely low bid highlights the economic challenges facing the coal industry, as demand from power plants continues to shrink in favor of natural gas and renewable energy.

This swift collapse is the latest in a series of failed attempts by Macron to form a stable government.
