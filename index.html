          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is advocating for a constitutional amendment to replace the current single five-year presidential term with a system of two consecutive four-year terms. The proposal aims to synchronize presidential and parliamentary elections, fostering policy continuity and stability. However, the reform faces significant political hurdles, as it requires a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, where the opposition is expected to resist the changes, particularly those concerning LGBTQ+ rights and relations with North Korea.</p>

          <p>High-end fashion houses are increasingly collaborating with the creators of Labubu dolls, a popular line of collectible toys, to attract younger, digitally-savvy consumers. Brands like Moynat are launching exclusive collections featuring the characters, following a trend where cute, pop-culture figures are used to generate hype and emotional connection with customers. This strategy leverages the viral appeal of such characters on social media platforms to make traditional luxury goods more culturally relevant, though some analysts caution that such trends can be short-lived.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has initiated an urgent review following a BBC investigation that revealed asylum seekers are being transported long distances in taxis for appointments at a high cost to taxpayers. One reported journey cost £600 for a 250-mile trip to a doctor's appointment, raising questions about the efficiency and necessity of the system. The investigation highlights broader issues within the asylum system, including the use of hotels for housing and the lack of alternative transportation options presented to migrants.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine, with European support, is capable of winning back all of its territory from Russia. This marks a dramatic reversal from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the change, calling Trump "well informed" and a "game changer" after their productive meeting at the UN General Assembly. The new stance has been met with cautious optimism in Ukraine, though some remain skeptical about whether the rhetoric will translate into concrete action.</p>

The decision comes after the governor signed new camp safety laws, prompted by the tragedy, which mandate stricter regulations on cabin placement and emergency preparedness protocols.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the European Union's increasingly confrontational approach towards China is counterproductive to its own economic and environmental goals.

Furthermore, this adversarial stance could hinder the EU's green transition by obstructing the adoption of affordable Chinese clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Following the Supreme Court's ban on race-based affirmative action, the Trump administration is now arguing that even race-neutral admissions policies, such as those based on socioeconomic status, are illegal if their intent is to promote racial diversity. This interpretation has already led the College Board to shut down its Landscape tool, which provided universities with socioeconomic data about applicants. While courts have so far blocked the administration's stance, its continued pressure raises concerns that the era of using class-based preferences to maintain diversity could end prematurely.</p>

          <p>After a significant weekly jump in refinance applications, overall mortgage demand in the U.S. saw minimal growth last week, rising by only 0.6%.

          <p>In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump launched a sharp critique of the international body, describing it as a feckless and corrupt organization. He urged national leaders to reject what he termed a "globalist migration agenda" and to prioritize closing their borders. Trump's address positioned his "America First" ideology against the UN's cooperative framework, reflecting his administration's broader skepticism of multilateral institutions and agreements.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump, labeling him "racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic" after Trump's speech at the United Nations. During his address, Trump called Khan a "terrible mayor" and claimed London wants to "go to Sharia law." Khan dismissed the comments, questioning why the president seems preoccupied with him, while UK cabinet members and other political figures also rejected Trump's assertion, clarifying that Sharia law forms no part of the legal system in England and Wales.</p>

          <p>While the Philippines has seen fewer journalist killings and a slight improvement in press freedom rankings since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office, reporters and rights groups remain concerned. They warn of continued intimidation, politically motivated prosecutions, and a persistent culture of impunity for attacks against the media. High-profile cases, like the lengthy detention of journalist Frenchie Mae Cumpio on "trumped-up charges," suggest that despite a change in presidential rhetoric from the previous administration, significant threats to journalists still exist.</p>

          <p>A judge in the trial of Soldier F, a former paratrooper accused of murder and attempted murder on Bloody Sunday, has ruled that witness statements given by other soldiers in 1972 can be used as evidence.

The defense had challenged the reliability of the historical statements, but the ruling allows them to be submitted, marking a significant step in the long-running legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece argues that Jimmy Kimmel's return to television was a sober and forceful defense of the First Amendment, rather than a typical comedic monologue. By directly addressing the government pressure that led to his suspension, Kimmel highlighted the chilling effect of the Trump administration's actions on free speech. The article notes that the broad support for Kimmel from across the political spectrum and Hollywood demonstrated a unified pushback against what was perceived as a dangerous overreach by the FCC and the White House.</p>

Many voters, particularly pensioners, are dissatisfied with the current government's austerity measures and high inflation, despite recent positive economic indicators.

          <p>The city of Portland, Oregon, has formally accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of violating its operating permits by illegally detaining people overnight at its local field office. An investigation found multiple instances where ICE held individuals for longer than the permitted 12-hour limit, prompting the city to issue a notice of violation to the building's owner. This action creates a standoff between the sanctuary city and the Trump administration, which has recently threatened to deploy federal troops to Portland amid ongoing protests.</p>
