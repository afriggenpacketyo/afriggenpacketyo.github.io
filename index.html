          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential shift in British politics towards a more polarized, multiparty system. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes in Runcorn and Helsby, a traditionally Labour-held seat, highlighting voter frustration with both the Labour and Conservative parties. The victory was attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment fueled by economic dissatisfaction and immigration concerns, particularly regarding a local hotel housing migrants. The article also notes Reform's strong performance in municipal elections, potentially winning hundreds of seats, which could further disrupt the established political landscape. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, alleging left-wing bias in their news coverage.

          <p>Toyota, Honda, and other Japanese carmakers experienced a combined 11.8% increase in U.S. sales in April due to a rush of buying before the implementation of additional tariffs on imported cars.

However, the article notes that the auto market outlook remains uncertain as this last-minute buying may reduce future demand.</p>

The crowd, largely receptive, cheered at the scattershot injection of political issues, reflecting the current era where even graduation speeches are not immune to political polarization.
