        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has adjusted his promise to stop migrant arrivals on small boats within two weeks of gaining power. He clarified on a BBC program that the two-week timeline would begin only after new, stringent deportation laws are passed, a process that could take months. This new legislation would aim to create a legal duty for the home secretary to remove illegal migrants and would disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention to facilitate mass deportations. Farage's original, more direct pledge was a key announcement at his party's recent conference, where he cited Australia's policies as a model for success.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team is now likely to face host nation England in the World Cup quarter-finals following a defeat to Canada. Despite a strong performance and securing a last-eight spot with previous wins, the Scots were overcome by the world's number two ranked team. Canada established a lead through tries from McKinley Hunt, Emily Tuttosi, and a penalty try, holding off a Scottish comeback that included scores from Rhona Lloyd and Evie Gallagher. The loss positions Canada to top Pool B, setting up a compelling knockout stage for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially launched the effort to build his presidential library and museum in his home state of Delaware. A 13-person governance board, including former aides and allies, has been established by the Joe and Jill Biden Foundation to spearhead the fundraising and site selection process. The project faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate, with costs for presidential libraries often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The vision for the library includes an immersive museum detailing his presidency and a center for leadership, service, and civic engagement.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) specified that it plans to strike terrorist infrastructure and directed civilians to move south to a designated humanitarian zone in Al-Mawasi, Khan Yunis. This expansion of ground operations, named Operation Gideon’s Chariots II, has drawn criticism from international leaders, including those from the U.K. and Canada, who fear it will lead to more bloodshed and hinder peace efforts.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Arwa Mahdawi critiques Melania Trump's recent focus on artificial intelligence, arguing that her vision for managing AI's growth is at odds with the Trump administration's broader policies. The article highlights the former first lady's AI-themed events and contests for children, contrasting them with the administration's cuts to public education funding and efforts to censor educational content. The author also questions the effectiveness of the Take It Down Act, legislation championed by Mrs. Trump to combat image-based sexual abuse, suggesting it contains provisions that could be weaponized to suppress free speech.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers tuned in for a rare live-streamed dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The expedition, conducted by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) named Emmy, explored depths of over 1,500 feet, showcasing the unique ecosystem of the ancient lakebed. Hosted by environmental non-profits, the event aimed to raise awareness about the lake's ecological importance and the challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts discussed the lake's geological history and unique species, while also dispelling popular myths about mob bodies, though they did note the discovery of trash in past dives.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her first television interview since joining the court, asserted that its rulings are not a reflection of the justices' personal opinions but an interpretation of what the American people have decided through the democratic process. Promoting her new book, Barrett addressed criticism of the court's recent decisions, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which she argued "respected the choice" of Americans. The interview comes as the court faces a request to reconsider the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, a right currently supported by a majority of the public.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has unveiled a comprehensive plan to boost PepsiCo's performance, after taking a $4 billion stake in the consumer goods giant. The proposal urges the company to refranchise its bottling network, streamline its product portfolio by divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and reinvest capital into core brands such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues that strategic missteps in Pepsi's North American beverage and food divisions have led to significant stock underperformance and a valuation discount compared to competitors like Coca-Cola. The firm believes its plan could unlock over 50% upside for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

Joy argues that renting provides greater flexibility and frees up capital and mental energy that would otherwise be spent on hidden homeownership costs like maintenance, renovations, and property management.

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television presenter Matt Tebbutt will be the new judge on *MasterChef: The Professionals*, joining Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti. Tebbutt, host of *Saturday Kitchen*, replaces Gregg Wallace, who was dismissed from the *MasterChef* franchise in July.

Tebbutt expressed that it was an "absolute honour" to join the program, while his new co-judges praised his extensive experience in the restaurant industry.</p>

          <p>China is designing a planetary defense mission to test its ability to deflect a near-Earth asteroid, according to the chief designer of the country's lunar exploration program. The mission, which officials hope to launch this year, would involve sending an impactor spacecraft to collide with a small asteroid millions of kilometers away. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a few centimeters, demonstrating the "kinetic impact" technique for planetary defense. If successful, China would join the United States as the only other nation to have demonstrated this capability, following NASA's DART mission.</p>

          <p>The family of Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, a 26-year-old American-Turkish activist killed by an Israeli sniper in the occupied West Bank, is marking the one-year anniversary of her death by renewing calls for an independent U.S. investigation. Eygi was shot while volunteering with Palestinian communities in September 2024. An Israeli military probe concluded the shooting was unintentional, a finding disputed by a Washington Post investigation and the Turkish government. Despite repeated requests from the family, the U.S. has not launched its own investigation, a response the family describes as deeply disillusioning and indicative of a double standard.</p>

          <p>A recent National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. featured a speaker lineup that showcased the increasingly muddled distinction between the Trump administration and the far-right. The event included theocratic Christian nationalists and far-right publishers alongside senior Republican figures like Senator Eric Schmitt and Deputy Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon. Critics, such as the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, argue that the participation of administration officials in an event with extremists demonstrates the normalization of white nationalist and anti-democratic viewpoints within the Republican party. The conference's agenda appeared to align closely with the administration's Project 2025 blueprint.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching new records this year, gaining about 35% to near $3,600 an ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Experts suggest that economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut are driving the rally. For those seeking exposure, financial advisors typically recommend using low-cost, liquid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). They generally advise against owning physical bullion due to higher costs and suggest limiting gold to a small portion, under 3%, of a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

Acutis, who grew up with the internet, has been dubbed a "computer genius" by the Vatican for using his skills to create a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles. His story presents a blend of modern relatability—he played video games and wore Nikes—and traditional piety, appealing both to those seeking a contemporary role model and those drawn to the faith's supernatural elements. His rapid path to sainthood reflects the Church's effort to engage with younger generations in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the musical *Hamilton* is being re-examined as it arrives in movie theaters for the first time, prompting questions about how its once-celebrated progressive message holds up. The article suggests the show's optimistic, Obama-era vision of America feels different in the current political climate, with its "Act One" hopefulness giving way to the "Act Two" fear of political fracture. While initially embraced across the political spectrum, the show later became a symbol of counter-Trump sentiment. The commentary also notes that critiques of the musical's historical inaccuracies and its glossing over of the founders' flaws have become more mainstream over time.</p>

Prosecutors detailed how the pair lured Vargas from a bar, beat her in an alley, and then pursued her in a truck. Surveillance footage showed Jimenez chasing Vargas on foot and fatally shooting her in the chest. Key evidence presented at the trial included a blood trail, a spent shell casing, and broken acrylic nails that were matched to Jimenez, helping investigators crack the case.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Venezuela, stating that its military aircraft will be "shot down" if they endanger U.S. naval ships operating in the region. The comment follows reports that Venezuelan jets flew near a U.S. vessel for the second time in two days, escalating tensions after a recent U.S. strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat from Venezuela. The Trump administration has been intensifying its anti-drug-trafficking operations in the Caribbean, deploying additional naval assets and fighter jets to the area.

The moves are driven by concerns over staff cuts at the CDC, changes to its influential vaccine advisory committee (ACIP), and a recent FDA decision to restrict eligibility for the fall COVID booster.
