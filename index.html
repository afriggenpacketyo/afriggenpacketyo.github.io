          <p>Lawmakers on the House Homeland Security Committee recently held a private roundtable to address the significant increase in antisemitic violence across the United States. The discussion focused on concerns over extremist rhetoric becoming mainstream, particularly on college campuses and social media, and the potential political rise of figures with anti-Israel views. Participants, including law enforcement and community safety groups, explored ways to improve intelligence sharing and interagency coordination to combat threats, which have reached record highs. The meeting is expected to inform future legislation aimed at enhancing security and ensuring robust prosecution of antisemitic crimes.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card business from Goldman Sachs, which would further solidify its position as the largest credit card issuer in the U.S. The move would allow Goldman Sachs to exit its troubled foray into consumer credit cards, a venture that faced challenges with high growth rates and loan loss provisions. For Apple, this potential partnership shifts its high-profile credit card to a more established consumer banking giant. Other contenders like American Express and Barclays have reportedly dropped out of the bidding process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock price fell significantly after the company reported a net loss and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations for the recent quarter. CEO Daniel Ek expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the advertising business, calling it an "execution challenge" despite remaining confident in the long-term strategy. The music streaming service also provided weak guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing foreign exchange headwinds. While monthly active users and premium subscribers continued to grow, the sluggish ad revenue and rising costs contributed to the financial shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, fueled by its highest airplane delivery numbers since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," citing improved stability in production and performance, though the company still faces challenges, including a delay in the certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. The aerospace giant has stabilized production of its 737 Max at the FAA's limit of 38 per month following intense scrutiny after a mid-air door plug incident. (not investment advice)</p>

The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate to combat inflation, and despite the President's criticism, Powell has indicated no immediate cuts are necessary given the solid economy. With the labor market holding up and potential inflationary effects from new tariffs, policymakers are expected to remain cautious. Most analysts predict a potential rate cut is more likely at the September meeting, not this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a surge in U.S. imports as companies rushed to stock up before potential tariff hikes.

However, the organization warned that this "front-loading" of trade creates risks, such as excess inventory, and that sustained high tariffs and uncertainty could still weaken future economic activity.

Instead, savers should assess their financial needs, considering whether they require liquidity, which might favor a high-yield savings account.

          <p>Thousands of Afghans who fled the Taliban regime and were approved for humanitarian admission to Germany are now stranded in Pakistan, living in fear of deportation. Delays in the German visa process, combined with Pakistan's crackdown on undocumented migrants, have left them in a precarious limbo. Many, including journalists and activists at risk under the Taliban, report harassment by Pakistani authorities and some have already been deported. The situation is compounded by Germany's recent shift toward a tougher stance on migration, leaving the fate of these vulnerable individuals highly uncertain as they wait for resettlement.</p>

          <p>A new study of the 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence that its society was centered around women. By analyzing DNA from skeletons buried under homes, researchers discovered that households were often formed on a matrilineal basis, with men moving in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence, combined with the finding that female graves contained significantly more burial goods than male ones, confirms long-held archaeological theories about the elevated status of women in this ancient community. The findings offer a fascinating glimpse into a prehistoric society with a social structure different from later patriarchal models.</p>

          <p>India is home to approximately 75% of the world's wild tiger population, with numbers on the rise, but conservationists warn of ongoing risks to their long-term survival. The primary threats are habitat fragmentation due to deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. Human-wildlife conflict is also a major concern, particularly in areas where settlements and forests overlap. While India has implemented modern monitoring techniques and established numerous tiger reserves, experts stress that protecting the quality and connectivity of these habitats is crucial for a sustainable future for the species.</p>

The report projects that by 2030, Africa will account for nearly 60% of the world's hungry population. The crisis is driven by a combination of conflict, climate change, high food price inflation, and national debt burdens that limit public spending.

P&G's CFO stated that while the company can offset some of these costs through productivity, price increases on about a quarter of its products, like Tide and Charmin, will be necessary.

Finally, successful companies re-evaluate their work to eliminate low-impact tasks and projects that are not aligned with their main goals.

          <p>This opinion article argues against the recent attempts by some conservative media figures to reframe Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted associate, as a victim of a miscarriage of justice. The author suggests this narrative rehabilitation is a political strategy potentially aimed at securing a deal with Maxwell in exchange for a presidential pardon that could benefit Donald Trump. The columnist emphasizes that Epstein's accusers have consistently described Maxwell as an active participant in their abuse, not a victim. The piece concludes that if Maxwell is pardoned, it will be for political expediency, not in the interest of justice.</p>
