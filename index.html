          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that Ukraine will not cede any territory to Russia, emphasizing that any peace negotiations conducted without Kyiv's involvement would be "dead decisions." His remarks come in response to a proposed summit in Alaska between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Trump suggested a deal could involve "swapping of territories." Zelenskyy warned that such an approach undermines Ukraine's constitutional integrity and that a lasting peace requires his nation's direct participation. The article also notes ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a meeting between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and European officials to discuss the path to peace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry has transformed dramatically over the decades, mirroring the region's shifting political landscape. Initially portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in post-independence films, the cinematic lens shifted following the rise of anti-India militancy in the late 1980s. Kashmir became a symbol of conflict, with narratives often focusing on Indian patriotism and framing militants as antagonists. More recent films, especially after India revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomy in 2019, have been criticized for aligning with government narratives and potentially deepening sectarian divides, reflecting a move from nuanced human stories to more "statist" perspectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a potential sign of easing tensions, South Korea's military has detected North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border. This action follows South Korea's own dismantling of its speakers earlier in the week, a move initiated by new liberal President Lee Jae Myung to improve relations. For months, the two nations had engaged in a tit-for-tat psychological warfare campaign, with the South broadcasting K-pop and anti-Pyongyang messages and the North responding with irritating noises. While a positive step, tensions could rise again with upcoming U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which the North views as a provocation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied the existence of a conspiracy to ruin her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond, who was cleared of sexual offense charges in 2020 but died last year, of being willing to destroy the Scottish National Party rather than see it succeed without him. Sturgeon describes her refusal to intervene in the government's investigation into complaints against him as the breaking point in their political partnership. The memoir provides her perspective on the fallout, which she frames as a defense of Scotland's democratic institutions against Salmond's destructive behavior.</p>

          <p>Officials have lifted the last evacuation orders for the Canyon fire in Southern California, which has burned over 5,000 acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. With the fire now 28% contained, crews are focusing on securing the perimeter and managing hot spots. The firefighting efforts were complicated by a regional heat wave, with inland areas experiencing triple-digit temperatures that are expected to continue through the weekend. The fire also resulted in the serious injury of a Kern County Fire Department Battalion Chief, who was involved in a vehicle rollover while working on the incident.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were wounded when one stepped on a landmine along the tense border with Cambodia, an incident Thailand is calling a "clear violation" of international law by the Cambodian side. The blast comes just days after the two countries agreed to extend a ceasefire that ended their deadliest clashes in decades over disputed border territory. Cambodia has denied laying any new mines, stating it is committed to the Ottawa Convention banning them and that the ordnance could be from past conflicts. The incident threatens to undermine recent peace efforts and highlights the persistent dangers and mistrust in the region.</p>

          <p>At least 365 people were arrested in London's Parliament Square during a demonstration supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the U.K.'s Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of activists display signs with messages like "I support Palestine Action," leading to mass arrests for the criminal offense of supporting a banned organization. The government banned the group after its activists caused millions in damages to military aircraft. Protesters argued the ban infringes on free speech and the right to protest, while the Home Office stated the proscription was based on "strong security advice" due to the group's serious criminal acts.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend weapons exports to Israel has triggered significant opposition from within his own conservative political alliance, the CDU/CSU. Critics argue the move breaks with Germany's long-standing foreign policy of special responsibility toward Israel, a principle known as "Staatsräson." However, the decision has also found support from some conservatives and the coalition's junior partner, the Social Democrats, who cite the need to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The internal political division reflects Germany's complex balancing act between its historical commitment to Israel and growing concerns over the conflict's civilian toll.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of modern gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the 2010 Republican "REDMAP" project. Following Barack Obama's 2008 victory, strategists targeted key state legislative races to gain control of the redistricting process after the 2010 census. Using advanced mapping software, they drew districts that locked in Republican majorities in state legislatures and the U.S. House for a decade, even when Democrats won more overall votes. This strategy has entrenched hard-right lawmakers, insulated them from electoral consequences, and fundamentally altered the American political landscape by allowing legislative outcomes to be determined by map lines rather than voters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This move is seen by James's office and supporters as a politically motivated retaliation for her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization. In a statement, her lawyer called it a "blatant and desperate example" of the administration carrying out a political retribution campaign. The investigation into a state's top law enforcement official by the federal government marks a significant escalation in the political and legal battles surrounding the president.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official documents, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, have revealed that radioactive water leaked from the Coulport naval armaments depot into a Scottish loch. The leaks, which included low levels of tritium, were caused by repeatedly bursting pipes that the Royal Navy had failed to properly maintain. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) attributed the incidents to "shortfalls in maintenance" at the base, which stores the U.K.'s Trident nuclear warheads. While both Sepa and the Ministry of Defence stated there was no unsafe release or significant environmental risk, the revelation raises concerns about the safety and maintenance of critical nuclear infrastructure.</p>

          <p>In a significant shift in strategy, leading Democrats are now advocating for fighting "fire with fire" by pursuing their own aggressive gerrymandering. This change is a direct response to a new push by President Trump and Republicans to redraw maps in states like Texas and Florida to gain more House seats. Democratic governors in California, New York, and Illinois have expressed their intent to retaliate, with some former proponents of nonpartisan reform now arguing it is a necessary measure to combat an "authoritarian" threat to democracy. The development signals a potential new arms race in partisan map-drawing, sacrificing the moral high ground to prevent a permanent structural disadvantage.</p>

          <p>A development partnership has invested over $104 million to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The project, which began in 2020, preserved the historic building's architectural character while creating 205 modern units, including 62 designated for affordable housing. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which had long sought a way to repurpose the deteriorating but beautiful structure. The successful conversion has been embraced by the community for revitalizing a local landmark and providing new housing options.</p>

Officials from the Interior and Foreign Ministries have expressed hesitation, citing security concerns and a preference for providing aid locally. Conservative politicians also voiced fears that accepting the children could lead to a new wave of immigration through family reunification, a sensitive political issue in Germany. The debate reveals a conflict between humanitarian impulses at the local level and national-level political and security considerations, contrasting with other European nations that have already accepted children.</p>

A Republican appointed by presidents from both parties, he was widely respected as a non-political public servant who helped stabilize the nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies during turbulent times.

Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch devoted her nearly 70-year career to perfecting the art of flower painting. Her work is characterized by its scientific precision, dramatic lighting, and complex compositions that often brought together blooms from different seasons and continents. The renewed focus on her art explores its aesthetic, scientific, and moral dimensions, repositioning her as a pivotal figure in art history.</p>
