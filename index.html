          <p>President Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. The Reagan Foundation stated the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 radio address, using selective audio without permission. Trump accused Canada of attempting to interfere with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on tariffs, deeming tariffs essential for national security and the economy. The Ontario Premier had previously announced a $75 million ad campaign in the U.S. featuring Reagan's criticism of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ireland held its presidential election with over 3.6 million voters casting ballots to determine the next head of state. The main contenders are Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, representing the center-right governing party, Fine Gael. The election marks the first near two-way presidential contest since 1973, with results expected to be announced at Dublin Castle. The winner will serve a seven-year term, with the role carrying important constitutional duties despite being largely ceremonial. </p>

          <p>Two federal judges, Julien Xavier Neals and Henry Wingate, acknowledged that their staff used artificial intelligence to prepare court orders that contained errors. The admissions came after an inquiry by Senator Chuck Grassley, who described the court orders as "error-ridden." Both judges stated that the rulings did not undergo their chambers' usual review processes, and they have since implemented measures to improve ruling reviews. The use of AI in legal research and drafting is now explicitly prohibited in Judge Neals's chamber, and Judge Wingate replaced the erroneous order. </p>

The condition is now the second-most widespread mental health disorder for young adults, with many struggling to access NHS treatment. Charities attribute the rise to societal pressures and social media, while experts note the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government says it is expanding mental health support, but charities insist there is an OCD crisis and call for more funding. </p>

          <h2>Trump Ends Trade Talks with Canada Over TV Ads</h2>

          <p>President Trump announced the end of trade negotiations with Canada, citing a television ad opposing U.S. tariffs as misstating facts and influencing court decisions. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the ad misrepresented a 1987 Reagan address, leading Trump to call it "egregious behavior." Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney aims to double exports outside the U.S. due to the threat posed by Trump's tariffs. The decision could escalate trade tensions between the neighboring countries.

          <p>Gaza doctors are investigating potential signs of torture on unnamed bodies returned by Israel, amid limited resources and facilities. Photos show bodies with signs of injury, bound wrists, and possible strangulation marks. The forensic team at Nasser hospital faces challenges due to lack of cold storage and DNA testing, hindering thorough investigation. Outside experts suggest that some markings raise questions about abuse but require post-mortems for concrete conclusions. Concerns persist regarding widespread abuse of detainees in Israeli custody. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland reportedly told DOJ superiors that there is insufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff with mortgage fraud. This follows calls from President Trump to criminally charge Schiff, a critic who acted as prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment. MSNBC reported that U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, but Blanche denied the meeting occurred. Schiff's lawyer stated the allegations are politically motivated and baseless, calling the effort vindictive. </p>

This decision fulfills pledges made by President Trump and congressional Republicans, aiming to reopen the refuge's coastal plain to development.
