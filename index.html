          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to 17 others, 14 of whom were also children. The suspect, identified as Robin Westman, died by self-inflicted gunshot and is being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime against Catholics. Authorities found a manifesto and noted the suspect's mother previously worked at the school. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged against using the incident to fuel anti-transgender hatred.</p>

        </div>

          <p>The Welsh government has proposed modifying its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, introducing flexibility by allowing an average of 182 let days over several years, including charity contributions. Since 2023, properties must be available for 252 days and let for 182 days to qualify for lower non-domestic rates, a criterion 40% of lets haven't met. Critics, including industry groups, argue these changes are insufficient to address the tourism sector's crisis and the housing situation. A consultation is ongoing, with legislative changes potentially taking effect in April 2026.</p>

          <p>A new survey from the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce reveals that China's top 500 private enterprises achieved a combined overseas revenue of 3.19 trillion yuan (US$445.8 billion) last year, marking a nearly 15 percent increase from 2023. The report highlights the sector's steady progress, improved profitability, and enhanced core competitiveness despite external challenges. Private firms are crucial to China's economy, contributing over half of the nation's total tax revenue, 60 percent of its GDP, and 80 percent of urban employment. This growth underscores the increasing global reach and resilience of China's private sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CDC Director Susan Monarez's lawyers contend she remains in her role, arguing only President Trump can dismiss presidential appointees, despite a White House staff notification. Monarez reportedly resisted "unscientific, reckless directives" and refused to fire health experts, leading to her alleged targeting. This follows conflicts with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy and four other top health officials quitting. Kennedy publicly stated the CDC needs fixing to restore its "gold standard science" and global respect, implying a significant leadership overhaul is underway.</p>

          <p>This article details Robin Westman, the 23-year-old suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting, who died by self-inflicted gunshot. Westman, who legally changed her name from Robert to Robin in 2020, identifying as female, had familial ties to the church and previously attended the school. Authorities uncovered disturbing YouTube videos and journals containing violent ideations, weapon doodles, and references to other school shootings, suggesting a complex motive. Despite these findings, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged against using the tragedy to fuel anti-transgender sentiment, focusing instead on community healing.</p>

          <p>The article explores potential lessons for the U.S. banking system from Canada's more concentrated model, as the number of FDIC-insured banks in the U.S. has significantly decreased since 2005. While Canada's system, with only 79 banks, was lauded for its stability during the 2008 financial crisis, experts debate whether market domination leads to less competition and innovation. Concerns arise as the U.S. Federal Reserve proposes lowering capital requirements for large banks, potentially accelerating consolidation. The article offers a comparative analysis of two distinct approaches to financial stability and market structure. (not investment advice)</p>

Slowing economic growth and reliance on energy imports are highlighted as key vulnerabilities, prompting China's push for indigenous innovation and diversified energy sources.

High rates of pregnant women accessing prenatal care and medication have been pivotal.

          <p>Rwanda has accepted seven individuals deported from the United States, marking the initial phase of a new agreement between the two nations. While three of the deportees wish to return to their home countries, four have expressed a desire to remain and build lives in Rwanda. This arrangement follows a similar, though ultimately scrapped, deal Rwanda had with Britain, drawing criticism from rights groups who warn of potential violations of international law. An anonymous Rwandan activist suggested the deal is driven by financial incentives and political leverage, particularly concerning ongoing peace negotiations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

          <p>A Court of Appeal hearing is underway regarding an injunction that seeks to prevent asylum seekers from being accommodated at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, following a High Court order for their removal. Lawyers for the Home Office and the hotel argue that this ruling risks setting a damaging precedent, potentially hindering the government's ability to house asylum seekers and fulfill its legal obligations. The case has drawn significant public attention, including protests, especially after a migrant previously housed there was charged with sexual assault. The appeal aims to overturn the injunction, citing potential hardship for those displaced.</p>

Over 18 such explosions have been reported as the fire consumes vegetation in what was once a tank training ground. The blaze, which has scorched approximately 10 square miles, is exacerbated by an unusually hot and dry summer, potentially the hottest on record for the UK. While recent rainfall has aided containment efforts, crews maintain a "very defensive" strategy due to the hidden ordnance, though no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>A new Stanford study indicates that artificial intelligence is predominantly displacing entry-level workers in fields highly exposed to AI, such as software engineering and customer service, where employment for early-career individuals has dropped by 13% since 2022. The research suggests that younger workers' "book learning" often overlaps with generative AI capabilities, while older, more experienced employees possess valuable "tacit knowledge" less susceptible to automation. The article advises young workers to learn how to effectively leverage AI to augment their skills, as the technology is creating new jobs even as it renders others obsolete.

Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier will receive the maximum £3,750 discount, with 26 other models qualifying for £1,500. This initiative, part of a £650 million program spanning three years, seeks to make EVs more financially accessible by aligning their prices closer to petrol and diesel counterparts. The scheme addresses key barriers like upfront costs and the need for more charging points, supporting the UK's goal to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2030.</p>
