          <h2>Hospice Staff Share Views on Assisted Dying Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 00:30:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live to medically end their lives in England and Wales. A key concern among hospice staff is how legalizing assisted dying would affect their services and funding. Many feel passionately about patient choice but are unsure about administering medication to end someone's life. Hospices rely heavily on charitable donations, and there are concerns that palliative care funding would be deprioritized if the bill passes, potentially impacting the quality of end-of-life care. The article emphasizes the importance of respecting patient choice while ensuring access to comprehensive palliative care. </p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the shooting of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, has been arrested.

Boelter surrendered to law enforcement in a wooded area near his farm, and a hat believed to belong to him was found near his vehicle. The suspect is accused of disguising himself as a police officer to gain entry to the lawmakers' homes, and authorities found a target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats in his vehicle. </p>

          <p>Japan is shifting to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to proactively protect key systems and sensitive industrial data. The government has enacted legislation allowing it to track online communications data and take early action against harmful servers.

The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness of 1.16 million nits, exceeding the brightest commercial display screens. Durable and efficient PeLEDs could be used in commercial applications to create low-cost, ultra-bright lighting and high-end display screens. </p>
