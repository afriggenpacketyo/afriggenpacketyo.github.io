          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will no longer be allowed to compete in women's football in England starting June 1st. This decision follows amendments to the FA's rules on April 11th, which introduced stricter eligibility criteria for transgender women participating in women's football at all levels. The FA's decision to scrap its previous policy comes after the UK Supreme Court's ruling on April 15th, which stated that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, leading to the new policy that only individuals born biologically female will be permitted to play. The FA has stated that it would review and change its policy if there were material changes in law, science, or the operation of the policy in grassroots football.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) has adjusted its 2025 earnings forecast, anticipating a potential $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's auto tariffs. The Detroit automaker now projects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to be between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, a decrease from the previous guidance of $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion. GM CEO Mary Barra stated that the company's business remains fundamentally strong as it adapts to the new trade policy environment and strengthens its supply base. The updated guidance considers the positive impact of recent tariff changes, including reimbursements for some U.S. parts and reduced tariff stacking.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal aimed at bringing significant investment to Ukraine to help rebuild the country following the war with Russia. The agreement, made public by Ukraine's government, does not include the security guarantees that Kyiv had long sought, but it opens the door for Ukraine to eventually join the European Union. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the agreement sends a clear message to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. Analysts suggest that the deal could ensure Mr. Trump's continued interest in Ukraine, as his business mindset shapes his approach to politics.</p>

          <p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) chief Kazuo Ueda stated that the central bank will continue to pursue interest rate hikes despite economic uncertainty stemming from U.S. tariffs, which have prompted the BOJ to lower its growth and inflation outlooks. The BOJ revised down its forecasts, taking into account tariff levels imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, though Tokyo has urged Washington to reconsider the policy. The central bank maintained its short-term policy interest rate at around 0.5 percent for the second consecutive meeting. The BOJ now expects to stably achieve its 2 percent inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028, a year later than its previous forecast.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris faced social media backlash for an analogy about elephants during a recent speech in California. Speaking at Emerge's 20th anniversary gala in San Francisco, Harris described a video of elephants at the San Diego Zoo during an earthquake, where the animals formed a circle to protect the vulnerable. She used this as a metaphor to encourage Democrats to connect with each other in the face of division and fear. Social media users criticized the digression as bizarre and inappropriate in the context of her speech, which focused on President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.</p>

An executive order exempts collective bargaining at several federal departments for over 1 million workers, citing national security. Lawsuits have been filed against federal unions, leading to legal challenges and bipartisan opposition in Congress. Union leaders argue these actions are part of an authoritarian effort to undermine opposition and eliminate collective bargaining in the federal sector.

          <p>Wang Shouwen, China’s former vice-minister of commerce and key trade negotiator during the first Trump administration, has transitioned to a less prominent role at the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC). This move follows the appointment of Li Chenggang as Wang's replacement, amidst renewed trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The reasons for Wang's transfer from the high-stakes position remain unclear, though it may indicate a winding down of his career, as he is still six years away from the typical retirement age for ministerial-level officials.</p>

          <p>The 151st Kentucky Derby is approaching, where the winner will receive $3.1 million from a $5 million purse. Bank of America's Steven Mason, specializing in equestrian clients, notes that horses are both a lifestyle and, for some, an investment. However, Mason cautions that horses are illiquid assets with uncertain returns, emphasizing that owners should view it as an enjoyable pursuit, regardless of financial gains. While many owners grew up with horses, an increasing number of entrepreneurs and hedge fund managers are becoming first-time owners after liquidity events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has seen a significant shift in cryptocurrency regulations, with the industry celebrating what they view as a "180 pivot" from the Biden years. Actions such as the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the rollback of SEC enforcement tactics, and key appointments have fostered a more welcoming environment for crypto in Washington, D.C. Jonathan Gould at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has signaled support for issuing new bank charters to crypto firms, while Paul Atkins, the new chair of the SEC, has begun working directly with crypto stakeholders to craft guidance on token issuance.</p>

The BBC has rejected Adams' claims, stating that the program followed its editorial guidelines and was the product of responsible journalism.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW examines the role of sport in Nazi Germany, highlighting its use for physical education to promote health and performance for the national economy and military fitness. Individual sports were secondary to collective activities aimed at strengthening the "national body." The Nazis initially opposed international competitive sport but later organized the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes. While boxing was promoted for boys, sporting activities for women were influenced by ideology, focusing on their roles as mothers and housewives. Jewish athletes were gradually excluded from sports clubs, leading to the formation of purely Jewish sports clubs.</p>
