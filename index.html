          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Pollution from Water Companies by 2030</h2>

          <p>UK environment secretary Steve Reed has pledged to halve sewage discharges from water companies by 2030, marking the first clear target on the issue. This commitment follows public outrage over pollution and official data showing a 60% increase in serious incidents in 2024. The government's plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution, though critics point out the pledge is not legally binding and relies on company cooperation.</p>

          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall across South Korea have resulted in at least 14 fatalities and left 12 other people missing, according to government reports. The severe weather triggered landslides, flash floods, and building collapses, with the southern town of Sancheong being particularly hard-hit. As of Sunday, approximately 3,840 people remained evacuated from their homes, although the rain has since subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted nationwide.</p>

          <p>Manny Pacquiao's highly anticipated return to boxing after a four-year retirement ended in a majority draw against WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. While one judge scored the bout for Barrios, the other two ruled it even, allowing Barrios to retain his title. The 46-year-old Pacquiao, who showed glimpses of his vintage form, felt he won the close contest and has already called for a rematch.</p>

          <p>In a significant positive development following recent Texas floods, the number of people listed as missing in hard-hit Kerr County has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Officials attributed this sharp decrease to diligent follow-up work by various agencies that successfully verified the safety of most individuals.
