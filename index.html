            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported based on allegations from the Trump administration that he threatens foreign policy. The judge sided with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that Khalil's presence poses "adverse foreign policy consequences". Khalil's lawyers have been given until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation, with potential destinations being Syria or Algeria. The ACLU-NJ has criticized the ruling as a dangerous departure from fundamental freedoms and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent.</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 death of her husband, Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors argued that she masterminded the crime with her lover, Robert Baker, who previously pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life without parole. The case involved accusations of a love affair, secret communications, and a staged crime scene. Baker has since claimed Sementilli had no knowledge of his plan to kill her husband, though prosecutors presented evidence of their ongoing relationship and coded communications while incarcerated.</p>

            <p>Stocks closed higher on Friday, marking their best weekly performance since November 2023, despite ongoing concerns about the trade war between the US and China. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw gains, driven by investors temporarily setting aside trade tensions. China's announcement of increased tariffs on US goods was met with caution, as economists warned about the potential impact on corporate profits and the broader economy. Consumer confidence remains low, reflecting investor concerns about the effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump is threatening Mexico with new tariffs over its failure to deliver water under a 1944 treaty, citing harm to Texas farmers. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum attributes the shortfall to a severe drought but vows to deliver a "significant amount" soon. The dispute adds to strained US-Mexico relations, with Trump already imposing tariffs on Mexico for immigration and fentanyl issues. Experts note that the water shortage is hydrologically determined and question the effectiveness of trade threats.</p>

OpenAI has filed a countersuit seeking punitive damages and an injunction to prevent Musk from interfering in its operations.</p>

            <p>High-level delegations from the United States and Iran are meeting in Oman to discuss Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, marking the first direct conversations in seven years. The meeting occurs amid growing concerns that Iran's breakout time for producing a nuclear weapon has significantly decreased. Despite opening communication, the Trump administration maintains a hardline stance, threatening military action if a deal is not reached. The talks are seen as a critical opportunity for both sides, given economic pressures on Iran and the need to address nuclear proliferation concerns.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors and attorneys for the Menendez brothers clashed in court over a resentencing recommendation that could potentially free the brothers. Newly elected D.A. Nathan Hochman seeks to spike a prior recommendation from his predecessor to resentence the brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents. The defense argued that Hochman is playing politics with the siblings' lives, while prosecutors displayed graphic crime scene photos and argued that the brothers haven't taken full responsibility for their crimes. The judge will decide whether to resentence the brothers at a hearing on April 17.</p>

Despite a talented cast and stylish execution, the film lacks suspense and surprise, with a predictable plot and underutilized supporting characters. While the film aims for emotional depth, it falls short in developing its characters and creating a compelling mystery, resulting in a dull and uninspired narrative.</p>
