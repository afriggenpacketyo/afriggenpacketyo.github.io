          <h2>Heathrow Airport Power Outage Traced to Moisture in Electrical System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 02:19:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review has concluded that a power outage at Heathrow Airport, caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation, was "most likely" due to moisture entering an electrical component. This significant incident, which began late on March 20, led to Heathrow's decision to close the following day, resulting in thousands of cancelled flights and stranding around 270,000 passengers and commercial customers. The National Energy System Operator (NESO) was tasked by the energy secretary to investigate, finding that electricity likely "arced" and ignited oil after a short circuit within the system. The report details how a critical mechanical device called bushing, essential for tempering electrical energy between two parts, was compromised, leading to the widespread disruption.</p>

          <p>China is strategically investing heavily in Africa's copper sector, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Botswana, to secure vital supplies for the global green energy transition. Copper is emerging as a crucial element for EV batteries, solar systems, and defense, prompting Beijing's proactive approach amidst Western restrictions on Chinese acquisition of critical mineral assets. Chinese companies are aggressively expanding their footprint, exemplified by JCHX Mining's acquisition and significant investment in Zambia's Lubambe Copper Mine, calling it "strategically pivotal." This initiative aims to bolster China's supply chain resilience and leadership in new energy industries, despite geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government faced significant humiliation and chaos after a welfare reform vote, revealing a lack of control over the Commons reminiscent of past turbulent parliamentary periods. Despite holding a mandate and majority, swathes of Labour MPs rebelled, forcing a major U-turn on proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) eligibility criteria. The incident exposed deep anxieties within Downing Street and led to widespread questioning of Starmer's leadership and the stability of his cabinet. This deeply damaging episode highlights internal party divisions and the urgent challenge for Starmer to regain control and demonstrate decisive leadership.</p>

Separately, House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed uncertainty about achieving full attendance for a crucial vote on President Trump's policy bill due to widespread flight cancellations caused by severe weather across the US.

Republicans largely support the bill as a crucial compromise to fulfill Trump's campaign promises, encompassing priorities on taxes, border security, defense, and energy. However, Democrats vehemently criticize the 900-page legislation as a tax cut for the wealthy that would add trillions to the national debt and significantly harm Medicaid. Despite some Republican reservations and potential attendance issues due to adverse weather, House leaders aim to get the controversial bill to Trump's desk by Independence Day.

          <p>A recent G7 agreement has drawn sharp criticism for exempting US multinationals from the global minimum tax (Pillar Two), a deal reportedly influenced by President Trump and corporate lobbying. Critics argue this decision undermines the worldwide implementation of the 15% minimum tax rate, which was designed to curb harmful tax competition and ensure large corporations pay their fair share. This move is perceived as prioritizing corporate profits over the interests of developing countries and global citizens, potentially incentivizing companies to relocate official headquarters to the US. The article suggests this action weakens international tax cooperation and compromises the integrity of inclusive global frameworks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EU-China relations remain fundamentally strained despite ongoing summits, with significant divisions persisting over economic imbalances and China's unwavering embrace of Russia. Senior EU officials express frustration that China tends to portray the relationship as problem-free, while Brussels is actively seeking to rebalance it for its own advantage. The European Union faces additional pressure to finalize a trade deal with the United States by July 9 to avoid impending tariffs, further complicating its already challenging diplomatic agenda. Policymakers are bracing for difficult conversations, indicating that the anticipated "reset" in EU-China relations has not materialized, as deep-seated issues continue to strain ties.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric car startup Xpeng reported robust sales in June, delivering 34,611 cars, marking its eighth consecutive month with over 30,000 deliveries. This strong performance stands out amidst an intensifying EV price war in China, a situation that has drawn criticism from President Xi Jinping for promoting "disorderly competition." While Xpeng's U.S.-listed rivals like Zeekr, Nio, and Li Auto saw more modest or declining sales momentum, BYD continues to dominate the market.

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a "30% or 35%" tariff on Japan if a comprehensive trade deal is not finalized by next week's deadline, a rate significantly higher than current levies. This threat follows a previous "Liberation Day" tariff announcement and a subsequent 90-day pause for negotiations, which Trump does not intend to extend. Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary declined to comment directly on the threat, maintaining a cautious stance. Trump specifically criticized Japan's refusal to import US rice despite a domestic shortage, publicly casting doubt on the likelihood of an agreement. The UK remains the only country to have struck a deal with the US since these tariffs were initiated. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors had pushed for an Allen charge to encourage a unanimous decision, a controversial instruction that some believe can exert undue pressure.

Thousands of active-duty troops have been deployed to construct barriers and temporarily detain migrants, while ICE has increased arrests in the interior of the country.

          <h2>Tesla Shares Fall Amidst Elon Musk and President Trump Feud Over "Big Beautiful Bill"</h2>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 7% drop ahead of its second-quarter deliveries report, largely influenced by a renewed public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Musk criticized the legislation for potentially increasing the national debt by trillions and cutting crucial support for renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credits, which could significantly impact Tesla's sales and energy division. Trump retaliated by suggesting Musk could lose lucrative government contracts that his various businesses, like SpaceX, heavily rely on. This high-profile spat highlights the financial implications of the bill and the complex, often volatile, relationship between prominent tech leaders and political figures.

          <p>President Donald Trump's 940-page "big, beautiful bill," also known as HR 1, has ignited fierce debate due to its ambitious scope and the political maneuvering surrounding its passage. The legislation, central to Trump's second-term agenda, proposes permanent tax cuts, expanded child tax credits, small business support, and significant funding for defense and border security, including the construction of the border wall. However, it also includes controversial restrictions on Medicaid and cuts to other healthcare and nutrition programs. Critics, including Elon Musk, argue it will drastically increase the national debt, leading to a public feud between Trump and Musk and a notable split within Republican ranks.
