          <p>A shooting in Manhattan's Times Square left three people injured, including two innocent bystanders. The incident reportedly began as a fight involving a group of teenagers inside a restaurant before spilling outside, where a 17-year-old allegedly opened fire. The New York City Police Department responded quickly, arresting the teenage suspect after a short pursuit and recovering a firearm. The victims, a 19-year-old who was the intended target and two bystanders aged 18 and 65, were all hospitalized in stable condition.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting official during a preseason game, despite not playing. While standing on the edge of the sideline in street clothes, Lamb was struck from behind by an official who was tracking a play downfield. Although Lamb was uninjured and laughed off the incident, the Cowboys received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for a non-player making contact with an official. The penalty occurred during the second quarter of the game against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>A detailed investigation into the 2022 death of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old Minnesota nurse, culminated in the murder conviction of Matthew Ecker. Initially, Ecker, a former colleague with whom Pennig had an affair, claimed she had taken her own life in her bathroom after an argument with her current boyfriend. However, detectives uncovered numerous inconsistencies in his story, including that a piece of the broken door lock was found under her body, suggesting a forced entry before the shot was fired. Ecker was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera sustained a torn achilles tendon during the New York Yankees’ Old-Timers’ Day game. The 55-year-old legendary closer was injured while moving to field a fly ball in shallow center field and will require surgery. This injury is reminiscent of his 2012 season-ending ACL tear, which also occurred during a pre-game practice. Rivera, baseball's all-time saves leader, was participating in the celebratory event for the second time, having previously hit an inside-the-park home run in the 2019 game.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams' preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys showcased the potential of their running back corps, particularly rookie Blake Corum. With the team looking to manage the workload of star rusher Kyren Williams, Corum made a strong case for a larger role by scoring two touchdowns and gaining 32 yards. Other running backs, including Jarquez Hunter and Cody Schrader, also performed well, while quarterback Stetson Bennett showed confidence in his extended playing time. The game provided a positive outlook on the Rams' offensive depth heading into the regular season.</p>

          <p>The 'quiet luxury' trend of understated, logo-free fashion is giving way to a resurgence of 'loud luxury,' characterized by bold branding and distinctive designs. As the luxury sector faces slowing sales after a post-pandemic boom, major fashion houses like Gucci and Burberry are shifting their creative direction to inject novelty and reignite consumer desire. Analysts suggest this cyclical change is a strategy to appeal to weary shoppers and regain market relevance, especially for brands that struggled while ultra-luxe, subtle labels thrived. This shift could signal a turning point for the industry, moving away from discrete opulence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown. A combination of factors, including changing consumer habits, post-pandemic inflation, and global trade tariffs, has contributed to declining sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey. The boom period led to an oversupply as distilleries ramped up production, and now economic pressures and retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada are causing bankruptcies and consolidation within the industry. This downturn marks a sharp reversal from the recent past when bourbon was a celebrated and rapidly growing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new adaptation of 'War of the Worlds' starring Ice Cube has been widely panned by critics, earning a near-0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and sparking a conversation about why audiences are often drawn to terrible movies. The article suggests that universally disliked films can be more intriguing and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. For many viewers, there is a charm in watching an earnestly made but flawed film, leading to a 'so bad it's good' cult following. This phenomenon explains why a movie's terrible reputation can sometimes generate more curiosity and viewership than positive reviews.</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the tech landscape, despite no longer dominating headlines. Its initial success challenged the 'bigger is better' philosophy in AI development, proving that capable models could be built with fewer resources, which jolted Silicon Valley. While security concerns about its Chinese origins persist, some US startups continue to use DeepSeek to cut costs. The app's arrival also intensified the US-China AI rivalry, serving as a 'Sputnik moment' that spurred American investment and policy focus on maintaining dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The gunman who opened fire on the CDC campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer, reportedly believed the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal, according to a law enforcement official. The suspect, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was killed during the incident after firing dozens of rounds into four CDC buildings. In response, a group of former CDC employees criticized Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken vaccine skeptic, arguing his rhetoric has fueled hostility against public health workers.

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have expressed regret after a collaborative shoe design sparked accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The government complained that the 'Oaxaca Slip-On' sandal was a reinterpretation of the traditional huarache sandals unique to the region, without partnership or compensation for the Indigenous community. Following the controversy, Chavarria apologized, and Adidas stated it is seeking to meet with local officials to 'repair the damage.'

President Donald Trump, in turn, suggested that Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt it from potential future tariffs on imported chips. This development eased investor fears about the potential negative impact of tariffs on Apple's profitability, contributing to the significant stock rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London police arrested 365 people during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian organization recently banned by the British government. Supporters intentionally violated the new law, which criminalizes public support for the group, by displaying signs and daring police to arrest them as a form of civil disobedience. The protest was organized to challenge the ban, which activists argue illegally restricts freedom of expression. The government banned Palestine Action after its members vandalized military aircraft to protest the UK's support for Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>
