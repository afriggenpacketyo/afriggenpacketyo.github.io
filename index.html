          <h2>US Asks China to Prevent Iran from Closing Strait of Hormuz</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:12:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route. This request follows reports that Iran's parliament approved a plan to potentially close the strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Closure of the Strait of Hormuz could severely disrupt global oil supplies, significantly impacting China, which is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. Experts suggest Iran risks alienating its neighbors and key markets like China by disrupting traffic through the Strait. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newspaper front pages are dominated by the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with headlines reflecting concerns about potential retaliation and the broader implications for global security. The Financial Times highlights the US administration's claim that it is targeting Iran's nuclear program, not the country itself, while describing the attack as a "gamble." Other papers emphasize Iran's vow to retaliate, the potential for a drawn-out conflict, and the increased terror threat in the UK. Amidst the international tensions, the UK government expresses surprise at the speed of the US action, and world leaders call for de-escalation and diplomacy.</p>

Iran's Foreign Minister stated that his nation "reserves all options" in responding to the attack, while Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised the decision. The United Nations Secretary-General warned that the strikes represent a dangerous escalation with catastrophic consequences, and China condemned the US action, singling out Israel for criticism.

          <p>New York City is employing ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that even if a voter's top choice lacks sufficient support, their subsequent rankings still influence the outcome. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed based on voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate achieves a majority, and the results won't be official until mid-July due to the arrival of mail-in ballots.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its ability to observe the universe in unprecedented detail. The telescope features the world's most powerful digital camera and promises to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos. Scientists anticipate that the observatory will discover a ninth planet in our solar system within its first year of operation. The telescope will repeatedly capture the night sky for ten years, every three days, for a Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump asserted that the term "obliteration" accurately describes the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities following recent strikes. This statement contradicts attempts to downplay the extent of the damage. General Dan Caine stated that there was "severe damage and destruction" to the facilities, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth affirmed that the precision munitions struck their intended targets with the desired effect. The UN nuclear watchdog chief has adopted a cautious tone, stating that it is not yet possible to fully assess the damage at the Fordo nuclear facility.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased uncertainty as the US becomes involved in the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. Experts warn of the possibility of triple-digit oil prices, with investors closely monitoring Iran's reaction to US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz have further fueled market jitters, as the strait is a critical artery for global oil trade. Analysts suggest that a prolonged closure or disruption of key Gulf energy infrastructure could push crude prices above $100 per barrel. (not investment advice)</p>
