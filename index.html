            <p>The Unite union in Birmingham is urging the City Council to formalize its public statements regarding worker pay in writing to resolve the ongoing bin dispute. The union claims that while council leader John Cotton has stated that Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) workers will not lose pay when moving "sideways," this assurance hasn't been guaranteed long-term. Hundreds of workers began striking on March 11, leading to significant waste accumulation, and the union rejected the council's latest offer on Monday. The union is seeking written guarantees to prevent pay cuts for drivers and ensure fair compensation for WRCO workers who do not wish to move sideways.</p>

            <p>Consumer spending in the United States exceeded expectations in March, with retail sales increasing by 1.4%, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 1.2%.

Excluding autos, sales rose by 0.5%, also exceeding the forecast of 0.3%.

            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York cautioned that borrowers who are late on their student loan payments would experience significant drops in their credit scores. The end of the pandemic-era forbearance on federal student loans, which had marked all delinquent loans as current, is a key factor. Researchers expect millions of borrowers to face substantial declines in credit standing, which could result in reduced credit limits and higher interest rates. Average nationwide credit scores are falling due to rising credit card balances and an uptick in missed payments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Harvard University is facing scrutiny after the White House froze billions in federal funding due to the university's alleged failure to adequately address antisemitism. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the university's independence, arguing that the government shouldn't dictate academic matters. Critics, however, argue that Harvard is fighting the Trump administration harder than it has fought antisemitism on its own campus. The debate raises questions about the balance between academic freedom and the responsibility of universities to ensure the safety and inclusion of all students.</p>

            <p>Artists are expressing outrage over AI companies using their work to train AI systems without consent or compensation, arguing that this practice inflicts moral injury. Moral injury occurs when individuals feel forced to violate their own values, leading to shame, anxiety, and depression. Artists believe that having their images and words used to enable a project they fundamentally oppose contributes to the "enshittification" of the world. By framing their objection in terms of moral injury, artists challenge the narrative that AI innovation is essential to progress and beneficial to humanity.</p>

            <p>Supplies of new and used vehicles in the U.S. are rapidly decreasing as consumers rush to purchase cars and trucks ahead of potential price increases due to tariffs. The days' supply of new vehicles dropped significantly in March, while used vehicle supply also declined. This surge in sales is beneficial for the automotive industry but raises concerns about a potential halt once tariff-free inventories are depleted. Analysts anticipate that higher production costs and tariffs could lead to a decrease in vehicle sales in the U.S. and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that doctors involved in two end-of-life cases can be named, after the parents of the deceased children sought to "tell their story". The court emphasized the importance of freedom of speech and stated that restrictions must be convincingly established. The ruling comes after disputes over life support treatment for two children at the High Court in London. The parents expressed their desire to share their experiences and hold the medical professionals accountable.</p>
