          <p>Ray French, a celebrated dual-code rugby international and the iconic voice of rugby league for the BBC, has passed away at the age of 85. After a distinguished playing career for St Helens, Widnes, England, and Great Britain, French transitioned to broadcasting, becoming the lead commentator for the BBC in 1981. For nearly four decades, his enthusiastic and distinctive commentary defined the sport for a generation of fans, covering numerous major finals and thousands of matches. His immense contribution was recognized with an MBE and a place on the Rugby Football League's Roll of Honour, leaving a lasting legacy in the sport.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Voters Reject Mass Recall of Opposition KMT Lawmakers</h2>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale attempt to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The result is a significant setback for President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped the recall could help it regain a parliamentary majority lost in the recent elections. The KMT, which advocates for closer ties with Beijing, framed the recall effort as a political power grab following their legislative victories. The failure of the recall maintains the current political balance, where the KMT and its allies control the legislature and can obstruct the president's agenda.</p>

          <p>Violent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have intensified, entering a third day and resulting in at least 33 deaths and the displacement of over 168,000 people. Both nations have traded accusations of initiating attacks involving artillery and gunfire, expanding the conflict zone along their long-disputed frontier. The conflict has prompted international calls for a ceasefire, with the UN Security Council urging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to mediate. Human Rights Watch has condemned the use of cluster munitions in populated areas and called for both sides to protect civilians amid the escalating violence.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees superstar Aaron Judge was unexpectedly scratched from the lineup for Saturday's game due to an elbow issue, raising concerns for the team. Manager Aaron Boone confirmed that Judge experienced discomfort while throwing during the previous day's game, which prompted an MRI. The team is currently awaiting the results of the imaging to determine the severity of the injury. The potential loss of the reigning American League MVP comes at a challenging time for the Yankees, who have recently struggled with four losses in their last ten games.</p>

          <p>A small but growing movement of young Israelis is choosing to face imprisonment and social ostracism by refusing mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Citing moral objections to the ongoing war in Gaza and the broader occupation, these conscientious objectors, known as "refusers," are challenging a core tenet of Israeli society. The article profiles several teenagers who have burned their draft letters and accepted jail sentences, describing the loss of friendships and family strain. While their numbers remain on the fringe, they hope their actions will inspire others to question the conflict.</p>

          <p>A provision in the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act has made a key student loan benefit permanent, potentially encouraging more employers to help workers pay down their debt. The law solidifies the tax-free status of employer contributions up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans, a measure first introduced temporarily in the CARES Act. With federal repayment options narrowing, this workplace benefit is seen as an increasingly vital tool for attracting and retaining talent. While only a small percentage of companies currently offer it, experts predict adoption will grow now that the tax uncertainty is resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," and its hit single "Daisies" are being analyzed as a reflection of a broader cultural mood favoring more subdued, melancholic music this summer. The article suggests that unlike the high-energy pop of previous years, the current landscape is dominated by downtempo, reserved, and sometimes sad-sounding tracks. Bieber's album departs from his past work, embracing a softer, R&B-influenced sound with aqueous, muffled production. This trend is seen as a potential indicator of a collective cultural malaise or hangover, with listeners gravitating toward soothing, introspective music rather than upbeat party anthems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has survived a recent attempt to rescind $400 million of its funding, but its long-term future remains uncertain. The program, credited with saving 26 million lives since 2003, faced significant disruptions when the Trump administration halted most foreign aid earlier this year, causing some clinics to close. While Congress protected its current funding, the administration has proposed major cuts for next year and has already stopped most HIV prevention work. Experts worry about the program's ability to function without its full range of services and with its congressional authorization still expired.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered to combat the spread of dengue fever. These "Wolbitos" are infected with a naturally occurring bacteria called Wolbachia, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the mosquito, thereby stopping its transmission to humans. A successful pilot program in the city of Niterói saw dengue cases plummet by roughly 90%. Now, with a new, massive factory capable of producing billions of the modified insects, the Brazilian government aims to deploy this innovative strategy across the country to fight dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the initiative, which comes as Israel agrees to allow such air deliveries amid a worsening humanitarian crisis. This move coincides with increasing domestic political pressure on the UK government, as over 220 MPs signed a letter urging the formal recognition of a Palestinian state. Aid organizations maintain that airdrops are insufficient and that opening all land borders is the only way to avert a man-made famine.</p>

The study evaluated all 50 states based on 15 metrics, weighted according to what Americans prioritize, including affordability, healthcare, safety, and weather. Six of the bottom ten states are in the South, with factors like natural disasters significantly degrading the weather scores for Gulf Coast states. The report also highlights that personal preference is key, as a state's low ranking in one area, like Wyoming's for entertainment, might be offset by its top ranking for tax-friendliness.
