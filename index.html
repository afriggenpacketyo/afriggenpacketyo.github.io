            <p>This article examines how Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has systematically dismantled democratic checks and balances, consolidated power within his Fidesz party, and taken control of media, civil society, and universities. Critics allege corruption through lucrative contracts awarded to cronies, funded in part by EU funds before they were frozen. The article draws parallels between Orban's tactics and those of Vladimir Putin, as well as concerns about the pace of similar actions in the United States. The article also discusses how the government is targeting LGBTQ+ rights and freedom of assembly.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>While tongue-scraping is growing in popularity as a dental hygiene practice, some experts are raising concerns about its potential impact on heart health. Dr. Bradley Serwer cautions that tongue-scraping can cause microscopic cuts, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Dr. Whitney White advises moderation, as over-scraping can disrupt the balance of beneficial microbes and lower nitric oxide levels, potentially leading to high blood pressure. Experts emphasize that tongue-scraping should not replace brushing and flossing, which are more critical for maintaining healthy gums.</p>

            <p>Christians around the world are celebrating Easter, with both Orthodox and Western churches observing the holiday on the same day this year, which is not always the case. The article showcases images of celebrations from Greece, where the sky lit up with fireworks, to Jerusalem, where worshippers lit candles at a significant church. This rare synchronicity of Easter dates strengthens the will to continue on the path toward church unity, according to Bishop Grigorije Duric, head of Serbian Orthodox Christians in Germany.</p>

            <p>China is exhibiting a subtle shift in its foreign policy by wading into the conflict between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, a departure from its usual non-interference approach. Beijing has directly urged Kigali to cease its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw Rwandan troops from the DRC, even voting in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role. Observers suggest this deviation is motivated by Beijing's desire to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both nations. This demonstrates China's calculated approach to balancing its economic priorities with its diplomatic strategies in Africa.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily halting deliveries to American consumers for shipments valued over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The changes have led to a surge in formal customs clearances, causing multi-day delays for affected shipments. The White House is also set to close a loophole on May 2, impacting companies like Shein and Temu by removing the "de minimis" rule, which allowed low-value packages to enter the US without duties. These measures are purportedly aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain.</p>

            <p>A Canadian writer reflects on the changing perception of America, contrasting past experiences of openness and generosity with current realities of stricter border controls and political division. The author recalls a time when entering the U.S. was effortless, but now expresses reluctance to return due to perceived erosion of freedoms and values. The piece explores the idea of America as a land of illusions, both magnificent and treacherous, and laments the loss of the country's unique spirit of fun and opportunity. The author keeps his memories of America in a genizah in his mind, the ones he has written here but also: dawn over the Shenandoah seen from the flatbed of an F-150; Broadway Boogie Woogie by Piet Modrian in the MoMA; a New Orleans band that must have played When the Saints Go Marching In 10,000 times playing it as if it were the first time; the smell of tacos al pastor in a Tulsa parking lot; low-limit craps in Vegas; a western oriole strutting in pine needles; the stump of the “Tree of Hope” in Harlem; the Siesta Key Oyster Bar, where the walls were covered with Iraqi money stapled there by returning soldiers; the sausages at the Wrigley Field ballpark in Chicago; the New York hustler who went down the A train selling his romance novels out of a box; that wave at the border I may have half-imagined.</p>

            <p>This article details how an Oregon police officer's offer of a cigarette led to a confession and the discovery of a body in the case of Aaron Friar's disappearance.

Jones confessed to helping dispose of the body but claimed he was not responsible for the murder, shifting blame to Gavin MacFarlane.

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are expected to increase their market share in China this year, driven by Chinese consumers' growing preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Fresh durians, transported by air within 48 hours of pickup, are especially popular among affluent consumers. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree, enhancing their appeal. Improved logistics and steady supply have further boosted Malaysia's durian exports to China, creating significant opportunities for local growers.</p>
