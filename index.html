          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney curtailed President Trump's Q&A session with reporters ahead of the G7 summit. Trump addressed topics like Russia's exclusion from the G8 and the Israel-Iran conflict, also reiterating his stance on expanding ICE efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants in major cities. He suggested Iran wants de-escalation and mentioned trade negotiations with Canada, expressing a preference for tariffs. Trump defended Russia's inclusion in global talks, suggesting its absence complicated matters, while Carney cited his role as G7 chair to steer the meeting toward key issues.</p>

His comments followed a social media post where he called for ICE to maximize efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants, while also acknowledging the need for undocumented workers in the farming and hospitality industries.

          <p>A new report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities have avoided discussing the ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators. The report found that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, making it difficult to draw conclusions at a national level. Despite this, local data from Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire indicate a disproportionate number of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects. The report criticizes the failure to understand the nature and scale of the problem, attributing it to ignorance and fear of being seen as racist. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper apologized to victims and announced a new national inquiry into grooming gangs.</p>

Iran's reliance on hydrocarbons makes it a major player in the global energy sector, but sanctions have crippled its economy, preventing it from modernizing its oil and gas sectors.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston extended legal relief to Harvard University in its fight against the Trump administration's effort to halt the entry of Harvard students coming from overseas. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order until June 23 while she considers issuing a longer-term injunction. The Trump administration's proclamation cited the university's engagement with China and other national security concerns. Harvard argued the proclamation violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, addressing the Israel-Iran conflict and trade tensions with allies. He stated that Iran wants to de-escalate the conflict and needs to make a deal, while confirming he has seen messages from Iran through intermediaries. The meeting took place as Trump's aides negotiated with allies over tariffs he has imposed, and he suggested considering China's inclusion in the group. He also brought up Vladimir Putin's ouster from the group in 2014, stating Putin only speaks to him.</p>

          <p>A review into abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales highlights flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the scale of the issue. The report points to a lack of reliable data on ethnicity, with the ethnicity of perpetrators not recorded in two-thirds of cases. The report recommends tightening laws so adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault, and calls for a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation. The review also notes a significant proportion of live cases appear to involve suspects who are non-UK nationals or claiming asylum in the UK.</p>
