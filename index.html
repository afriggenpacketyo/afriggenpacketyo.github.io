          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. The agreement also imposes a 40% tariff on products transshipped through Vietnam to circumvent other trade barriers, a practice allegedly used by China. In exchange, the U.S. will gain tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a significant shift from the previous 46% blanket tariff threat. The deal's implementation details remain unclear, but it raises concerns among critics about potential price increases for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The freeze affects after-school programs, teacher training, English language instruction, and other student support services, creating uncertainty for school districts that rely on this funding. The Department of Education stated the funds are under review to ensure alignment with presidential priorities, but critics and educators warn the move could force budget cuts, layoffs, and program closures.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is planning a large-scale effort to combat the New World Screwworm by air-dropping millions of sterilized male flies over parts of Texas and Mexico. This biological control method involves releasing irradiated flies that mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the pest population to decline over time. The initiative follows a recent outbreak in Mexico that led the U.S. to suspend livestock imports from its southern border in May. The flesh-eating larvae of the screwworm fly pose a significant threat to livestock and can also affect humans.</p>

The plea agreement, which includes a waiver of his right to appeal, is expected to result in life imprisonment.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's directive aimed at severely restricting access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president does not have the unilateral authority to supplant immigration laws enacted by Congress. The ruling sided with immigrants' rights groups who argued that the plan, a key part of the administration's hardline immigration agenda, was unlawful. The judge's order has been temporarily stayed for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal the decision to a higher court.</p>

This settlement follows a pattern of major media corporations, including Disney and Meta, making large payouts to resolve legal challenges from Trump.

          <p>Recent layoffs of over 280,000 federal workers, initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could become a significant factor in the upcoming June jobs report. This comes as the broader labor market shows signs of cooling, with weaker demand for white-collar and tech positions, making it challenging for displaced government employees to find new work. While the overall impact has been muted so far, economists note that a surge in job applications from former federal workers coincides with a general slowdown in hiring. The jobs report is expected to show modest growth, with the unemployment rate potentially ticking higher. (not investment advice)</p>

The decline is attributed to increased competition, particularly from Chinese EV makers, and a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill to significantly boost the state's film and television tax credit program, increasing its annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is intended to make California more competitive with other states and countries that offer lucrative incentives, thereby luring back productions and jobs to Hollywood. Industry leaders and unions have praised the increase as a vital step to stimulate production, which has slowed due to strikes, studio spending cuts, and other factors. A related bill is also under consideration to further expand the program's eligibility and credit percentages.</p>

          <p>The former head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Ben Key, has had his service officially terminated following an investigation into his personal conduct. The Ministry of Defence stated that his behavior "fell far short of the values and standards expected of service personnel," reportedly related to an affair with a junior colleague. In a statement, Sir Ben expressed deep regret for his actions and accepted the decision, apologizing to those he had hurt. Although he will retain his knighthood and pension, he has been stripped of his military commission, an unusual step for a senior officer.</p>

Additional costs can include closing costs similar to a mortgage, early termination penalties if the line of credit is closed too soon, and transaction fees for accessing funds.

          <p>Former President Trump's major domestic policy bill, now awaiting a final House vote, bundles together key campaign promises with significant financial implications. The legislation includes massive spending increases for border security and defense, substantial tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and incentives for fossil fuel production. To offset these costs, the bill proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which could cause millions to lose coverage. While a legislative victory for Trump, the bill is projected to add trillions to the national debt, drawing criticism from fiscal conservatives and the public.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the United States is pausing some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing a need to prioritize America's interests and concerns about dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. This decision is part of a broader Pentagon review of military assistance to all foreign countries, initiated by the Trump administration. The specific weapons or the scale of the pullback were not disclosed, but the move has drawn concern from Kyiv. This action follows a period of fluctuating U.S. policy toward aid for Ukraine, which has included previous temporary pauses on military and intelligence support.</p>

          <p>The British House of Commons has voted to proscribe the direct-action group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization under the Terrorism Act 2000. Once the order is signed, membership or public support for the group will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and painted military planes, an act the security minister described as an "atrocious act."

          <p>Ukrainian officials have warned that the U.S. decision to halt some weapons shipments could embolden Russia and prolong the war, now in its fourth year. Following the White House's confirmation of the pause, Ukraine's foreign ministry stated that any delay in military aid would only encourage further aggression from Moscow. The U.S. has been a critical military supplier for Kyiv, and while European allies continue their support, a reduction in American aid is seen as a significant blow. The Kremlin responded to the news by stating that a reduced flow of weapons to Ukraine would help end the conflict more quickly.</p>

          <p>A recent discovery by NASA's Curiosity rover offers new insight into why Mars is uninhabitable, suggesting it was always destined to be a mostly desert world. The rover found rocks rich in carbonate minerals, which trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a key element for planetary warming. Unlike Earth, which has a balanced climate cycle involving volcanic activity, Mars's feeble volcanic outgassing was insufficient to replenish its atmospheric CO2. This imbalance meant that any periods of liquid water on Mars were likely brief, sporadic oases, followed by millions of years of barren, cold conditions inhospitable to life.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, stating the agency lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its previously established expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants had enrolled in schools, taken jobs, and started medical treatments in reliance on the program's continuation.

Combs was acquitted of the most complex and severe charge, racketeering conspiracy (RICO), which would have required prosecutors to prove he directed a criminal enterprise. He was also found not guilty of sex trafficking. However, the jury convicted him on two counts of violating the Mann Act, a century-old law prohibiting the transportation of individuals across state lines for prostitution.

Other evidence includes Barry's suspicious cell phone activity, which he attributed to shooting chipmunks, and a needle cap for a tranquilizer dart found in the family's dryer.
