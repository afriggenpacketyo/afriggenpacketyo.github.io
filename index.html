          <p>Former President Joe Biden spoke at a Memorial Day event in Delaware, marking his first public remarks since announcing his diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer. During the event, Biden remembered his son, Beau Biden, who passed away 10 years prior after battling brain cancer. Biden shared that being with the attendees made the difficult day a little easier and acknowledged the pain of grief, reminding those present that they are not alone in their experiences. Biden's office previously disclosed his cancer diagnosis, noting a Gleason score of 9, the most severe category, and that he was never previously diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating attempts to impersonate White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles through texts and calls to governors, members of Congress, and other individuals. The calls and texts appear to mimic Wiles' voice and occasionally request money, leading authorities to believe an imposter is at work. Wiles is a close advisor to President Trump and managed his 2024 campaign, giving her access to numerous high-ranking officials, and the White House is taking the cybersecurity of its staff seriously during the investigation. The incident follows a previous phishing campaign targeting Trump's campaign by Iran during the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>A suspected drone attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group struck a hospital in El-Obeid, Sudan, resulting in six deaths and at least twelve injuries. The attack, which also targeted residential areas, has rendered the hospital inoperable, with the RSF besieging the city for almost two years before the army broke the siege in February. The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese army has caused a severe humanitarian crisis, leading to widespread hunger and displacement, and the war has effectively split Sudan into two parts. The United Nations has reported that the conflict in Sudan has created the world's biggest hunger and displacement crises.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is pending. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, arguing that the majority has mishandled the assessment and underestimated the severe consequences of disrupting the lives of so many noncitizens. Jackson emphasized that the government seeks to inflict maximum damage before a final decision, while court-ordered stays should minimize harm to litigating parties. This ruling follows a previous decision allowing the Trump administration to revoke the status of nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A paraglider in China survived an accidental ascent to 28,208 feet without oxygen after being caught in a powerful updraft, according to Chinese Central Television (CCTV). Peng Yujiang, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he became trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, experiencing a phenomenon known as "cloud suck." Footage from the flight shows Peng flying through thick clouds as ice formed around his face and equipment, and he was later handed a six-month flight suspension because the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance. Despite the terrifying experience, Peng survived, though he expressed reluctance to fly again in the near future.</p>

The author suggests that a redefined understanding of harm, abuse, and trauma has contributed to an impossibly high standard for parenting, where parents are expected to ensure their children's career success and mental well-being into adulthood. This cultural shift has led to adult children cutting off contact with parents, further complicating the decision to become a parent.</p>

This accusation came after Sheriff Susan Hutson sought to bar District Attorney Jason Williams from investigating the jailbreak, citing political bias due to Williams' support for her opponent in an upcoming reelection bid. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill's office will now lead the investigation into the escape, in which ten inmates, including a convicted killer and a serial escapee, broke out of their cell on May 16.

Recommendations include paying down high-interest credit card debt, securing high-yield savings rates before they decrease, and improving credit scores to qualify for lower interest rates. Consumers can significantly impact their financial well-being by taking these measures, rather than waiting for the Fed to lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>
