          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, priced its IPO at $32 per share, raising approximately $273 million. The company's software assists patients with musculoskeletal injuries and post-surgery rehabilitation remotely, and it experienced a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reporting a net income of $17.1 million. The IPO is closely watched by the digital health sector, which has struggled since 2021, and could signal a broader recovery in tech IPO activity. Hinge Health's IPO marks a significant moment for the digital health sector, which has seen limited public offerings in recent years due to post-Covid slowdowns.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant victory for Republicans. The bill includes tax cuts and amendments aimed at appeasing both moderates and conservatives, such as moving up Medicaid work requirements and increasing the cap on state and local tax deductions. Despite Trump's praise and the House Speaker's goal to have the bill on the president's desk by July 4th, investors showed concern, with major indexes opening lower due to worries about federal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would decrease resources for the lowest-income households while increasing them for the highest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some of its trainers and clothing in the United States starting in early June, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to tariffs. The sportswear giant attributed the increase to regular "price adjustments" amid external factors creating uncertainty. While Nike did not explicitly mention US tariffs, almost all of the company's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by up to $10.</p>

          <p>Alberta, a conservative western province in Canada, is laying the groundwork for a referendum on whether to secede from the country. This comes as Canada navigates a political transition with a new centrist prime minister, Mark Carney, and ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The separatist movement is fueled by grievances over perceived unfair limitations on Alberta's oil and gas resources and a sense of cultural and political divergence from the rest of Canada. While the likelihood of secession is slim due to constitutional hurdles, the referendum push underscores deep-seated regional tensions and economic frustrations.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, based on a right-wing conspiracy theory that white people are being killed in South Africa. During an Oval Office meeting, Trump repeatedly referenced "dead white people" and questioned Ramaphosa's efforts to address the alleged violence. The confrontation has been criticized as a demonstration of Trump's views on race, with critics arguing that he framed himself as a protector of white people and used his platform to elevate claims of white grievance. The NAACP has called Trump's remarks "extremely biased and racist."</p>
