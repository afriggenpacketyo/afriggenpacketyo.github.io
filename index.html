          <p>An Alvarado, Texas police officer was shot in the neck and subsequently released from the hospital following an attack outside an ICE detention facility. Eight armed suspects, some wearing body armor, were taken into custody after allegedly luring law enforcement to the scene with fireworks and vandalizing property. The incident occurred late on the Fourth of July, and the suspects' motive is currently under investigation by local police. The Justice Department has stated it is closely monitoring the situation and has zero tolerance for assaults on federal officers or property.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp in Texas, has been devastated by historic flash floods, resulting in numerous fatalities, including young campers and the camp's director. The Guadalupe River rose with little warning, destroying cabins and leaving a scene of devastation. Among the confirmed dead is eight-year-old Renee Smajstrla, while rescue efforts continue for eleven other missing campers and a counselor. The tragedy highlights the deadly power of the sudden floodwaters that have impacted the entire region, which is home to many youth camps.</p>

          <p>A Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed to make a call on a point-ending shot. The chair umpire, unable to determine if the ball was in or out without the system's input, ordered the point to be replayed, a decision Pavlyuchenkova claimed "stole" the game from her. An All England Club spokesperson attributed the malfunction to operator error and confirmed the umpire followed established protocol. Despite the controversy, Pavlyuchenkova went on to win the match, though she later advocated for video checks.</p>

          <p>Two years after a car crashed into an end-of-term party at a London school, the parents of the two eight-year-old girls killed, Nuria Sajjad and Selena Lau, say they are still waiting for answers. At a remembrance event, they expressed frustration over the long wait for accountability. The driver, who claimed to have no memory of the event, was initially not charged after it was determined she had an epileptic seizure. However, she was re-arrested in January on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after police reviewed the investigation.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, who had served prison sentences for crimes including murder and sexual assault, to South Sudan. The move followed a legal battle and is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand deportations to third countries, as only one of the men is a South Sudanese national. The other men are from countries that reportedly refused to accept them. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that would have required due process hearings, raising concerns about the men's fate in the unstable nation.</p>

          <p>The German Journalists' Association (DJV) has condemned an attack on a Deutsche Welle (DW) correspondent and cameraman by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The crew, who were wearing marked press jackets, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a planned protest; they escaped unharmed, but their vehicle was damaged. DW's Director General and Germany's ambassador to Israel both condemned the attack and called for the safety of journalists and the protection of press freedom to be guaranteed.

          <p>The story of a 7-year-old Libyan girl with cystic fibrosis highlights the country's dire healthcare crisis, which is driving citizens to risk their lives migrating to Europe for treatment. The girl's family undertook the dangerous sea journey to Italy after being unable to get necessary medication in Libya, a country plagued by political instability since 2011. The subsequent social media attention prompted a promise of aid from the Libyan government, but the family says no concrete action has been taken.

          <p>Military experts writing in the official PLA Daily newspaper have suggested that the Chinese military will need to undergo structural changes to effectively counter modern drone threats. The article proposes the eventual establishment of specialized counter-drone combat units capable of rapid responses. In the short term, it suggests integrating counter-drone capabilities into existing forces, such as upgrading electronic warfare units to handle AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming. This focus reflects the increasingly crucial role that unmanned aircraft have played in recent global conflicts, including in Ukraine and between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described efforts by the Trump administration to eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "misguided." In an interview, Burns defended public media, stating that it serves as a vital resource, particularly in rural areas, and provides essential educational and emergency programming. He argued against the perception that PBS is a "left-wing thing" and emphasized that he could not have produced his acclaimed historical documentaries without the unique, long-term support PBS provides. The House has already approved a White House request to claw back funding.</p>

The EU is now aiming for a "framework deal," similar to the one secured by the UK, acknowledging that a comprehensive agreement is unattainable. European industries are bracing for higher costs.

The city, founded between 1,800 and 1,500 BC, likely connected early coastal communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides insight into the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was impacted by climate change. The site contains 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, where ceremonial objects and clay sculptures were unearthed.</p>
