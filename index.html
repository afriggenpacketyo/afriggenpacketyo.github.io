          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL), the world's largest EV battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, highlighting the ongoing boom in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly the largest global listing of the year, with funds aimed at building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a recent revenue drop due to intense competition in China, CATL's net profit increased, signaling continued growth in the EV sector. The company has faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers concerned about potential national security risks.</p>

          <p>The second week of Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial commenced with testimony from individuals within his inner circle, providing further details about his alleged abuse and control. Dawn Richard, a former member of Danity Kane, testified to witnessing Combs physically assault Casandra "Cassie" Ventura, while Ventura's former friend, Kerry Morgan, recounted instances of abuse she personally observed. Combs' former assistant, David James, described the demanding atmosphere of working for the rap mogul, hinting at an enterprise that facilitated his activities. Prosecutors released evidence from Ventura's testimony, including photos of injuries and a knife she used for protection, as the trial aims to prove sex trafficking and racketeering charges against Combs, who denies the allegations.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, the new president of the Kennedy Center, has alleged financial mismanagement and "phantom revenue" under the previous leadership, promising to refer the matter to federal prosecutors. The article also notes that the upcoming season will feature a mix of union and nonunion Broadway shows, a departure from the center's previous practice, which Grenell claims will provide more diverse options for audiences. Artists have expressed mixed feelings about performing at the Kennedy Center following the controversial ousting of its former bipartisan board by President Trump.

          <p>Two members of the "Puro Tango Blast" gang in South Texas received sentences for their involvement in human smuggling operations that included high-speed chases and reckless endangerment. Juan Miguel Regalado received 66 months, while Samuel Grajeda Jr. received 30 months plus an additional six months for violating supervised release. The investigation began when Regalado led law enforcement on a high-speed chase, crashing into the Rio Grande and escaping to Mexico, and continued after another group of illegal aliens entered a vehicle in the area, leading to another chase involving both Regalado and Grajeda. Authorities emphasize their commitment to dismantling violent criminal organizations involved in human smuggling.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization efforts. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to investigate the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. This initiative seeks to mitigate climate change by leveraging the high CO2 absorption capacity of marine vegetation, especially in light of declining absorption capacity of forests due to aging trees. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute reveals that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a prison in El Salvador had legally entered the U.S. The report analyzed immigration data for a portion of the men deported to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), contradicting the administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported. The analysis found that these men had been admitted after presenting themselves at a port of entry, granted parole, resettled as refugees, or entered on tourist visas. The Trump administration controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport over 200 alleged gang members to the Cecot mega-prison in March.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, signaling a move to stimulate the country's economy. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%, influenced by a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions. This decision follows state-backed commercial lenders' moves to reduce deposit rates, paving the way for lower lending rates and is part of a broader package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing earlier this month. Analysts expect further policy easing throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Netflix has secured a deal to bring Sesame Street to its streaming platform, providing its 300 million subscribers access to the 56th season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes. The deal comes after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with the program, securing the future of the show after it faced an uncertain future. PBS will retain access to the episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. The move reflects Netflix's increasing focus on children's content, with plans to add new episodes of Peppa Pig and a mobile game to the platform.</p>

Trump implied that the lack of earlier disclosure was part of a pattern of the Biden White House covering up the former president's decline. He also conflated Biden's Gleason score with the stage of his cancer and claimed that screening for prostate cancer is "standard" in physical exams, although this is not a universal recommendation.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are experiencing severe bleaching due to warming ocean temperatures, a phenomenon witnessed globally. Marine scientist Greg Asner reports that 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, leading to the expulsion of algae that give corals their color. The situation is particularly dire in the Caribbean and Florida, and while solutions like coral nurseries and sunscreen education exist, they require time. Without healthy reefs, marine life habitats diminish and coastlines lose natural protection from storms.</p>
