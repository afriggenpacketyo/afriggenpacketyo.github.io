          <p>Eurozone inflation eased to 2.2% in March, down from 2.3% in February.  Core inflation also decreased, and services inflation fell significantly.  This boosted market expectations for a further interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, potentially by 25 basis points.  The upcoming U.S. tariffs add uncertainty to the economic outlook.</p>
