          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have included numerous delays and cancellations, impacting over 500 flights. Governor Phil Murphy has described the situation as unacceptable. Schumer attributes the issues to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds. The investigation aims to address these issues and prevent future disruptions at Newark and other airports nationwide, with United Airlines already cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily due to the chaos.</p>

          <p>The City Parks Foundation has canceled R&B singer Kehlani's scheduled Central Park performance, citing security concerns raised by Mayor Eric Adams' administration, after Cornell University dropped a plan to have her headline a concert.

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's associate commissioner for inspections and investigations, has abruptly retired after more than three decades with the agency, citing frustration with the FDA's new commissioner and sweeping cuts to the inspections office. These cuts come as Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary plans to expand foreign surprise inspections, despite the agency struggling with staffing shortages. Makary also announced plans to shorten foreign inspection trips, a move that multiple officials believe will negatively impact oversight. Officials have warned of a drain on morale due to long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators.</p>

          <p>Travelers flying in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport are experiencing major delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages and equipment malfunctions.

Runway construction is also contributing to the congestion. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day, and lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA.</p>

The proposal follows Trump's suggestion of a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S., causing confusion and concern in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. Judge Jamal Whitehead dismissed the government's interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling, stating that the administration must continue processing refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The ruling emphasizes the due process rights of refugees who relied on promises made by the federal government. The Justice Department had argued it should only have to process 160 refugees.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz prison has been met with skepticism from tourists and officials alike. The idea, announced on social media, calls for a "substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ" to house America's most violent offenders. Tourists visiting the island, now a national park site, questioned the practicality and cost-effectiveness of the plan. California officials responded with ridicule and concern, while the Bureau of Prisons said it would assess the proposal.</p>

          <p>Ford and Mattel have issued warnings about the financial implications of President Trump's tariffs. Mattel anticipates raising prices on some toys in the US and decreasing its production in China for the American market. Ford estimates the tariffs will cost the company approximately $1.5 billion this year. These warnings join a growing chorus of businesses expressing concerns about the impact of US tariffs on their operations and the broader economy. Trump's administration has imposed new import taxes of up to 145% on goods from China.</p>

          <p>A declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's activities in the United States. The release of the memo contradicts the administration's portrayal of the gang as a dire threat and raises questions about the use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>
