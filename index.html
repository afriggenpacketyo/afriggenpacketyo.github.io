          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), a dominant cloud infrastructure provider, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally. The issue, which originated from AWS's main US-East-1 region, was identified as a DNS problem with its DynamoDB database service. While AWS reported signs of recovery after several hours, the event highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and even Amazon's own internal operations. The incident underscores the fragility of centralized digital infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States intends to fast-track the delivery of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the AUKUS security pact, a move aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. President Trump confirmed the plan to expedite the sale of up to five Virginia-class submarines, which could arrive as soon as 2032. However, Trump also expressed confidence in his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, suggesting the trilateral agreement might not ultimately be necessary to deter China, citing the overwhelming strength of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, repurposing them to challenge historical narratives. The collection includes a melted-down bronze statue of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied monument of Lee and Stonewall Jackson, displayed alongside contemporary art pieces. Curators and activists involved state the goal is to confront the white supremacist ideology of the 'Lost Cause' that these statues represent. The exhibit opens amid a national debate over historical revisionism, highlighted by President Trump's recent order to reinstall similar monuments.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has stated that resources will be made available to ensure Maccabi Tel Aviv fans can safely attend a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. This follows a controversial decision by the city's Safety Advisory Group to bar away fans due to safety concerns, citing previous violent incidents and rising antisemitism. Nandy called the initial ban "wrong" and confirmed that ministers are working to fund the necessary policing operation. The decision has sparked debate, with some praising the government's stance against discrimination and others warning against ignoring safety advice.</p>

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the U.S. agency responsible for the country's nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees as the government shutdown continues into its 20th day. This is the first time the NNSA has had to furlough workers since its establishment in 2000, leaving fewer than 400 employees on duty. While officials assure that the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, the furloughs are expected to impede efforts to modernize older weapons. The shutdown persists due to a congressional impasse over funding, particularly related to healthcare provisions.</p>

Zelensky described his meeting with Trump as "frank," emphasizing his goal is a just peace, not a quick one.

Unsettled debts remain fully owed, and interest and late fees continue to accumulate, potentially making the balances larger than when the program began. Additionally, a person's credit score, already impacted by the process, may worsen, and creditors can resume aggressive collection activities, including lawsuits. The article advises that while difficult, sticking with a structured debt relief plan is often more beneficial than the alternatives in the current high-interest economic climate.

          <p>A seventh victim has died from injuries sustained during a mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi, that occurred on October 10. The victim was identified as 25-year-old Ebanee Williams, who passed away at a medical center a week after the incident. The shooting, which took place downtown after a high school homecoming game, left a total of 16 people shot.

          <p>Despite a recent drop from its peak, Chicago's homicide rate remains significantly higher than that of New York or Los Angeles, fueling a polarized political debate. While President Trump has deployed National Guard troops and described the city as a "killing field," Democratic leaders argue crime has decreased and criticize the focus on Chicago. The article explores the deep-seated issues contributing to the violence, including historical disinvestment, police ineffectiveness, and gang fragmentation. It highlights the story of slain officer Aréanah Preston as a symbol of the city's ongoing struggle with violent crime.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza, brokered by the Trump administration, was tested by weekend clashes but appeared to be holding as of Monday. U.S. senior envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to help stabilize the agreement. The violence erupted after an attack killed two Israeli soldiers, prompting retaliatory Israeli airstrikes that killed 45 people in Gaza, according to local officials. Both sides accused each other of violations but have since recommitted to the peace process, which includes hostage releases and humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated that the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week." Speaking amid the third week of the funding lapse, Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats may soon vote to reopen the government, after which policy negotiations could resume. He warned, however, that if an agreement is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to cooperate. The shutdown stems from a partisan dispute over federal funding priorities, particularly Democrats' demands for additional healthcare spending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally depreciate faster than their gasoline-powered counterparts, losing about 13% more value over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this include historically heavy government and manufacturer incentives, which lower resale values, and the rapid pace of technological advancements in battery range and features. As the used EV market grows and more affordable models become available, this trend could change. However, for now, the higher depreciation remains a significant consideration for value-oriented buyers, particularly in the used car market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Qualifying for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not guaranteed and primarily depends on a federally mandated means test. This test compares a filer's household income to their state's median income; those below the median generally qualify automatically. Individuals with higher incomes may still be approved if, after deducting allowed expenses, they have little disposable income left to repay creditors. The article notes that other factors, such as recent bankruptcy filings or attempts to hide assets, can also lead to denial, making the process challenging for some. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked manager Ange Postecoglou after a brief and unsuccessful 40-day tenure, culminating in a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea. The appointment was widely seen as a mismatch from the start, as Postecoglou's high-pressing, attacking style of football was fundamentally unsuited to the team's counter-attacking squad. His short reign yielded just six points from his last 18 league games across his time at Forest and his previous club, Tottenham. The swift dismissal ends a perplexing chapter for both the club and the manager, whose reputation has been significantly damaged.</p>
