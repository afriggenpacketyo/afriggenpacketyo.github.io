          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in a challenging four-set encounter at the US Open, advancing to the fourth round with a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 score. The 38-year-old Serb, who struggled with a lower back injury during the match, made history as the oldest man to reach the tournament's last 16 since 1991, tying Roger Federer for most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances. Despite his physical struggles and recent absence from the tour, Djokovic's dominant serving, including 18 aces, proved crucial. This hard-fought victory boosts his confidence as he aims for a record 25th major title.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a lackluster 3-0 shutout loss against the Arizona Diamondbacks, managing only three hits and failing to capitalize on scoring opportunities. This unexpected defeat halted their recent four-game winning streak, occurring during a period where they were expected to secure easy wins against weaker teams. Starting pitcher Blake Snell struggled with reduced fastball velocity, conceding three runs, including a crucial two-run home run. Manager Dave Roberts criticized the team's offensive performance, underscoring a missed chance to extend their division lead. The game served as a reminder that beating underperforming opponents is not always straightforward.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C., Jia Cobb, has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained within the United States. This ruling is a significant setback for the administration's goal of rapidly deporting migrants without judicial review, a key promise of President Trump's 2024 campaign. Judge Cobb suggested that the expanded policy infringes upon individuals' due process rights, asserting that even those who entered illegally are entitled to Fifth Amendment protections. The decision mandates due process for those subjected to expedited removal, particularly for a large group previously unaffected by the fast-track process.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks suffered a critical 76-75 loss to the Indiana Fever at Crypto.com Arena, a defeat that severely impacts their pursuit of a playoff berth. The Sparks started strong, maintaining a lead through the first half, but the Fever, spearheaded by Aliyah Boston and former Spark Odyssey Sims, mounted a comeback in the second half. In the game's final seconds, a crucial offensive rebound by Boston led to Sims' go-ahead score, followed by a decisive turnover from Kelsey Plum, sealing the Sparks' fate. The team now sits in ninth place, two games out of the final playoff spot with only seven games left.</p>

He reported facing retaliation, including exclusion and a hostile work environment, after raising internal concerns. This situation unfolds after the Supreme Court temporarily permitted DOGE access to sensitive SSA data, despite earlier lower court injunctions driven by privacy concerns from labor unions.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab has revealed the construction of an extensive 31km earthen barrier, or "berm," around the besieged Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This wall, built since May, is interpreted as an effort to trap civilians, intensifying the siege conditions and restricting access to the city, which serves as the last major foothold for the army in Darfur. The Sudan Doctors Network reports that the RSF is escalating its offensive, deliberately targeting civilians, with recent shellings causing 24 deaths and 55 injuries, alongside an attack on a prominent hospital.</p>

          <p>Chinese equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, attracting substantial interest from both domestic retail and global investors seeking more attractive investment opportunities. Analysts, including Jian Shi Cortesi from GAM Investments, project a sustained upward trend, driven by Chinese investors reallocating capital from low-yielding fixed-income products and the government's strategic push for technological innovation. Cortesi specifically points to "undervalued innovation" within sectors such as advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence. This renewed optimism follows two consecutive months of foreign capital inflows and the Shanghai Composite Index reaching a 10-year peak, indicating a potential turnaround from years of market underperformance.

          <p>Live-fire military training has caused hundreds of wildfires across the UK countryside since 2023, with 385 out of 439 fires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land attributed to army maneuvers. These fires are often difficult to tackle due to the presence of unexploded shells from past training, including Second World War ordnance, which can explode. Locals express concerns about the smoke's environmental and health impacts, advocating for restrictions on live-fire training during dry months. The MoD asserts it has robust wildfire policies and uses firebreaks, but critics argue more needs to be done to clear old munitions and prevent new blazes.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's efforts to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans residing and working in the United States. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, concluding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the statutory authority to revoke a previous TPS extension. The court underscored Congress's intent for the TPS program to be predictable and shielded from political influence, providing beneficiaries with essential stability. This ruling represents a substantial legal victory for plaintiffs challenging the administration's immigration policies, although the precise impact on Venezuelans whose protections have already lapsed is yet to be fully determined.</p>

The trial saw moments of levity, including the lawyer's confusion over her wigs and fake nails, which some social media users deemed potentially racist or misogynistic.

Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported Trump administration plan to deploy military forces to Chicago, characterizing it as an "invasion" and questioning the President's true intentions beyond addressing crime.

He asserted that sending troops would constitute "an attack on the American people" and an attempt to manipulate future elections. The White House, however, dismissed Pritzker's accusations, criticizing him for allegedly deflecting from Chicago's significant crime issues.</p>

Opposing forces, including former Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and a diverse coalition, have already committed over $10 million to airtime, with proponents also actively securing significant ad placements.

          <p>President Donald Trump has unilaterally cut $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding across 15 international programs, utilizing a rarely employed "pocket rescission" procedure. This tactic allows the administration to bypass direct congressional approval by submitting a request to withhold funds so close to the fiscal year's end that the money expires before a mandatory 45-day voting period. Declaring the move "AMERICA FIRST!", the action has provoked strong condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and even some moderate Republicans, who argue it is illegal and raises the specter of a federal government shutdown.

          <p>A comprehensive re-examination of decades-old files by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and prosecutors has concluded that Sheriff Buford Pusser, the real-life inspiration for the "Walking Tall" films, likely murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. Authorities now assert that Pusser fabricated the narrative of his wife being killed by his enemies, as new evidence contradicts his initial statements. Medical examiners determined Pauline was probably shot outside the vehicle and subsequently placed inside, while Pusser's own cheek wound was deemed a close-contact, potentially self-inflicted injury. The investigation also revealed indications of domestic violence, offering long-awaited closure to Pauline's family and dismantling a widely accepted legend.</p>

Clinical guidelines recommend starting with behavioral therapy due to potential side effects like irritability and aggression, and a high likelihood of treatment failure with early medication.
