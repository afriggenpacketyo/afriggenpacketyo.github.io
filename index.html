          <p>Joseph Neumeyer, a dual U.S.-German citizen, has been charged with attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv. According to federal prosecutors, Neumeyer approached the embassy on May 19 with Molotov cocktails but was stopped by a guard, leading to his arrest at a nearby hotel. The incident occurred amid the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, and Neumeyer had reportedly made threatening social media posts prior to the attack. Israeli officials deported Neumeyer to New York, where he faced a federal judge in Brooklyn.</p>

The price reductions, some as steep as 34%, are aimed at boosting sales amid increasing competition in the EV sector.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to reduce soaring prices, aiming to bring them down to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi established a special response team to address high rice prices and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products. The government intends to release about 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system to exert more influence over prices. A recent poll indicates that nearly 60% of respondents believe Koizumi can effectively lower rice prices.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. The film, released in 1969, debunked the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation in World War II, interviewing citizens of Clermont-Ferrand who either collaborated with the Nazis or turned a blind eye to atrocities. Although controversial, the film became his masterpiece, paving the way for revisionist accounts of wartime France. Ophuls also directed "HÃ´tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which won an Oscar in 1988.</p>

While public opinion and protests have increased, governments with leverage over Israel have refused to act, rendering the change in language largely symbolic.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep allows the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, discovered that hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚) acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. This breakthrough solves a long-standing mystery of why sleep is biologically essential and opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, resulted in the deaths of at least seven children from the same family, with two more missing and presumed dead. The strike hit a building near the family's home, causing a fire that quickly spread, resulting in the deaths of the children. The Israeli military stated that it had struck suspects in the area but was checking if uninvolved civilians were harmed.</p>
