          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit, significantly surpassing market expectations. This growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 57% of its revenue. In response to this strong performance and continued demand, TSMC has raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy experienced a slight expansion of 0.1% in August, following a 0.1% contraction in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. This marginal growth comes as the government faces increasing pressure to stimulate the economy ahead of the upcoming Budget. Economists and institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies have warned that tax increases or spending cuts may be necessary to meet borrowing rules. The ONS noted that over a three-month period, the economy grew by 0.3%, indicating some underlying stability. (not investment advice)</p>

Key contributions came from Andrés Giménez, George Springer, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Alejandro Kirk, and Addison Barger, who all hit home runs.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, though no specific timeline was provided. The move is part of Washington's effort to isolate Moscow financially over its war in Ukraine and pressure China to take similar action. India's external affairs ministry responded by stating its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy security. India has been a major buyer of Russian crude, and this development marks a significant point of discussion in US-India relations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly confirmed that he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the U.S. This unusual acknowledgment of a secret intelligence operation comes after recent deadly U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean originating from Venezuela. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who condemned it as an act of war, and raised concerns in the U.S. Congress about a potential conflict without proper oversight.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump Administration from Firing Federal Workers Amid Shutdown</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with the termination of more than 4,000 federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two major unions representing federal employees. The judge cited President Trump's own statements suggesting the layoffs were politically motivated to target specific agencies, calling the firings during a shutdown "unprecedented" and likely contrary to law. A hearing for a more permanent injunction is scheduled for later this month.</p>

          <p>Lawyers representing 150 victims of the Jesus Army cult have condemned a plan to distribute the group's estimated £50 million fortune, calling it "shameful." A BBC investigation revealed that 172 former loyal members, including some accused of perpetrating or covering up child abuse, are set to receive significantly larger payouts than victims compensated through a redress scheme. This financial arrangement means only a small fraction of the disgraced sect's total assets will go to those who suffered sexual, physical, and emotional abuse within the community.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation into jury duty compliance in California has found that approximately one in four summoned residents fails to appear. The consequences for dodging this civic duty vary dramatically across the state's 58 counties, with many courts admitting they do not sanction no-shows at all, despite official warnings of fines and jail time. This lack of enforcement raises concerns among legal experts about the ability to assemble a jury of one's peers and could potentially undermine the fairness of trials.</p>
