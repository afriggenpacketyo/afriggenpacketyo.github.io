          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a long-time Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1st, as the company grapples with declining EV sales and profits. Hartung, known for his disciplined financial approach at Chipotle during the COVID-19 pandemic, will also join Tesla's audit committee, expanding the board to nine members. This appointment comes at a time when concerns are rising about CEO Elon Musk's focus, particularly with his role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Hartung's son-in-law is a service technician for Tesla, and he also serves on the boards of Portillo's, The Honest Company, and ZocDoc.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is reportedly not planning to prosecute Boeing in a case tied to the two crashes of the aerospace giant's 737 Max, a tentative agreement that would allow the plane-maker to avoid a guilty plea. Boeing had initially agreed to plead guilty in the case last summer after the Biden administration found that the company violated a 2021 agreement tied to the crashes. However, a judge rejected that plea deal last year, citing concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and opened the possibility that Boeing could face trial.</p>

          <p>A humanities federation and a state council have filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and the National Endowment for the Humanities, seeking to reverse local funding cuts. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Portland, Oregon, argues that DOGE and the NEH exceeded their authority in terminating funding mandated by Congress. DOGE shut down the funding and laid off more than 80% of the staff at the NEH in April as part of an executive order by President Trump, targeting cultural establishments in an effort to downsize the federal government and end initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While it's legally possible to stop paying credit cards, doing so can lead to serious financial consequences, including damaged credit, collection activity, and potential lawsuits. Credit card debt is unsecured, meaning there's no collateral for lenders to seize, but creditors can pursue legal avenues to recover unpaid balances. Before halting payments, consider alternatives like hardship programs offered by card issuers, credit counseling, or debt settlement, and bankruptcy should be considered a last resort. Exploring these options can help manage debt without risking wage garnishment or long-term financial fallout.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has fallen to near-record lows, driven by increasing worries that tariffs will lead to higher inflation, according to a University of Michigan survey. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8 in May, the second-lowest reading on record, while year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%. The survey indicated that tariffs were a major factor in consumer sentiment, with nearly three-quarters of consumers spontaneously mentioning them. Economists largely agree that tariffs could cause a short-term rise in prices, but the extent and long-term impact remain uncertain.</p>

Consumers are also advised to check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has been found to have lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S. Cooking rice like pasta, using more water and draining the excess, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that Iran is interested in trading with the United States and expressed openness to the idea, emphasizing his use of trade "to settle scores and to make peace." Trump also conveyed a sense of urgency in nuclear negotiations with Iran, stating that there is not much time left before Iran potentially obtains a nuclear weapon. The United States has imposed various sanctions on Iran, and trade is still significantly restricted.</p>

          <p>A new assessment from the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that the Republican tax plan may offer only modest gains to everyday workers, and some taxpayers may actually be left in worse financial shape if the bill becomes law. The analysis found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026, while the top 0.1 percent would gain significantly. The plan's combination of tax cuts and federal spending cuts could disproportionately affect the poorest Americans.</p>

Epic Games said that Apple's decision means Fortnite will be offline worldwide on iOS until Apple unblocks it. Apple stated it asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies. The resubmission followed a court ruling that the iPhone maker was not allowed to charge a commission on purchases made outside of an iOS app.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk will replace its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, citing a sharp decline in its stock price that stemmed from increased competition for its popular weight-loss drug, according to the New York Times article. The company's stock has fallen by 50 percent in the past year as it has faced increasingly fierce competition from lower-cost copycat versions and Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound. Investors have soured on the company, despite its initial success with Ozempic and Wegovy, as it struggles to maintain market share in the rapidly evolving weight-loss drug landscape.</p>
