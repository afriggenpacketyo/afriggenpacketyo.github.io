          <p>Disney is raising prices for its streaming packages, including Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundles, effective October 21. The ad-supported Disney+ plan will increase to $11.99 monthly, while the premium ad-free option will rise to $18.99. This move follows a similar price hike in October 2024 and comes as the company faces public scrutiny over its handling of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host's controversial comments. Disney anticipates a modest increase in subscribers despite the price adjustments and recent backlash.</p>

          <p>Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, is facing questions about her personal finances after a clip from a May interview resurfaced. In the video, she appeared to evade questions about earning $7 million in stock trades since taking office. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, has accused her of profiting from public service, citing reports that her family's net worth has significantly increased. Sherrill has defended herself by stating that she does not trade individual stocks and that the wealth comes from her husband's compensation, which is automatically sold.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's warnings against using acetaminophen during pregnancy, this article examines the scientific evidence regarding its potential link to autism. While some studies have suggested an association, larger and more controlled research, including a major Swedish study analyzing siblings, found no causal link, attributing the correlation to other factors like genetics or infections. Medical groups emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose known risks to both mother and child, making acetaminophen one of the few safe options available. Experts advise parents to consult their physicians rather than making decisions based on political statements or inconclusive research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for home equity loans have slightly decreased, making them a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $40,000 loan, a 10-year term now costs approximately $494 per month, while a 15-year term is around $389, both lower than costs earlier in the year. The article contrasts these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer slightly lower initial payments but carry the risk of future rate increases. Homeowners are advised to weigh the benefits of current rates against the possibility of further cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has canceled a scheduled meeting with top congressional Democrats, raising the likelihood of a federal government shutdown by the September 30 deadline. The talks were intended to negotiate a funding deal, but Democrats are insisting that any agreement include extensions for Affordable Care Act tax credits. Trump criticized their demands as "unserious and ridiculous," stating no meeting could be productive under the circumstances.

          <p>At the United Nations General Assembly, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva delivered a speech criticizing Washington's trade tariffs and military actions while advocating for closer ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an olive branch moments later, proposing a meeting for the following week. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter after the speech. The exchange marks a surprising diplomatic opening amid ongoing tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's winger Noni Madueke is expected to be out of action for six to eight weeks due to a knee injury he sustained during a match against Manchester City. The club has confirmed that the injury is not to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which is a positive sign for his long-term recovery. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed hope for a relatively swift return but noted that further scans are needed to determine the full extent of the damage. The injury is a significant setback for both Arsenal and the England national team, ruling Madueke out of several key upcoming domestic and international fixtures.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the threats made by FCC Chair Brendan Carr against Disney and its affiliates over Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments, suggesting they are unlikely to result in revoked broadcast licenses. Historically, the FCC has rarely taken such drastic action based on programming content due to First Amendment protections, with only three stations ever losing a license for what they aired. The author argues that Carr's real leverage is not license revocation but his control over regulatory approvals for major media mergers, which could influence companies like Nexstar and Sinclair to preempt the show to stay in his good graces. This dynamic pressures networks through business incentives rather than direct legal penalties.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has convicted Ryan Routh on all five counts, including attempted assassination, for his plot against Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024. After the verdict was read, Routh attempted to harm himself with a pen before being subdued by U.S. Marshals, causing an outburst in the courtroom. Representing himself, Routh argued that while he planned the attack, he never intended to pull the trigger and lacked the capacity to kill. Prosecutors successfully countered that he took substantial steps to carry out the plot, which constituted the crime of attempt. Routh faces a sentence of up to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball's competition committee has approved the implementation of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, commonly known as "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes on the field. Each team will receive two challenges per game, which they can use to have a call reviewed by the Hawk-Eye camera technology, with the result displayed on stadium videoboards. The move aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce ejections, as over 60% of them in recent seasons were related to disputes over ball and strike calls.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "Medigap birthday rule," a state-specific provision that allows Medicare beneficiaries an annual window to switch their supplemental insurance plans without medical underwriting. Typically, after the initial open enrollment period, seniors with pre-existing conditions can be denied new coverage or charged higher premiums. In the roughly 18 states with a birthday rule, individuals can switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits around their birthday each year, regardless of their health status. This rule provides financial flexibility and allows seniors to find more affordable or suitable coverage as their needs and the market change.</p>

          <p>With recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A $60,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment period now has an approximate monthly payment of $730, based on current average rates. The article highlights that HELOCs have a variable interest rate, which is advantageous in a declining rate environment as payments can decrease without refinancing. This flexibility, combined with the fact that borrowers only pay interest on the amount they use, makes HELOCs an attractive option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is advocating for buying Boeing stock, citing reports that the U.S. and China are finalizing a massive aircraft order as part of broader trade negotiations. This potential deal aligns with Cramer's long-held view that countries seeking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. would purchase Boeing planes. The stock has already seen gains following this news and other recent deals with countries like Turkey and Uzbekistan. Cramer's investment thesis is that President Trump's trade agenda has been highly beneficial for Boeing, leading to significant international orders and positioning the company for growth.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has strongly defended the central bank's independence against political pressure, particularly from the Trump administration. Without naming President Trump, Powell dismissed accusations that the Fed's decisions are politically motivated as a "cheap shot." His comments come amid an ongoing campaign by the White House to influence the Fed's policies, including public demands for lower interest rates and efforts to reshape its board of governors. Powell reiterated that the Fed's actions are driven by economic data as it navigates the challenge of rising inflation and a weakening labor market.</p>

This marks the first time students have been helped to leave the war-torn region for educational purposes in the UK since the conflict began. The students, including recipients of the prestigious Chevening Scholarship, traveled via Jordan to complete visa checks. While celebrating the students' safe arrival, advocates noted that nearly 40 more eligible students are awaiting evacuation and criticized UK rules that prevent students from bringing family members with them.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from CDC scientists, U.S. infection rates from highly drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" increased by nearly 70% between 2019 and 2023. The surge is primarily driven by bacteria carrying the NDM gene, which makes them resistant to most antibiotics, including last-resort carbapenems. These infections were once rare and linked to overseas medical care, but their prevalence is growing, raising concerns about community spread. Researchers suggest the increase may be linked to a surge in antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic, and warn that common infections could become much harder to treat.</p>
