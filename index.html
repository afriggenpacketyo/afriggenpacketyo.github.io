          <h2>Trump Administration's Pharmaceutical Tariff Threat Weakens After Pfizer Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 12:34:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals appears less threatening to drugmakers following a new deal with Pfizer. The agreement grants Pfizer a three-year exemption from such tariffs in exchange for voluntary price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and research. This development has reassured the industry, suggesting a repeatable model for other major pharmaceutical companies to avoid levies by negotiating similar pacts. The deal led to a significant rally in pharmaceutical stocks, as it provides a clearer path forward and shifts the administration's focus from punitive tariffs to negotiated pricing agreements.</p>

          <p>Veteran investor Leon Cooperman has expressed concern that the stock market has entered a risky, late stage of its bull run, referencing a similar warning made by Warren Buffett in 1999. Cooperman noted that current market behavior, characterized by widespread participation and irrational exuberance, mirrors the conditions Buffett described as preceding a downturn. He pointed to the 'ridiculously high' valuations of AI companies and the Buffett Indicator being at record levels as clear signs of market froth. Despite these risks, Cooperman stated that stocks remain a less risky investment than government bonds due to the erosive effects of elevated inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to continue serving on the central bank's board until at least 2026, pending a full hearing in January. The court denied the Trump administration's request to remove her immediately over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This decision is a departure from previous cases involving the president's removal power over officials at independent agencies. The case stems from President Trump's attempt to fire Cook "for cause," a presidential power that has never before been used against a Fed board member in the institution's 112-year history.</p>

Cramer also commented on the rally in pharmaceutical stocks like Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly, following Pfizer's deal with the White House, though he remains cautious on buying more Bristol Myers shares.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 12:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former President Joseph Kabila to death in absentia for treason and war crimes, including backing the M23 rebel group. The verdict has amplified concerns about the nation's stability, with Kabila's supporters claiming the trial was politically motivated and could derail fragile peace efforts in the conflict-ridden eastern provinces. While some activists support the ruling, citing the need for accountability for years of violence, political analysts express skepticism that the sentence will ever be enforced. The judgment marks a climax in the long-standing rivalry between Kabila and current President Felix Tshisekedi.</p>

          <p>An explosion, believed to have originated in the boiler room, caused a significant partial collapse of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx on Wednesday morning. The blast sent a cascade of debris, including bricks and air conditioning units, onto the street below, destroying an entire corner of the structure. Despite the extensive damage, officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, expressed immense relief as no injuries or fatalities were reported among the building's residents. First responders are currently conducting inspections to ensure the building's structural integrity while the Red Cross has established a support center for affected families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the first day of the U.S. government shutdown, the Senate once again failed to advance legislation to fund federal agencies. Lawmakers held procedural votes on both a Democratic proposal and a House-passed Republican stop-gap bill, with both measures failing to secure the necessary support to overcome the filibuster. Congressional leaders from both parties continued to blame each other for the impasse, with Republicans urging a handful of Democrats to support their 'clean' funding bill. Meanwhile, Democrats insisted on negotiating their priorities, including healthcare provisions, into any funding agreement, leaving no clear path to reopening the government.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a funding extension before the October 1 deadline, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers. The impasse stems from a fundamental disagreement between Republicans, who passed a 'clean' short-term funding bill in the House, and Democrats, who are demanding that negotiations include an extension of health insurance subsidies set to expire. Because most legislation requires a 60-vote majority in the Senate, Democratic support is necessary, but neither side has been willing to concede. This has resulted in the suspension of non-essential government services until a new spending agreement can be reached.</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximately 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush purchases to take advantage of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit that expired in September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's saw a 30% increase, helping GM maintain its position as the top U.S. automaker by market share. Industry analysts expect overall EV sales for the quarter to set a new record, though some automakers anticipate a temporary slowdown in October now that the incentive program has ended.</p>

          <p>A makeshift scaffolding structure collapsed at a church in Arerti, Ethiopia, resulting in the deaths of at least 36 people and injuring over 200 others. The tragic incident occurred on Wednesday morning as a large group had gathered for an annual religious festival celebrating the Virgin Mary. Local officials reported that the death toll could rise as some individuals remained trapped under the debris of the collapsed wooden poles. The event has drawn attention to the lack of health and safety regulations in the nation, where construction accidents are unfortunately common. The government has expressed condolences and emphasized that safety must be prioritized.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly in the final stages of a deal to purchase Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical division, OxyChem, for approximately $10 billion. If completed, this would be Berkshire's largest acquisition since its 2022 purchase of insurer Alleghany. The move comes as Berkshire sits on a record cash pile of $344 billion and prepares for Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, who has extensive experience in the energy sector. Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, having previously helped finance its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Private flood insurer Neptune Insurance Holdings began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with its IPO timing coinciding with the U.S. government shutdown. The shutdown has suspended the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), preventing it from accepting new applications or processing claims, which could delay real estate closings. Neptune's CEO highlighted that his company remains open for business, offering an alternative for homeowners who require flood insurance for their mortgages. The company, which uses AI to assess risk, is part of a growing trend of properties seeking coverage from private carriers rather than the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bankrupt low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is significantly reducing its operations as it undergoes restructuring, announcing plans to end service to eleven cities in the western and southern U.S. on October 2. The airline is also grounding planes, furloughing approximately 1,800 flight attendants, and seeking pay cuts from pilots in an effort to return to profitability. Industry analysts warn that Spirit's withdrawal from these routes could lead to higher fares for consumers unless other budget airlines step in to fill the void. The cuts are part of a broader strategy to align staffing and flight volume with its reduced fleet size.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the apparent contradiction of conservative women, such as Erika Kirk, who has become CEO of Turning Point USA after her husband's death, publicly advocating for traditional gender roles where women prioritize the home. It draws parallels to historical figures like Phyllis Schlafly, who built a powerful political career while championing the role of the stay-at-home wife. Experts suggest that for followers of this ideology, a woman taking on a public career is not seen as hypocritical if it is in service of her husband's legacy or to promote traditional values. The piece notes this dynamic often overlooks the economic realities facing most families.</p>

          <p>Russia significantly increased its crude oil exports through its western ports by 25% in September compared to the previous month, reaching 2.5 million barrels per day. This surge is a direct consequence of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian oil refineries, which have disrupted domestic fuel production and freed up more crude oil for export. The increased exports allow Russia to maintain its crude oil production levels despite the damage to its refining capacity. The attacks have caused domestic fuel shortages, prompting Russian authorities to plan curbs on gasoline and diesel exports while redirecting unrefined crude to international markets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to affect California, although essential services like airport operations, mail delivery, and Social Security payments will continue. However, the state will see disruptions in other areas, including the closure of VA call centers and benefit regional offices. The shutdown will also furlough nearly 90% of EPA staff, halting pollution enforcement, research, and permitting activities, which could delay environmental projects. While student loan disbursements will continue, some federal education grants for local schools and civil rights investigations are expected to be paused for the duration of the funding lapse.</p>

The brand's success is attributed to its immense popularity on social media platforms and a growing trend of adults purchasing the toys for themselves.

          <p>The attorneys general of New York, Arizona, Connecticut, Washington, and Virginia have filed a lawsuit against Zillow and Redfin, accusing the companies of conspiring to eliminate competition in the online apartment rental market. The suit, which follows a similar action by the FTC, centers on a deal where Zillow allegedly paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its competing rental advertising business and transfer clients. Officials argue this agreement insulates Zillow from competition, potentially driving up advertising costs and reducing options for renters. The states are seeking an injunction to block the partnership and may request a restructuring of the businesses.</p>

          <p>At the request of his widow, Colorado officials are conducting a case review of the 2005 death of renowned journalist Hunter S. Thompson, which was originally ruled a suicide. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation stated that the review is not based on new evidence but is intended to provide a fresh, transparent look at the original investigation. Thompson, famous for his 'gonzo' journalism style and the novel "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home at the age of 67. The local sheriff said the review aims to offer peace of mind to his family and the public.</p>

          <p>Afghans are celebrating the restoration of internet and telecommunication services after a 48-hour nationwide blackout ordered by the Taliban government. The shutdown had provoked widespread international condemnation, disrupting businesses, flights, and access to emergency services. For many Afghan women and girls, who have been barred from education and most jobs, the internet serves as a crucial lifeline to the outside world. While the Taliban has not provided an official reason for the blackout, a provincial official had previously suggested it was to prevent 'vices,' aligning with the regime's strict interpretation of Islamic law.</p>
