          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of the late tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his former business partner are liable for £700 million owed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's company, Autonomy, with the court finding that its finances were misrepresented, causing HPE to overpay. This decision concludes a significant part of a long and complex legal battle, though the final amount of damages is still to be determined in a future hearing.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced that auto tariffs impacted its second-quarter results by $1.1 billion, though its overall earnings still surpassed Wall Street estimates. The company affirmed its full-year guidance, which includes a potential $4 billion to $5 billion total impact from the levies, but stated it is actively working to mitigate these costs. CEO Mary Barra emphasized that GM is adapting to new trade policies by adjusting manufacturing and implementing cost initiatives to reduce its exposure to the ongoing financial pressures from the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new study from Harvard University researchers suggests that the sex of children in a family may not be a simple 50/50 probability. Analyzing over 58,000 women's birthing records, the study found that after having two children of the same sex, the likelihood of subsequent children being the same sex increases, indicating a potential biological predisposition within families. While the exact mechanism is unknown, researchers noted factors like maternal age at first birth could play a role, though they acknowledge the need for more data, including paternal factors.</p>

          <p>Shares of companies like Opendoor Technologies and Kohl's have experienced massive, volatile surges, reminiscent of the 2021 meme stock phenomenon. Fueled by chatter on online forums like WallStreetBets, retail traders have piled into these heavily shorted stocks, causing their prices to skyrocket and trading volumes to explode. This activity is often driven by a desire to create a "short squeeze," where those betting against the stock are forced to buy shares to cover their losses, further amplifying the rally.

The author suggests this degradation of the online experience could have an unintended positive consequence: pushing people to log off and re-engage with the real world. As online resources become less reliable and interactions feel less human, activities like reading physical books, shopping at local stores, and in-person socializing may become more appealing alternatives to constant screen time.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF party are advocating for new measures to promote patriotism and further criminalize government criticism, building on the controversial 2023 Patriotic Act.

Critics contend that true patriotism involves holding the government accountable, not blind obedience, and that these moves shrink the country's democratic space.</p>

          <p>NPR's editor in chief and acting chief content officer, Edith Chapin, has announced she is stepping down from her role in the fall. Her decision comes just days after the U.S. Congress voted to eliminate all federal funding for public broadcasting, a move driven by President Trump. Chapin, a veteran news leader who has been with NPR since 2012, stated the choice was her own and that she had informed CEO Katherine Maher of her intent to take a break two weeks prior to the congressional vote.</p>

          <p>Police Scotland is preparing for a "large-scale, complex" security operation for Donald Trump's upcoming visit to his golf resort at Menie, where he is expected to open a new course. The operation is anticipated to be the largest in Scotland since 2022, involving local officers, national divisions, and support from other UK forces. Authorities are preparing for significant protests, similar to those during his 2018 visit, and are working with the police union to address concerns about officer staffing and pressure.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has confirmed it has imposed exit bans on two American citizens: a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office employee who was traveling personally, and a Wells Fargo banker, Mao Chenyue, who is reportedly involved in a criminal case. The incidents highlight the risks for U.S. citizens in China, as the State Department warns that Beijing can arbitrarily enforce such bans without a transparent legal process. This comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-China relations, with ongoing trade negotiations and a looming tariff deadline.</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, a former criminal defense lawyer for Donald Trump and current Justice Department official, is facing bipartisan opposition to his nomination for the U.S. Court of Appeals. While Democrats walked out of his committee vote in protest, some prominent conservative legal activists are also raising alarms. These conservatives worry that Bove's nomination prioritizes personal loyalty to the president over a proven commitment to conservative legal principles, marking a potential return to cronyism in judicial appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, a licensed psychotherapist challenges the conventional wisdom of "just be yourself," arguing it is incomplete and potentially harmful advice. The author posits that humans possess multiple, often contradictory, inner "selves," and that true emotional maturity comes from "self-leadership" rather than raw, unfiltered expression. This involves becoming aware of one's different internal parts and consciously choosing how to act in a way that aligns with personal values and considers the impact on others, leading to more thoughtful and effective interactions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the United Nations' scientific and cultural organization, for the second time. The White House cited the agency's support for "woke, divisive cultural and social causes" as the primary reason for the exit. This move reverses the Biden administration's 2023 decision to rejoin the organization, from which the U.S. had previously withdrawn in 2017 under Trump, also citing an anti-Israel bias at the time.</p>

          <p>Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, has issued a strong warning that his country will intervene directly to prevent any attempt to divide Syria.
