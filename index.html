          <p>A report from Dessau, Germany, reveals a troubling trend where right-wing extremism has become a "cool" part of youth pop culture, with glorification of Hitler and Nazi slogans becoming normalized. The article connects this phenomenon to the region's economic struggles following reunification and the broader national rise of the far-right AfD party. It also highlights the efforts of local citizens and youth groups who are actively organizing and pushing back against the spread of hatred and extremist ideologies in their community.</p>

Ryan's departure was reportedly a response to administration demands tied to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Warner warned that if such political pressure can be successfully applied to a major public university like UVA, it sets a dangerous precedent for academic institutions nationwide.</p>

          <p>According to a Washington Post report citing U.S. intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials appear to downplay the severity of the damage from recent American airstrikes on their nuclear facilities. While President Trump has claimed the program was "obliterated," this intelligence adds to questions about the true extent of the impact. A source cautioned, however, that the truthfulness of the Iranian officials in the intercepts is questionable, making them potentially unreliable indicators of the actual damage.</p>
