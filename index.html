          <p>Nicola Sturgeon's memoir, "Frankly," details the highs and lows of her tenure as Scotland's first minister, including significant personal and political challenges. The book covers her regrets over the handling of gender recognition legislation, her fractured relationship with predecessor Alex Salmond, and the intense mental health toll of leading during the pandemic. Sturgeon also provides context on her arrest during the Operation Branchform investigation into SNP finances, which she describes as the worst day of her life, and reflects on her future after politics.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old missing person case was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman whose boyfriend confessed to a fatal hit-and-run. After Alexander McKellar admitted to killing cyclist Tony Parsons and showed her the remote burial site, Dr. Caroline Muirhead secretly dropped a Red Bull can to mark the spot. She later contacted the police, whose investigation led to the recovery of Parsons' body and the conviction of McKellar, bringing a long-awaited resolution to the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has reduced its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, its lowest level since April 2023, in response to evolving economic conditions. The Reserve Bank of Australia also downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand. This move comes as inflation has substantially decreased from its 2022 peak, now sitting near the lower end of the bank's target range, and amid a shifting global trade environment.

          <p>Recent polling in Israel reveals a significant shift in public opinion, with a growing majority now supporting a deal with Hamas to secure the release of all remaining hostages, even if it requires ending the war in Gaza. This sentiment is driven by the hostages' families and growing protests against the government's handling of the conflict. However, other surveys highlight a stark contrast, indicating that most Jewish Israelis are not troubled by reports of Palestinian suffering and famine, reflecting the deeply divided perspectives within the country.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that thousands of North Koreans are being sent to work in Russia under what they describe as slave-like conditions, filling a labor shortage exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. According to escapees and South Korean intelligence, these laborers endure grueling 18-hour workdays on construction sites, with their earnings largely confiscated by the North Korean state. This practice violates UN sanctions, and Pyongyang is reportedly tightening control to prevent workers from escaping the abysmal conditions.</p>

          <p>Spain is charting a foreign policy course that is creating friction with the Trump administration by resisting U.S. pressure on several fronts. The Spanish government has renounced the purchase of American F-35 fighter jets in favor of European aircraft, resisted committing to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, and pursued closer economic ties with China. This has made Spain a rare example of a European nation willing to openly antagonize President Trump, though it has so far avoided direct consequences.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that a specific model of the NexGen knee implant, used in thousands of UK operations, was known to have a high failure rate for eight years before it was finally recalled in 2022. Patients have reported severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers after the implant slipped out of place, leading to hundreds of corrective surgeries. Surgeons state the manufacturer, Zimmer Biomet, was slow to acknowledge the problem, which is now estimated to cost the NHS millions in revision operations.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for government guidance to ensure the healthy development of the country's booming "quick commerce" sector. He warned against the current trend of excessive cash burn and zero-sum price wars among e-commerce platforms competing for the instant retail market. Instead, Wang urged policymakers to foster a more sustainable model focused on innovation, quality upgrades, and a win-win industrial ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old girl is recovering in the hospital after being attacked by a mountain lion outside her home in Malibu. The girl sustained injuries to her arm, leg, and back but is in stable condition. After the family scared the animal away, officials from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife located the mountain lion hiding in nearby brush and killed it to ensure public safety. DNA samples will be used to confirm it was the correct animal.</p>

          <p>In a bid to boost tourism in its less-developed western provinces, Nepal has announced it will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan mountains for the next two years. This initiative aims to draw mountaineers to more remote areas and generate local economic activity. The move contrasts with a recent fee increase for summiting Mount Everest, which continues to struggle with overcrowding and environmental concerns, and could position the other peaks as ideal training grounds.</p>
