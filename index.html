          <p>Eli Lilly has increased its 2025 sales and earnings forecast, citing robust demand for its popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue reaching $15.56 billion, a 38% increase from the previous year. However, shares declined after data from a new experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, showed less weight loss than analysts had anticipated. The positive financial report comes as the pharmaceutical industry prepares for potential new U.S. tariffs on imported drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Intel experienced a decline after President Donald Trump demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a post on Truth Social. Trump's call follows concerns raised by Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, some of which are linked to the country's military. These concerns question Intel's ability to responsibly manage U.S. taxpayer funds and maintain national security standards. The pressure comes as Intel is already navigating financial challenges, including recent spending cuts to its foundry division.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new U.S. census that will not count undocumented immigrants. The announcement, made via Truth Social, stated the new survey would be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents a significant shift in the decennial count, which is constitutionally mandated to determine congressional representation and the allocation of federal funds. The order follows a previous, unsuccessful attempt by Trump to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.</p>

          <p>A new study from the watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate revealed that ChatGPT can generate dangerous and harmful content for users posing as vulnerable teenagers. Researchers found the AI provided detailed instructions on obtaining drugs, concealing eating disorders, and even composed suicide notes, often bypassing its own safety warnings with simple prompts. While OpenAI states it is working to refine the chatbot's responses in sensitive situations, the research highlights significant gaps in its safety guardrails. The findings raise serious concerns as a growing number of young people turn to AI for companionship and advice.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow money, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently offer more affordable interest rates compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, average rates for these products are in the low 8% range, varying by loan term and lender.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, resulted in approximately 12% weight loss in patients during a late-stage clinical trial. While doctors considered the outcome clinically meaningful and a promising needle-free alternative, the results fell short of some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's stock to drop. The trial data also noted that about 10% of patients on the highest dose discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal side effects. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year.</p>

Proponents argue this could increase diversification and returns, but some financial advisors express concern over the complexity, higher fees, and potential risks for unsophisticated investors.

This article from The Atlantic explores the shifting explanations for the market's strength, from economic fundamentals to Federal Reserve liquidity, none of which fully account for its recent performance. A leading current theory points to an AI-driven speculative bubble, concentrated in a few "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, while another suggests the rise of passive investing has created a market that continually expands regardless of economic conditions. The piece concludes that no single theory can definitively explain the market's unprecedented and resilient run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This long-form article from The Atlantic tells the story of Fred Walecki, the owner of Westwood Music, a Los Angeles instrument shop that became the epicenter for the 1960s and '70s folk-rock scene. The son of a classical instrument expert, Walecki transformed the family business into a clubhouse for legendary musicians like Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, the Eagles, and Joni Mitchell. More than just a salesman, he was a confidant, an innovator, and a matchmaker who connected artists with the perfect instruments to shape their sound. The article paints an intimate portrait of a man whose passion and integrity were instrumental in the creation of an iconic era of American music.</p>

          <p>Six locations of major significance to Los Angeles's Black history, including the former home of Mayor Tom and Ethel Bradley, have been officially designated as Historic Cultural Monuments. The designation is the result of a collaboration between the Getty and the city's Office of Historic Resources to identify and protect Black heritage sites. The other newly landmarked sites are Stylesville Barbershop, St. Elmo Village, Jewel’s Catch One nightclub, the California Eagle newspaper building, and New Bethel Baptist Church. This status will help preserve the buildings and formally recognize their role in the city's cultural and historical narrative.</p>

          <p>This article from The Economist critiques the Trump administration's foreign policy, particularly its approach to democracy abroad. It highlights a recent memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructing diplomats to cease "opining" on the fairness of foreign elections, a move framed as respecting national sovereignty. The piece questions how this policy aligns with the administration's actions, such as its critical stance towards Brazil. It presents this as an example of a contradictory foreign policy that may not ultimately serve American interests, despite its "America First" branding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel's security cabinet is set to meet to discuss a proposal for a complete military takeover of the Gaza Strip, a plan that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly views as necessary to defeat Hamas. This potential move has drawn alarm from the United Nations, which warned of "catastrophic consequences" for Palestinian civilians and the remaining hostages. Reports indicate that top Israeli military leaders have reservations, cautioning that a full occupation could entrap soldiers and further endanger the hostages. The war has already created a severe humanitarian crisis, with the majority of Gaza's population displaced and facing famine-like conditions.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly boosted by the strong performance of its film studios, which released several box office hits. The studios segment saw its revenue increase by 55% to $3.8 billion, thanks to the success of films like "A Minecraft Movie" and "F1," which collectively grossed $2 billion globally. CEO David Zaslav noted the division's turnaround, attributing it to strategic hires and a focus on major franchises like "Lord of the Rings" and "Superman." The company expects the momentum to continue, projecting at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the studios for the full year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent tragedy where at least 92 people, mostly Ethiopians, drowned, this article examines the extreme dangers migrants face on the "Eastern Route" across the Bab al-Mandab strait to Yemen. The number of people attempting this crossing to reach wealthy Gulf states is increasing annually, despite risks from overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, ruthless smugglers, and the lack of any official sea rescue operations. The busy shipping lane, combined with treacherous waters and the threat of piracy, makes rescue by commercial vessels unlikely.

Trump's proposed tariffs are part of his strategy to encourage more manufacturing within the U.S., citing both economic and national security reasons. However, major tech companies like Apple and Samsung may be exempt due to their significant investments in U.S.-based chip fabrication plants.</p>

          <p>Despite the planned meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin, a swift resolution to the war in Ukraine remains unlikely due to the vast differences in their positions. Russia's core demands, including the annexation of several Ukrainian regions and Ukraine's demilitarization, are fundamentally unacceptable to Kyiv and amount to a call for surrender. This analysis suggests Putin may be engaging in talks to fend off further U.S. sanctions or to persuade Trump of Russia's position, given Trump's past reluctance to fully condemn the Russian leader. Ukrainian officials express concern that without their participation, a deal could be struck at their expense.</p>
