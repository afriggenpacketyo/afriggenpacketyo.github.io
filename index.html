            <p>Despite Russia's declared Easter truce, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy reported continued shelling and assaults by Russian forces along the front lines. Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating an "impression" of a ceasefire while still attempting to advance in some areas. He stated that Ukrainian soldiers are responding to these actions and reiterated Ukraine's proposal to extend the truce for 30 days. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these reports.</p>
