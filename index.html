          <p>Newly unsealed documents suggest that Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, may have had more knowledge than he admitted during his Senate confirmation hearing about the Justice Department's decision to drop charges against Mayor Eric Adams.  A draft letter indicates Blanche was aware of the decision before his confirmation.  The Mayor's lawyer argues this supports dismissing the case.</p>
