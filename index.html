          <p>The United States and Iran held negotiations in Oman regarding Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. These discussions, described as serious and work-focused, involved exchanging written points and addressing both major and detailed disagreements. While progress was made, differences remain, and both parties agreed to meet again in Europe, with Omani officials mediating. The talks aim to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, amidst warnings of potential military strikes if a deal isn't reached. Optimism is cautiously present as the Iranian rial has shown signs of recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge expressed concerns over the deportation of a 2-year-old American citizen to Honduras, alleging it occurred without due process. The judge highlighted that the toddler was deported alongside her mother and sister, even as the court sought clarification on her status. The Department of Homeland Security claimed the parents consented to the child's deportation, but the judge questioned this assertion, especially given the father's apparent presence in the United States. The case raises questions about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement practices and the rights of American citizens in deportation proceedings.</p>
