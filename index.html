          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intent to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, asserting that the American movie industry is rapidly declining due to foreign incentives attracting filmmakers. Trump conveyed his decision via his Truth Social platform, directing the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate the tariff process, labeling it a "National Security threat" and propaganda. This move follows a series of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on various countries, aimed at bolstering U.S. manufacturing and employment, but has resulted in global economic instability and rising prices. The US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's inconsistent performance with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3. May gave up two home runs to Austin Riley, both resulting from poorly executed sweepers, which ultimately determined the outcome of the game. While May was effective outside of those pitches, his recent struggles highlight the challenges he faces in maintaining consistency after returning from elbow surgeries. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, failing to provide May with adequate run support despite a late home run by Miguel Rojas. The article emphasizes the importance of May's sweeper pitch to his success and his recent frustrations with its inconsistency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz, the former prison island off the coast of California, to house the nation's most dangerous criminals. Trump stated that this action would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice, citing concerns about repeat criminal offenders. Alcatraz, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, is currently a tourist site. The reopening aims to address what Trump sees as a need to incarcerate ruthless and violent offenders, reflecting his broader approach to criminal justice.</p>
