          <p>President Trump refuted a U.S. intelligence report suggesting that recent airstrikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, insisting the program was "totally obliterated." Trump acknowledged the Defense Intelligence Agency's report but claimed its data was insufficient and that news outlets ignored the assessment's mention of "very severe" damage. He maintained his claim, along with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, that the strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear capabilities, despite the intelligence community's initial findings, and accused news outlets of undermining the pilots who carried out the strikes. Trump emphasized the attacks had a devastating impact, suggesting that Iran's nuclear program has been set back for years. </p>

Lawmakers and experts stressed the importance of maintaining export controls on advanced chips to China and ensuring that AI systems built in democracies reflect democratic values. The proposed No Adversarial AI Act aims to identify and ban AI systems developed by foreign adversaries from use in the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its prison population, projected to decrease by roughly 60 percent by 2035. This trend is attributed to a drop in crime rates among younger generations, leading to fewer young offenders entering the prison system. The impact of this shift is now being felt as the prison population from the high-crime era of the late 20th century gradually diminishes. Experts suggest policies to accelerate decarceration, such as opposing new prison construction and compassionate release of sick and aging inmates.</p>

          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases if you pay your full statement balance by the due date. It's essentially a temporary, interest-free loan, typically lasting 21 to 25 days. To maximize the benefits of a grace period, pay your full statement balance by the due date every month, automate payments, track your billing cycle, and avoid cash advances. Understanding and utilizing your credit card's grace period can help you avoid hefty interest charges and make the most of your credit card benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
