Allen's approach involves producing evergreen, family-friendly comedy that has a long shelf life, a stark contrast to the expensive, topical nature of traditional late-night shows.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer has fully restored its click and collect service, 15 weeks after a major cyber attack forced it to halt online and in-store collections. The ransomware attack, which also led to the theft of some customer data, is estimated to cost the retailer around £300 million in lost profits for the year. While services are returning to normal, the company advises customers to remain vigilant for potential scams, and a police investigation into the incident is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Despite public awareness, less than 10% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with the vast majority ending up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment. Key hurdles include the thousands of different plastic types, many of which are difficult to process, and the presence of hazardous chemical additives that can contaminate recycling streams. Experts argue that while innovative recycling methods are being developed, the crisis cannot be solved without significant policy changes and a drastic reduction in overall plastic production.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, are investigating a potential link between the discovery of a man's body and a "brutal" attack on a local priest. The priest, Fr.

Shortly after, a body was found at a nearby house, and a 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, with police exploring the connection between the two shocking events.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's decision, led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to cut $500 million from mRNA vaccine research is a perilous move for global health. The author highlights the cancellation of funding for a late-stage H5N1 avian flu vaccine as particularly dangerous, given the virus's pandemic potential. The article contends that these cuts, driven by anti-science rhetoric, erode public health infrastructure and leave the world more vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently claimed he will cut drug prices by as much as 1,500%, a mathematically impossible figure, as he intensifies pressure on pharmaceutical companies. His main strategy involves pushing drugmakers to adopt "Most Favored Nation" pricing, where the U.S. pays no more than other developed countries. While the administration has limited direct power, Trump is using executive orders and public pressure to demand voluntary compliance, threatening repercussions for companies that do not lower their prices for American consumers.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff policies have significantly increased federal revenue from customs, with tens of billions of new dollars collected. However, this amount is still a small fraction of the government's primary income source, income taxes, and is unlikely to make a substantial dent in the nearly $37 trillion national debt. Economists also note that the revenue gain may be offset by the tariffs' negative impact on broader economic growth, and the strategy's effectiveness is limited if it successfully incentivizes domestic production.
