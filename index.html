          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of Trump Mobile, a mobile phone plan and a $499 smartphone, set to launch in September. The $47.45-per-month plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data, as well as roadside assistance and a "Telehealth and Pharmacy Benefit." The company will also sell a "T1" smartphone featuring a gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag. This venture is the latest example of Trump's business capitalizing on his association with the presidency through licensing agreements, similar to watches, sneakers, and Bibles. The monthly price and name of the wireless service are references to Trump's past and present presidential terms.</p>

          <p>Residents in Spain, along with other popular European destinations, protested against mass tourism, citing rising housing costs and displacement of locals. Protesters in Barcelona and Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns as part of a coordinated effort across southern Europe. Rent increases and the proliferation of tourist-oriented businesses have fueled discontent among residents who feel pushed out of their own neighborhoods. The Barcelona town hall has announced plans to eliminate all short-term rental licenses by 2028, while the short-term rental industry argues it is being unfairly targeted for broader policy inefficiencies.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to strip USAID and public broadcasting of $9.4 billion by a 214-212 vote. The bill represents the first chance for the GOP to make good on proposed cuts. The passage of the bill was initially uncertain, requiring last-minute negotiations to secure enough votes from Republican representatives. Speaker Johnson touted the bill as fulfilling promises to the American people for responsible government, but the vote was overshadowed by news of Senator Alex Padilla's detainment. </p>

Judge Arun Subramanian cited "several inconsistencies" in court transcripts, suggesting the juror may have been deceptive to get on the jury. The juror has been replaced by an alternative juror, and Combs' lawyers had opposed the decision, fearing prejudice due to the dismissal of a black male. The judge emphasized the need to preserve the integrity of the court, noting the availability of alternative jurors.</p>

          <p>A review into abuse carried out by grooming gangs in England and Wales highlights flaws in data collection, making it impossible to assess the scale of the issue. The report calls for mandatory collection of ethnicity and nationality data for all suspects in child sexual abuse cases. It also recommends a full national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, overseen by an Independent Commission. The report further suggests tightening the law so adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault, and closing loopholes in taxi licensing to protect children.</p>

Trump alleged, without evidence, that these cities use "illegal aliens" to expand their voter base.

This announcement comes amid reports of ICE being over budget and potentially running out of funds and follows a recent order to halt workplace immigration enforcement actions in certain industries.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu declared that military operations were "clearing the path" for Iranians to achieve freedom and end the Islamic regime's nuclear threat. Some analysts believe Israel aims to cripple Iran's nuclear program and derail potential peace talks.

          <p>Despite the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, financial markets have largely shrugged off the events, with U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Investors are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that disrupts the global economy. Deutsche Bank notes that geopolitical events typically only impact markets when they affect macro variables like growth and inflation. The biggest risk to oil prices is Iran shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, which could cause prices to spike above $100 a barrel, though analysts believe this is unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kenya's Deputy Inspector General Eliud Lagat has resigned amid an investigation into the death of blogger Albert Ojwang, who was found dead in police custody after being arrested for accusing Lagat of corruption on social media. Protests have erupted in Nairobi, calling for Lagat's resignation, and President William Ruto has pledged to protect citizens from rogue police officers. A pathology report indicated that Ojwang sustained injuries pointing towards assault, contradicting police claims that he died from hitting his head against the cell wall. Two officers have been arrested in connection with the death, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza claims she sang the national anthem in Spanish at Dodger Stadium despite an employee telling her to sing it in English. Nezza, whose full name is Vanessa HernÃ¡ndez, posted a video on TikTok showing an unidentified Dodgers employee telling her they were going to sing the song in English. Nezza said she wanted to sing the version commissioned by the U.S. Department of State in 1945 in light of recent immigration raids. A team official said there were no consequences for her performance and that she would be welcome back at the stadium.</p>

          <p>Telehealth companies are testing the FDA's rules by continuing to make and sell compounded versions of obesity drugs. OrderlyMeds, for example, plans to personalize the medicines by adding supplements based on patients' unique needs, arguing that this makes the drugs individualized rather than copies. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to make copies of brand-name drugs when those medicines are in short supply, but that grace period is ending as shortages of brand-name drugs are over. Experts are questioning where the line is between making "essentially a copy" of a commercially available drug and the personalized medicines compounding pharmacies have provided for decades.</p>
