          <p>A recent poll indicates that President Donald Trump's job approval rating has fallen to the lowest level in 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance. The poll reveals widespread disapproval of Trump's policies and significant economic discontent, including fears of a recession. A majority of those polled believe that Trump's economic policies will cause a recession, and express concern about rising prices and the impact of tariffs. Despite the negative assessments, Trump maintains an advantage over Democrats in Congress regarding trust to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

          <p>Australian politicians are considering capping the number of international students as a potential solution to the country's housing affordability crisis. The argument is that reducing international student intake will decrease demand for rental properties and starter homes, thus lowering prices. This represents a significant shift for Australia, which has historically viewed international education as a key economic sector. Critics argue that international students contribute significantly to the economy and that more targeted solutions, such as improving selection criteria, should be explored instead of blanket restrictions.</p>

One of the deported children has a rare form of metastatic cancer and was allegedly deported without medication or medical consultations.

          <p>A British Airways flight from Washington, D.C., to London was diverted to Boston Logan International Airport after a suspected bird strike and reports of smoke in the cabin. British Airways Flight 216, a Boeing 777, landed safely as a precaution, and engineers are inspecting the aircraft. There were no reported injuries, and the FAA will investigate the incident. The number of reported bird strikes has been steadily increasing in recent years due to rising wildlife populations and increased aviation traffic.</p>
