          <p>The FBI has identified Elpidio Reyna, a 40-year-old man from Compton, as the suspect who allegedly threw rocks at police and law enforcement vehicles during an immigration protest in Paramount, California. The incident, which occurred on Alondra Boulevard, resulted in injuries to a federal officer and damage to government vehicles. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to Reyna's arrest and conviction. The protests were sparked by immigration raids in areas with large Latino populations. </p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff members who raised concerns about the UK's potential complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were told that resigning was an option if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. Senior civil servants responded to the staff's letter, which questioned continued arms sales and disregard for international law, by emphasizing the Civil Service's obligation to deliver government policies wholeheartedly. The response sparked outrage among officials who felt the space for challenging policy was being shut down. The Foreign Office maintains it has systems for staff to raise concerns and has rigorously applied international law in relation to the war in Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, with millions of people unable to have their desired number of children. The report cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of suitable partners as contributing factors. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UNFPA emphasizes that falling fertility rates are a crisis because many individuals feel unable to create the families they want.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with the aim of creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a landmark that will kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary for a golden age of clean energy. The government emphasizes that nuclear power is a crucial part of plans to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in risk for those aged 20 to 29, according to data from the CDC. The number of deaths under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and more cautious drug use among young people. While this trend is promising, challenges remain in reaching those with severe addiction and concerns exist about potential funding cuts to addiction services.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense attorney, Robert Alessi, moved for a mistrial in her retrial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct related to evidence about holes in the victim's sweatshirt. Alessi's dramatic move, which included wearing black gloves and slamming his hands on the podium, drew both praise and skepticism from legal experts. The defense argues that Read's vehicle never struck the victim, and that something else caused his injuries. Judge Beverly Cannone denied the motion, and the trial continues with questions raised about the prosecution's handling of evidence and witness credibility.</p>
