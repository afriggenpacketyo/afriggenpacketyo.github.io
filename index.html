          <p>Leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have gathered in China for a major summit hosted by President Xi Jinping. The meeting occurs amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly between the member states and the United States over trade and security issues. The discussions aim to strengthen regional cooperation and present the 10-member bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India, as a significant alternative to Western-led international forums. This summit marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, signaling a potential reset in relations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United clinched a dramatic 3-2 win against Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty, providing a moment of relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent goalkeeping errors that have plagued the team early in the season. Following mistakes in previous matches, goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made another critical error that led to a Burnley goal. Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers and the entire squad, stating that everyone at the club needs to improve as they struggle with consistency.</p>

          <p>UCLA's college football season began with a disappointing 43-10 blowout loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl, exposing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The defense struggled immensely, failing to pressure Utah's quarterback and missing numerous tackles, allowing the Utes to convert 14 of 16 third downs. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had an inconsistent debut, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided defeat marked a significant step backward for the program after showing promise at the end of the previous season.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway across Germany for neo-Nazi activist Marla-Svenja Liebich, who has failed to begin an 18-month prison sentence for incitement and defamation. An arrest warrant was issued after Liebich, formerly known as Sven Liebich, did not surrender to a women's jail as required. The case has also sparked controversy over Germany's self-identification laws, as Liebich legally changed gender after conviction and requested to be placed in a women's facility, a move critics allege is an abuse of the new legislation.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which signaled the country's open-door policy to refugees in 2015. The policy led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and has had a profound and lasting impact on German society, culture, and politics. A decade later, the nation is taking stock of both the successes in integration, such as high employment rates among refugees, and the persistent challenges, including higher unemployment rates for migrants compared to the general population.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolves by blasting loud sounds like AC/DC music and Scarlett Johansson movie clips. This non-lethal hazing technique is being tested near the California-Oregon border to interrupt wolf hunts and reduce conflicts with ranchers as wolf populations recover. The method relies on the predators' fear of novel and loud human sounds, and preliminary results have shown success in scaring the wolves away. While the technology is currently expensive, it represents a creative approach to promoting human-wildlife coexistence.</p>

Quarterback Jayden Maiava led the offense efficiently, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. USC's defense also showed significant improvement from last season, tallying five sacks and an interception returned for a touchdown. The blowout win allowed the team to give significant playing time to many of its backup players, including freshman quarterback Husan Longstreet.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report revisits the 2013 death of Forrest Hayes, a 51-year-old Google executive who died of a heroin overdose on his yacht in Santa Cruz, California. Hayes was with Alix Tichelman, a woman he met through a "sugar daddy" website, who was captured on the yacht's security cameras injecting him with the drug. The video showed that after Hayes lost consciousness, Tichelman made no attempt to call for help, instead gathering her belongings and cleaning the scene before leaving. She later pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to six years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intention to issue an executive order requiring voter identification for every vote cast in the United States, stating there would be "NO EXCEPTIONS!" In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also reiterated his call to ban mail-in voting, except for military personnel and the infirm. This move is the latest in Trump's ongoing efforts to challenge and reshape the U.S. electoral system, though the constitutional authority of a president to enact such sweeping changes to state-administered elections is unclear.</p>

          <p>Recent polling in Taiwan shows the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has seen its favorability rating rise to 36.3 percent, surpassing that of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This shift comes as discontent with the DPP has increased significantly. Despite the apparent political opportunity, the KMT is reportedly experiencing internal anxiety over its future leadership, as current chairman Eric Chu is set to step down in October. The succession question is creating uncertainty within the party as it seeks to capitalize on its improved standing.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that, if elected, her government would remove all net zero requirements on companies drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. The policy would shift focus entirely to "maximising extraction" of fossil fuels, a move that establishes a clear ideological divide with the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses. Badenoch argued it was "absurd" for the UK to leave resources untapped, while the government warned that new exploration would not lower bills and would accelerate the climate crisis.</p>

His comments come as Zelenskyy voiced frustration over what he described as Russia's lack of constructive engagement and efforts to drag out negotiations, while Russian forces continue their offensive along the front line in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>While overall beer consumption in Germany has fallen to its lowest level in over 30 years, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013. This trend reflects a shift in consumer habits, with many younger Germans becoming more health-conscious. German breweries are adapting to this change by marketing alcohol-free varieties as healthy lifestyle products and alternatives to energy drinks at sporting events. Despite the surge in popularity of non-alcoholic options, traditional full-strength beer remains a deeply ingrained part of German culture.</p>
