          <p>President Trump has ordered the dismissal of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report indicated a significant slowdown in hiring. The report showed a weaker-than-expected addition of 73,000 jobs and a major downward revision for May and June. The move has drawn criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who express concern that politicizing the nonpartisan agency could undermine the integrity of crucial economic data relied upon by markets. The administration defended the firing by citing a series of major revisions that raised concerns about the commissioner's decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting raids based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit against Trump administration sweeps in Southern California that advocates argued were unconstitutional. The court affirmed that these factors do not constitute reasonable suspicion for detaining individuals. While the administration argues these actions target criminals, pro-immigrant groups praised the decision for protecting communities from what they describe as indiscriminate and fear-inducing enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has initiated an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump, for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This federal law restricts the political activities of federal employees. The investigation follows a request from Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith acted as a political operative by pushing for a rushed trial of Trump before the election. Smith, who resigned in January, had overseen the cases related to Trump's handling of classified documents and efforts concerning the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly launched an investigation into allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, 'Strictly Come Dancing.' The claims were first reported by The Sun on Sunday, which stated the issue was widely discussed among the show's cast and crew. An external law firm has been hired to lead the probe, which was prompted by a legal submission from a former celebrity contestant. The BBC confirmed it has clear protocols for serious complaints and has recently implemented new welfare measures for the long-running program amid other controversies.</p>

The incident was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 seismic event, which also resulted in one other fatality outside the mine. Over 100 rescuers are involved in the extensive search operation at one of the world's largest underground copper mines, located south of Santiago.

          <p>Luka Doncic has officially signed a contract extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, solidifying his role as the franchise's future cornerstone. The 26-year-old superstar, acquired in a trade from the Dallas Mavericks last season, announced the deal himself, expressing excitement to pursue championships in Los Angeles. While the exact terms were not disclosed, the signing ends speculation about his potential departure and signals the team's transition to a post-LeBron James era.

This approach is part of a broader effort to define the new party's platform and values through grassroots involvement. The party cannot field candidates in elections until it officially registers a name with the Electoral Commission, which has strict rules to prevent confusion with existing parties.</p>

          <p>The Swiss village of Blatten was recently destroyed by a massive landslide, forcing the evacuation of its 300 residents and highlighting a growing threat to alpine communities. Climate scientists warn that melting glaciers and thawing permafrost are destabilizing mountains, making such catastrophic events more frequent and unpredictable. The disaster has sparked a national debate in Switzerland about the immense cost of protecting and rebuilding these vulnerable villages versus the painful possibility of permanent relocation.

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a physician in 1988, felt unsuited for the medical profession and recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when breaking bad news to patients. His stepfather's death at age 54 made him realize he did not want to spend his life in a job he wasn't passionate about. This pivotal moment set him on a new path in the early 1990s, leading to a successful career in entertainment.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for £30 million, despite his recent statements expressing a desire to stay with the club. The potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. While the club insists it can make new signings without first selling players, offloading Hojlund would help them comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. Selling Hojlund at this price would represent a book loss for the club, as he is only two years into the five-year contract he signed.</p>

For decades, it was rumored the creature died from shell-shock caused by a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent analysis of the platypus attendant's logbook by university researchers revealed the real cause was likely extreme heat. As the ship crossed the equator, recorded water and air temperatures soared well above the safe threshold for the species, essentially cooking the animal alive before it could reach England.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. Protests in London, Newcastle, and Manchester saw confrontations, leading to arrests for public order offenses and other charges. These demonstrations are part of a recent series of protests targeting asylum accommodations. The Home Office has stated it is reducing the number of hotels used for this purpose and plans to end their use entirely by 2029 as part of a strategy to 'restore order' to the asylum system.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first Scottish Premiership match of the season. Martin stated his team was 'lucky to get a point' and that their opponents were braver and more aggressive. In a blunt post-game assessment, he lambasted what he called a 'mentality problem' and suggested some players needed to 'drop their ego.' The harsh comments so early in the season have surprised pundits and raised concerns about the team's direction under the new manager.</p>

This scenario reflects an NFL ritual where only one specialist survives the final roster cuts, leaving the loser unemployed.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a strong performance in his first start since returning from a shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his return was spoiled by two home runs from Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz, who took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite Snell showing flashes of his Cy Young-winning form and not issuing any walks, the Dodgers' offense was shut out in a 4-0 loss. The outing was still seen as a promising step for the pitcher and the team's late-season rotation depth.</p>
