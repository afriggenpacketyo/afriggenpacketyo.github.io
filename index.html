          <p>President Trump is advocating for the use of coal to power AI data centers, aiming to revive the struggling coal industry, but this clashes with the environmental goals of tech companies. While the tech industry is investing in renewable energy and nuclear power, the short-term electricity demand from AI may inadvertently extend the life of existing coal plants. Some industry insiders acknowledge that fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, will be needed to meet energy demands, but are wary of using coal.
