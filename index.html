          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts a slowdown in global economic growth due to President Trump's tariffs, impacting even the UK. The OECD has downgraded growth expectations for the US and UK, citing rising trade barriers and widespread uncertainty caused by Trump's unpredictable tariff policies. While Trump claims tariffs are boosting the US economy, recent data indicates a contraction in the first quarter of the year, contradicting his assertions. The OECD suggests the UK should consider raising taxes to strengthen public finances, as the country faces challenges including substantial government debt interest payments.

          <p>Fashion brand The North Face and luxury jeweler Cartier have both reported cyber attacks resulting in the theft of customer data. North Face discovered a "small-scale" attack in April, while Cartier reported unauthorized access to their systems. Both companies confirmed that names and email addresses were compromised, but financial information remained secure. These breaches are part of a recent wave of cyber attacks targeting high-profile retailers, prompting the UK's National Crime Agency to prioritize catching the responsible criminals. Customers of North Face and Cartier are advised to change their passwords and remain vigilant for potential phishing attempts.</p>

          <p>At least 27 people were killed and over 90 injured near a humanitarian aid distribution center in the southern Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged a shooting 500 meters from an aid site, stating that forces fired at suspects moving towards them after they deviated from designated routes. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid site, reported safe distribution but acknowledged the IDF's investigation into potential injuries outside the safe corridor. The United Nations has called for an independent investigation into similar incidents, as the GHF's operations have faced reports of violence.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy's shares surged 15% after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy, representing the entire output of the plant's nuclear reactor, starting in June 2027. This agreement supports the plant's continued operation and relicensing, which was at risk due to expiring zero-emissions credits. The deal will expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts and contribute to Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity, though the plant will not directly power Meta's data centers.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after US private equity giant KKR withdrew from a Â£4bn rescue deal, increasing the possibility of government-supervised administration. The company faces huge debts and struggles to fix leaks, stop sewage spills, and modernize outdated infrastructure. The government has stated it is ready to take over Thames Water if needed, but the company is pursuing an alternative plan with its creditors. An independent review has found the water sector in England and Wales is failing and needs stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment.</p>

Officials have cautioned about the risk of terrorism due to lax border enforcement, while Democrats argue that U.S. citizens are primarily responsible for domestic terrorist activity.

          <p>Male beauty standards are evolving to focus more on hypermasculinity, influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces. Trends include shaving off eyelashes and engaging in tongue exercises to achieve a square jaw. This shift appears driven by a desire to impress other men and reject anything considered feminine. The pursuit of these standards can lead to body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring the struggles faced by young women. This trend underscores a growing divide between male and female perceptions of attractiveness.</p>

The expansion of agriculture and pastures is obliterating wild landscapes and releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Producing enough food for a growing population while shrinking the agricultural footprint requires innovative solutions, including new crops, foods, policies, and behaviors. While energy solutions are mostly political, food and climate solutions are still analytical, requiring more research and development to achieve sustainability.</p>

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s face a different kind of midlife crisis compared to previous generations, often lacking the financial stability to afford traditional markers of success. Many are seeking opportunities for personal growth and change, such as fitness journeys, career shifts, and tattoos, rather than interventions. Economic factors and societal pressures contribute to feelings of uncertainty and longing for security. Despite these challenges, millennials are often more equipped to navigate midlife in a healthy way, supported by diverse social circles and a focus on self-discovery.</p>
