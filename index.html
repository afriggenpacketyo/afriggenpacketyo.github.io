          <p>Speech and Language UK reports that children with speech and language difficulties are at a higher risk of developing mental health issues like anxiety and depression. According to the charity, almost half of young people referred to mental health services also face significant speech and language challenges, such as difficulty learning new words or understanding non-verbal cues. The charity advocates for improved speech and language training for teachers and mental health professionals, as well as better information sharing between schools and mental health teams. The government has committed to providing mental health support in every secondary school in England by 2030, making it essential to spot and adapt support for children with both communication and mental health needs. </p>

          <p>Hundreds of UK veterans are taking legal action against 3M, alleging they were issued defective earplugs during their service, leading to hearing loss. The claim, launched by KP Law, alleges that the Combat Arms Earplugs, supplied by 3M to the Ministry of Defence between 2003 and 2023, had a design defect preventing a complete seal in the ear. 3M, which acquired the original manufacturer Aearo Technologies in 2008, is accused of knowing about the defect. The lawsuit follows a $6 billion settlement by 3M in the US regarding the same earplugs, although the company accepted no liability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homeland, reversing a lower court order that required migrants to have a chance to argue against being deported to third countries.

          <p>This article analyzes the true impact of President Trump's strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, noting that while the operation achieved tactical success, the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities remains uncertain. Top advisors have given differing accounts about the fate of Iran's enriched uranium stockpiles, and Iranian leaders have shown no indication of surrendering their nuclear program. Experts suggest that Iran's nuclear capacities have been set back significantly, but the long-term standoff is far from over. The article also notes that Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. air base in Qatar, but there was no significant damage, suggesting a winding down of military confrontation.</p>

          <p>NHS England will offer at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed coming forward for cervical screening, starting in January. The DIY test kits contain a long cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancers. The scheme aims to tackle barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time, hoping to increase screening rates closer to the NHS England target of 80%. Women with a negative HPV test will wait five years for their next screening appointment, instead of three, based on research showing they are at very low risk of cervical cancer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden places like South Sudan. The court's conservative supermajority paused a ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who said immigrants deserved a "meaningful opportunity" to bring claims that they would face torture or death if removed to certain countries. The decision allows the administration to swiftly deport immigrants to so-called "third countries." Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the court of "rewarding lawlessness" in her dissenting opinion.</p>

He added that the market has concluded Iran will not close the strait, as evidenced by the drop in oil prices. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

Animal charities and vets report that some owners are giving up pets to rehoming centers, while others are forgoing future pet ownership due to high costs. Many veterinary professionals attribute the price increases to the acquisition of practices by large corporations. The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating whether a lack of competition in the veterinary sector has contributed to soaring prices.</p>

Local governments support this practice by creating extra licenses, fast-tracking tax rebate claims, and investing in export infrastructure. The practice is driven by ambitious economic growth targets set by Beijing, but it has drawn criticism for driving down prices and damaging Chinese brands' image abroad. (not investment advice)</p>
