          <p>A New York City police officer was killed and another wounded after a gunman opened fire inside a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, identified as a man from Nevada, also killed two civilians and critically injured another before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident occurred on the 33rd floor of 345 Park Avenue, which houses offices for Blackstone and the NFL, prompting a massive police response and lockdown of the area. Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD urged the public to avoid the vicinity as authorities secured the scene.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza, following warnings of mass starvation. Starmer presented the plan to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland, emphasizing the need for immediate relief. The move comes amid growing domestic pressure, with over 250 MPs signing a letter urging the government to recognize Palestinian statehood. The proposed plan aims to provide a pathway to a two-state solution and build on collaboration with France and Germany.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders revealed he was diagnosed with high-risk bladder cancer, a fact he had kept private from his team and the public. During a press conference with his medical team, he announced that he is now considered "cancer-free" following successful treatment. The procedure involved the robotic removal of his bladder and the creation of a new one from his own intestines. Sanders became emotional while discussing his journey and expressed hope that his story would encourage others to schedule health checkups.</p>

          <p>School districts across the U.S. are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions in federal grant funding. The administration cited concerns that the funds were used for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a claim disputed by service providers. This has left many districts, particularly in rural areas, at risk of losing counselors and social workers, exacerbating a nationwide shortage of child mental health professionals. Sixteen states are now suing the Department of Education over the cuts.</p>

In Hancock County, which has the highest rate of child food insecurity in the U.S., residents on fixed incomes rely on local pantries to supplement meager benefits. A CBS News analysis projects billions will be cut from SNAP over the next decade, while other federal food programs have also been reduced.

The pact imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods will enter the EU tariff-free. In exchange, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and increase investment. While the deal avoids a feared 30% tariff, economists at Société Générale suggest the EU accepted unfavorable terms to prevent a trade war, potentially reducing its annual GDP.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that recent major trade deals, including the U.S.-EU agreement, failed to produce a significant market rally because investor focus is elsewhere. He stated that Wall Street is currently preoccupied with this week's Big Tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. Cramer suggested investors have "tariff ennui," as the deals follow a predictable pattern and major negotiations with China, Canada, and Mexico are still pending. He believes the market will not react significantly to trade policy until these other major economic events have passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court is reviewing a lower court's order that blocked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" and detaining individuals in Southern California without reasonable suspicion. The case stems from concerns that ICE agents were using criteria like race, location, or language as a pretext for enforcement, violating the 4th Amendment. During arguments, 9th Circuit judges questioned the Justice Department's justification for the sweeps. The outcome of the case could set a significant precedent for the limits of federal immigration enforcement authority.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogota has convicted former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe of witness tampering, a landmark ruling marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal case. Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, was found to have bribed witnesses to provide false testimony in a separate investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized case could result in a prison sentence of up to 12 years. Uribe maintains the proceedings are politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where he contradicted an ally by stating he sees "real starvation stuff" on television, highlight his reliance on media visuals to form policy opinions. An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that despite having access to vast intelligence resources, Trump's worldview is heavily influenced by what he sees on the news, particularly on channels like Fox News. This makes him susceptible to manipulation but also attunes him to shifts in public opinion. His TV-driven perspective on Gaza has put him at odds with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's official statements.</p>

While the case did not set new legal precedent, it served as a major jolt to media outlets, reinforcing the limits of First Amendment protections when publishing graphic content. Scholars note the case highlighted the public's right to privacy in the digital age, particularly regarding revenge porn and newsworthiness versus invasion of privacy.</p>
