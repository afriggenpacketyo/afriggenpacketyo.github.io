          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics company L'Oréal. The conflict began when L'Oréal opposed her attempt to re-register the name 'nkd' for her business, claiming it would create consumer confusion with its 'Naked' product line. Having already spent over £30,000 in legal fees, the owner remains determined to fight the opposition, stating that the corporate giant likely expects her to give up, which she has no intention of doing.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The abundance of aphids has provided a plentiful food source, and many butterfly species were sighted weeks earlier than average. However, experts express concern that the prolonged dry conditions could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year by drying out wetland habitats essential for laying eggs.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit alleged that these policies unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's ordinance and enhances public safety by allowing police to focus on local community needs rather than federal immigration agendas.</p>

The other aircraft was a privately owned Hawker Hunter fighter jet that crossed its path at a similar altitude. The evasive maneuver caused a terrifying free-fall sensation for passengers and resulted in injuries to two flight attendants. The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the near-miss incident.</p>
