          <p>Facing public discontent over soaring rice prices and an upcoming election, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is pushing to reform Japan's rice policy. Rice prices have doubled, prompting Ishiba to target the decades-old production adjustment system, aiming to counter opposition parties proposing consumption tax cuts. Ishiba seeks to boost rice production and has released reserve rice to lower prices, but faces challenges including potential oversupply and market turmoil. Critics urge him not to use rice policy as a political tool. </p>

          <p>A former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Jane," testified about feeling pressured to participate in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched. She alleged that Combs' employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights," which caused her pain and infections. Prosecutors are using her testimony to support charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, with his defense arguing that the encounters were consensual. </p>

          <p>The government is facing challenges in reducing the amount of foreign aid spent on asylum hotels in the UK. New figures reveal that the Home Office plans to spend Â£2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only slightly less than the Â£2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. The funds primarily cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers, leading to cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities worldwide. The Home Office aims to end asylum hotels by speeding up decisions and tightening eligibility checks. </p>
