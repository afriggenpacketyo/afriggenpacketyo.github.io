          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, likening it to a leaderless solar system and lamenting its tendency for internal conflict over teamwork. In a speech outlining a new vision, she urged Democrats to refocus on core economic issues like job creation, housing, and affordability to reconnect with working-class Americans. Slotkin identified the party's central split as being between those who see a second Trump term as an existential threat versus those who view it as merely survivable, arguing this divide is more relevant than traditional ideological labels.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to implement a new rule that removes the 30-day warning period before levying fines on individuals in the United States illegally. This policy change, proposed by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, allows for the immediate fining of those who enter illegally or defy removal orders. Fines can reach up to $1,000 per day, reviving a practice from the first Trump term that was halted by the Biden administration and is now being reinstated as part of a broader immigration crackdown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten's recent departure from the Democratic National Committee exposes a deeply symbiotic and problematic relationship between teachers' unions and the Democratic Party. The author contends that union dues effectively fund Democratic campaigns in a quid pro quo arrangement that prioritizes political agendas over educational needs. The article suggests Weingarten's exit, possibly forced, reflects growing friction and makes a case for school choice as an alternative to what it terms politically-driven public education.</p>

The concessions will protect current recipients of certain disability and sickness benefits, with proposed cuts now set to apply only to future claimants.

          <p>During a high-level meeting between defense ministers, India has called for a permanent resolution to its protracted border dispute with China. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the need to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control and to de-escalate tensions through structured engagement. The call for a permanent demarcation solution comes as both nuclear-armed nations work to normalize relations, which have been strained since deadly clashes in 2020.</p>
