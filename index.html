          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling significantly short of expectations and raising concerns about the labor market's health. Compounding the weak report, job numbers for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, signaling a sharp and rapid deterioration. This data increases the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates in September, as indicators like the rising unemployment rate and declining labor force participation point to a persistent cooling trend.

          <p>Aviation company Joby and defense contractor L3Harris have announced a partnership to create a new military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The vehicle will be based on Joby's vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology but will use a gas turbine for military applications, unlike Joby's commercial electric models. The collaboration aims to address evolving battlefield needs for smaller, more adaptable, and potentially autonomous aircraft for roles like surveillance and logistics, with operational demonstrations expected in 2026.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman publicly explained their recent dissents against the decision to hold interest rates steady. Both officials argued that waiting to ease monetary policy poses a significant risk to the U.S. economy, particularly the labor market. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that the central bank is being overly cautious, risking falling "behind the curve" by not implementing gradual rate cuts now.

          <p>An interest-free forbearance period for millions of federal student loan borrowers in the SAVE plan has ended, meaning interest will begin accruing again.

With the SAVE plan now repealed by Congress, borrowers are being advised to explore other options like the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, though it may result in higher monthly payments for many.

While there is hope the rate could be negotiated down before it takes effect, the news has already caused the Swiss franc to slide and hit the stocks of exposed companies. (not investment advice)</p>

A fundraising page set up by family to repatriate their bodies has raised over £30,000, describing the siblings as "bright and deeply loved" and their absence as leaving an "unbearable silence."</p>

Isak, who wants to explore a move away from the club, has been training alone while his future remains uncertain.

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the "Happy Gilmore" movies, including the new sequel, are more than just comedies, conveying a traditional conservative message about the importance of family. The author notes that in both films, the protagonist, Happy, is motivated to play golf not for personal glory but for the well-being of his family—first his grandmother and now his daughter. By placing the interests of older and younger generations above his own, the character embodies an altruistic worldview centered on familial obligation, a message reinforced by Adam Sandler casting his own family in the sequel.</p>

          <p>Many international aid organizations are choosing to remain silent despite facing dramatic budget cuts from the Trump administration, a strategy some experts term "anticipatory silence." These groups, heavily dependent on U.S. government contracts, fear that speaking out could lead to further targeting and the loss of remaining programs. This approach is highly controversial within the aid sector, with some arguing it allows the administration to control the narrative, while others believe quiet, behind-the-scenes advocacy is the most effective way to protect their life-saving work.</p>

          <p>As part of its business model overhaul, Southwest Airlines has begun selling its first-ever assigned seats for flights starting next year, with prices varying based on route, timing, and seat location. A sample search shows that "preferred" seats could add over $40 each way, while extra-legroom seats could cost nearly $100, adding significant costs for travelers. This move away from its long-standing open-seating policy aligns Southwest with its rivals, who generate billions from such fees, and follows pressure from activist investors to maximize revenue.

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai has vowed to continue negotiations with the United States after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff on the island's exports. While this rate is lower than an earlier 32% threat, it is higher than the 15% secured by regional competitors like Japan and South Korea, drawing criticism in Taipei. Lai described the 20% levy as a "phased outcome" of ongoing talks, expressing hope that his government can secure a more favorable and reasonable rate for Taiwan in subsequent discussions.

Masters criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders, arguing that domestic competitions are being redesigned "at the altar of European and global expansion" at the expense of player welfare and domestic football.</p>

          <p>A new study concludes that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in southern California in early 2024 was likely caused by exposure to pesticides. Researchers found dead and twitching butterflies near a crucial overwintering site and subsequent testing revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each insect, some at lethal levels. The findings provide rare, real-world evidence supporting the theory that pesticides, particularly pyrethroids from residential use, are a significant factor in the dramatic, long-term decline of the monarch butterfly population.</p>

Analysts theorize that this cohort, shaped by the Trump era, is more pessimistic and detached from party labels, making them a volatile group that could react against whichever party is in power rather than forming a stable coalition.</p>
