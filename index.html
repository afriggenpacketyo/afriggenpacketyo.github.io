          <p>Patrick Schwarzenegger discusses his role as Saxon Ratliff in the latest season of HBO's "The White Lotus," a character he describes as a "sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro." Schwarzenegger initially had reservations about the role, particularly regarding the extent of the character's sexual behavior and nudity. He also shares anecdotes about series creator Mike White joking about Schwarzenegger not appearing rich enough despite his famous family. He acknowledges the advantages his name brings but emphasizes his desire to forge his own path in acting, having spent a decade in acting class and recently starring in HBO's "The Staircase."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking at the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, condemned the American strikes in Iran as "outrageous." He placed the blame for the consequences of the strikes squarely on the U.S., stating that Washington is solely responsible for the implications of its aggression. Araghchi appeared to dismiss diplomatic solutions for the time being, accusing the U.S. of betraying diplomacy and negotiations and denouncing both Israel and the U.S. for attacking Iran amidst diplomatic talks. He also accused Trump of betraying his promise to avoid "forever wars."</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified the U.S. position on the recent strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, asserting that the U.S. is not at war with Iran itself, but rather with Iran's nuclear program. Vance stated that the president took decisive action to dismantle the program, claiming that the strikes have significantly hindered Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. While unable to definitively confirm the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear program, Vance expressed confidence that the U.S. has set it back substantially, potentially delaying weapon development for years. This statement attempts to de-escalate fears of a broader conflict.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have revealed details of the U.S. operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," which targeted three nuclear sites in Iran. According to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers and was the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history," causing "extremely severe damage and destruction." The mission, which included multiple in-flight refuelings and support from fighter jets, also utilized deception tactics and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the operation as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or civilians, but rather the Iranian nuclear program.</p>

The author draws parallels between Trump's actions and historical attempts to suppress Black culture, particularly referencing the Black Arts Movement (BAM). BAM's success in establishing independent Black institutions and scholarship is highlighted as a model for cultural resistance. The article critiques the emphasis on diversity and inclusion as insufficient, arguing that Black culture's true power lies in challenging white cultural dominance.</p>

          <p>Following the US attacks on nuclear facilities in Iran, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for Iran to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Israel and the US. Reactions from German politicians have been mixed, with some supporting the strikes as a setback for Iran's nuclear program, while others express disappointment. Meanwhile, the German military has conducted its first direct evacuation flights from Israel, and continues to evacuate Germans from Jordan. The German government had previously withdrawn personnel from its embassy in Tehran.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing challenges in the Tokyo assembly election, which is seen as a bellwether for the upcoming House of Councillors race. Exit polls suggest that Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is likely to perform well, particularly among independent voters. The election outcome could impact the national political landscape, potentially influencing Ishiba's leadership and economic policies. The race features a high number of candidates, with key issues including inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the US has carried out a bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, with Israel stating they were in "full co-ordination" with the US. Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 US military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers. The US said it also hit two other nuclear sites - at Natanz and Isfahan, and Caine said initial assessments indicate all three Iranian nuclear sites "sustained extreme damage and destruction". Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi condemned the US strike and said Tehran reserved the right to respond.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites will test the notion that military action can only delay, not eliminate, a determined push for nuclear weapons.
