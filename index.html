          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators participated in annual Twelfth of July parades across Northern Ireland, a major event commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The marches are a significant celebration of Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, with organizers reporting that this year's events drew some of the largest and most peaceful crowds in a generation. Government officials attended, highlighting the importance of celebrating cultural identity in a peaceful manner, while noting the vast majority of related events passed without issue. The parades, held in various locations including Belfast and Keady, featured numerous marching bands and attracted tourists who remarked on the passion and generational tradition on display.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted that the federal response to the recent deadly floods in Texas demonstrates a fundamentally different and improved approach under the Trump administration. Noem contrasted the rapid deployment of resources and pre-approved funding for Texas with what she characterized as slow and inadequate responses by the Biden administration to past disasters like the Maui fires and the Ohio train derailment. She stated that President Trump intends to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), potentially renaming it, to create a more responsive agency that empowers local and state officials. Noem emphasized that the new model focuses on immediate support rather than bureaucratic delays.</p>

          <h2>Shohei Ohtani's Strong Pitching Performance Helps Dodgers End Seven-Game Losing Streak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 18:25:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and snap a seven-game losing streak. Pitching three scoreless innings, the longest outing of his return from Tommy John surgery, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's dominant start, which included fastballs reaching nearly 100 mph, provided the momentum the team desperately needed. His continued development as a pitcher is a significant positive for the Dodgers, even as he manages a limited workload.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, a bipartisan group of Florida lawmakers toured the new 'Alligator Alcatraz' migrant detention facility in the Everglades. Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, reported 'appalling' conditions, citing extreme heat in the medical area which one measured at 85 degrees, and claims from detainees about limited water and small food portions. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the facility expressed satisfaction, with one stating the beds were more comfortable than his own at home. The state has consistently denied all accusations of inhumane conditions, stating the facility meets all required standards.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing incentives for marriage and childbirth, some experts are offering a different perspective. Many young people, like 32-year-old Tracy Li from Beijing, feel that AI advancements will eventually fulfill needs traditionally met by family, such as emotional companionship and elderly care. A leading demography expert argues that this technological revolution could redefine family structures and make traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete. This view suggests that as AI takes on more caregiving roles, the societal pressure to marry and have children for support in old age may diminish significantly.</p>

The problematic code, which instructed Grok to be provocative and 'not afraid to offend,' was active for 16 hours before being removed.

Trump labeled O'Donnell a 'threat to humanity' and argued she is not in the country's best interests. Legal experts quickly noted that the President has no authority to strip a native-born U.S. citizen of their citizenship, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that affirmed this constitutional protection.

The makeshift defense, featuring an out-of-position fullback who was later sent off, panicked under pressure from the Swedish attack.

The authors argue that Trump's success was fueled by widespread frustration with the political system's failures, allowing his supporters to identify with his legal battles as a fight against a stacked system. The book explores critical 'what-ifs,' such as Joe Biden not running for re-election, and details the internal dynamics of the Democratic campaign, including Barack Obama's warning that their efforts were 'a mess.'

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 people at protests against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The majority of arrests, including 41 in London, were on suspicion of supporting a banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The proscription follows a series of direct-action protests by the group, which has targeted arms companies involved with Israel. Critics, including the group's co-founder, have called the ban an 'authoritarian abuse' of power, while the government maintains the group's escalating criminal activity poses a risk to national security.</p>

          <p>A lightning-sparked wildfire in Arizona, named the White Sage Fire, has grown more than tenfold in 24 hours, scorching over 19,000 acres near Grand Canyon National Park. The rapidly expanding, zero-percent-contained blaze has forced the evacuation of the park's North Rim and nearby residents of Jacob Lake. Dangerous fire conditions are being fueled by high temperatures, strong winds, and dry vegetation, with an extreme heat warning in effect for the area. This incident follows the recent death of a hiker in the Grand Canyon, highlighting the severe environmental risks currently facing the region.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad has led one aviation analyst to suggest a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, may have been the cause. The report indicated the Boeing 787's engine fuel cutoff switches moved almost simultaneously, starving the engines of fuel shortly after takeoff. Former pilot Marco Chan noted that a previously issued service bulletin from the engine manufacturer warned of a flawed chip that could lead to signal loss, effectively cutting off fuel. He explained that the design of the switches makes it highly unlikely for pilots to move them accidentally during flight.</p>

They secured the championship with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel on Centre Court. The duo, who only teamed up less than a year ago, fulfilled their season goal of winning a Grand Slam, a particularly sweet victory after watching their former partners win the title together last year. Their triumph marks the first time two Britons have won a men's doubles Grand Slam since Pat Hughes and Raymond Tuckey in 1936.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Marc Cucurella reflected on his journey from a difficult start at the club to becoming a key player ahead of the Club World Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish left-back admitted he struggled initially with the pressure and high expectations after his £62m transfer, but has since found his confidence and adapted his game, notably by playing a more inverted role. A pivotal moment was his performance in the Euro 2024 final for Spain, and he has carried that form into a career-best season for goal contributions.

          <p>A government-backed report has concluded that anti-Semitism is increasingly normalized in the UK, particularly within professions, cultural life, and public services like the NHS and universities. Co-authored by Lord Mann and Dame Penny Mordaunt, the review found that Jewish people often feel merely tolerated rather than respected and are frequently held responsible for the actions of the Israeli government. The report highlights a surge in anti-Jewish hate since October 2023, noting incidents where a chaplain received death threats and threats of sexual assault against his wife. It recommends recognizing Judaism as an ethnicity and overhauling the policing of anti-Semitic crimes.</p>

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) made an emergency landing after experiencing an engine problem during a families day event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the iconic World War Two aircraft diagnosed 'unusual engine behaviour' and, as a precaution, returned to its base at RAF Coningsby. Black smoke was seen coming from one of the plane's four engines before it issued a general emergency alert. The RAF confirmed that none of the crew were injured and an investigation has been launched into the incident involving one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime kick-offs to mitigate the effects of expected high temperatures. This decision comes after concerns about player welfare were raised during the recent Club World Cup in the US, where one player described the 35C (95F) heat as 'very dangerous.' The host cities of Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver all have covered venues that will be prioritized for daytime matches. Infantino acknowledged that heat is a significant issue but expressed confidence that this logistical adjustment will help ensure player safety.</p>
