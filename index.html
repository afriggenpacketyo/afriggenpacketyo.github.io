          <p>President Trump falsely claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon to pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, despite the national average being around $3.165. This figure is actually an increase of nearly 2 cents from the previous week and $1.18 more than Trump's claim. The increase this week is the first time drivers have paid more at the pump in nearly a month. Trump administration officials pointed to RBOB gasoline futures, which did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract doesn't reflect what consumers pay at the pump as it excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not run for Senate in 2026, disappointing Republicans who viewed him as their strongest candidate to challenge vulnerable Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, cited family reasons for his decision. His complicated relationship with Donald Trump, who previously attacked Kemp for not supporting his false election claims, loomed over a potential campaign. Ossoff, who has raised $11 million in the first quarter of 2025, is preparing for a tough race, while several other Georgia Republicans may now consider running.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is considering imposing a 100% tariff on films made outside the United States to help the domestic film industry, which he claims has been decimated by other countries and incompetence. Trump plans to meet with Hollywood studios to gauge their thoughts on the proposal, emphasizing his desire to help the industry and create jobs. White House officials clarified that no final decision has been made and the administration is exploring all options to safeguard national and economic security. Film industry analysts note that tariffs on intellectual property are difficult to enforce, and tax incentives are a major factor in determining filming locations.</p>

          <p>TeleMessage, a messaging app used by former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, has temporarily suspended its services following a reported hack. The app, marketed as a secure way for government agencies to comply with record-retention laws, is a modified version of Signal. The potential hack raises concerns about the security and privacy of communications made through the app. The White House has defended the use of Signal within the administration, despite Trump previously discouraging its use after a prior leak controversy.

          <p>A brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft. This incident compounded existing issues, including air traffic control staffing shortages, runway construction, and adverse weather conditions in the New York City metro area. The communication breakdown led to hundreds of delays and cancellations and three dozen flight diversions that day. Senator Chuck Schumer called for the Office of the Inspector General to investigate the problems at Newark, citing safety concerns and outdated technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order instructing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage of treatments related to gender transition for minors. The order aimed to stop institutions that receive federal grants from providing such treatments as well. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was commissioned to publish a review of literature on best practices regarding "identity-based confusion" among children. The ban on federal funding was later blocked by a judge, but the review was published on May 1st. The article does not give any further information on the review itself.</p>

          <p>Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's decision to suspend leasing and permitting of new wind projects. The states argue that the move threatens the wind industry and a crucial source of clean energy. Trump's directive halts offshore wind lease sales and stops the issuance of permits, leases, and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects. The lawsuit seeks a court order declaring the pause unlawful and barring federal agencies from implementing Trump’s directive.</p>

Even if a trade deal is reached, Europe’s newfound wariness of its longtime ally will not easily be unwound.
