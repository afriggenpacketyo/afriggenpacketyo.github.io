          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to questions from the White House Office of Management and Budget concerning the ongoing, over-budget renovation of the Fed's headquarters. In a letter, Powell directed the OMB to a new public webpage with details about the project and refuted claims of luxurious amenities, such as a private elevator or rooftop garden. This exchange occurs amid a broader pressure campaign from the Trump administration, which has expressed frustration with the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates and has criticized Powell's management of the central bank.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This move follows public pressure and dissatisfaction from some of his supporters over the administration's handling of Epstein-related files, particularly after a recent Justice Department memo stated no "client list" existed. Legal experts note that such a request is highly unusual and that a judge's approval is required, a process that could take months and face objections from various parties involved in the original case.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting Exxon Mobil's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, which affirms standard industry practices for corporate mergers and acquisitions. The company anticipates some workforce reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their recent performance at the Glastonbury festival. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, detectives determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for any offense. The investigation was initiated after the group, known for its pro-Palestinian stance, made controversial on-stage comments. A separate investigation into comments made by the punk-rap duo Bob Vylan during their set is reportedly still ongoing.</p>

          <p>With the price of silver surging to its highest point in over a decade, some investors are considering it as a more affordable alternative to gold for portfolio diversification. The article explores the potential benefits, noting that silver offers similar protections against inflation at a fraction of the cost of gold, which is trading at record highs. However, it cautions against a complete switch, highlighting gold's historical stability and superior value. The piece advises that a balanced approach, possibly reallocating a portion of a portfolio's precious metals holdings, may be the most prudent strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has indicated that it is highly unlikely Chinese-funded factories operating in Mexico will lose their preferential trade status under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor, stated that there are no signs of restrictions targeting Chinese companies ahead of the trade deal's review next year. He suggested that any revisions to the USMCA would probably focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for products, rather than excluding specific countries from its benefits. This provides a degree of stability for Chinese firms with supply chains in Mexico.</p>

The filing was made shortly before a financing round valued Neuralink at $9 billion and at a time when Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative aimed at cutting federal agency spending.

          <p>This article examines the political tactics of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, arguing that his brand of demagoguery continues to resonate in contemporary politics. Fifty years ago, Amin framed his brutal policies, such as the expulsion of Uganda's Asian community, as a liberating "Economic War" to free the oppressed African majority from foreign control. This narrative, though based on a falsehood, proved compelling both at home and abroad, helping him maintain power for eight years. The author draws parallels to modern political movements that galvanize support by portraying an aggrieved majority as victims of outsiders.</p>

          <p>Approximately 24 million Americans with Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans may face significant cost increases next year due to a combination of factors. Insurers are proposing median rate hikes of 15%, driven by rising medical costs and policy uncertainty. A major concern is the potential expiration of enhanced federal subsidies at the end of the year, which would cause many consumers' out-of-pocket premium payments to rise sharply. Without congressional action to extend the subsidies, millions could find their coverage unaffordable, leading to a potential drop in enrollment and what experts call "sticker shock."</p>

Unlike expensive, high-profile series, kids' programming is often less costly to produce and has a longer shelf life.

          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a funding package, championed by President Trump, that claws back $9 billion in federal spending. The bill, which passed largely along party lines, cuts approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs and $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. Democrats argued against the cuts, stating they undermine US soft power and threaten access to information for rural Americans. The legislation, having already passed the Senate, now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows New Tax Bill Favors Higher-Income Households</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center indicates that President Trump's newly signed tax law will provide savings for all income groups, but higher-income households will benefit the most. The law extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on tips and overtime. The report found that approximately 60% of the tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners, who will see an average tax cut of over $12,500. In contrast, households in the bottom quintile will save an average of about $150. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna 172 aircraft and causing a major security response. Authorities state the suspect, Shaheer Cassim, threatened a flight instructor at Victoria International Airport before flying to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble F-15 fighter jets. Investigators believe the act was driven by an "ideological motive," with social media posts linked to the suspect showing warnings about climate change and claims of being a divine messenger. The plane landed safely, and no one was injured during the incident.</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is facing a significant political challenge as he attempts to pass a €44 billion budget package through a fractured parliament. To avoid a no-confidence vote that could topple his minority government, Bayrou must convince opposition Socialist lawmakers to at least abstain. The Socialists have demanded a total revision of the budget, arguing it unfairly burdens workers and pensioners while being too lenient on the wealthy. Bayrou has the summer to negotiate and adapt the bill, or he may be forced to use a constitutional power that triggers a confidence vote.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted an injunction, permitting the Trump administration's layoffs of approximately 1,400 Department of Education staffers to remain in effect. The layoffs are part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the agency. Education advocates have expressed concern that the downsizing will hinder the department's ability to administer financial aid, support students, and manage student loan programs. The decision comes as the agency is already dealing with a significant backlog of applications for income-driven repayment plans, potentially making it harder for borrowers to get assistance.</p>

The consulate also criticized extra security procedures that forced visa applicants to wait outside in the sun for long periods.

          <p>This article explores the profound ethical questions facing engineers and researchers in the field of artificial intelligence, where staggering financial rewards are juxtaposed with potentially catastrophic risks. While top AI talent can command massive salaries, they are also contributing to a technology that some leaders warn could pose an existential threat to humanity. The piece argues that working at a frontier AI lab is only ethical if one has deeply considered the risks and has a defensible reason to believe their contribution will lead to a better, safer outcome, rather than accelerating a dangerous race for profit.</p>

          <p>Residents of the southern Syrian city of Suweida have described horrific scenes of violence and a "bloodbath" following the eruption of deadly sectarian clashes between local Druze and Bedouin tribes. The deployment of government forces to restore order reportedly escalated the conflict, with witnesses accusing these forces of attacking civilians, looting homes, and carrying out summary executions. Hundreds of people, including many civilians, have been killed in the fighting since Sunday. The UN has documented killings by government-affiliated armed men, while residents feel abandoned amid the escalating violence.</p>

Shapps argued that the use of a super-injunction to block reporting was justified to prevent the list from being disseminated, which could have led to individuals being pursued and killed.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition affecting blood flow in the legs. The diagnosis was made after the president noticed swelling in his legs. According to his physician, the condition is benign and occurs when veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing it to pool in the lower limbs. The doctor's note confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and stated that the president remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is set to sign winger Bryan Mbeumo after Brentford accepted a £65 million bid for the Cameroon international. The deal, which could rise to £70 million with add-ons, will make the 25-year-old Brentford's biggest-ever sale. Mbeumo is expected to become United's third major signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon. The versatile forward, who can play centrally or on the wing, is valued for his proven Premier League experience, work rate, and goal-scoring ability, fitting into new manager Ruben Amorim's system.</p>

The author reflects on personal experiences with prejudice and connects them to the political tactics used against Mamdani, such as altering his appearance in ads and making baseless accusations. The article posits that while personal prejudice exists everywhere, institutional power amplifies it into structural racism. Mamdani's visibility and success, the author suggests, offer a new source of information to challenge old, harmful stereotypes.</p>

His lawyers state the government alleges he provided material support to a "Tier III" terrorist organization, a claim they call illogical and a pretext for targeting him. The detention has sparked fear and anger in the community, with supporters rallying against what they see as an arbitrary and unjust action.</p>
