          <p>Republicans in Congress have revoked California's authority to set its own electric vehicle mandates, viewing it as a check on the state's influence. Representative Morgan Griffith argues that California has more rights than other states, while Senator John Barrasso believes electric vehicles are impractical for rural states like Wyoming. Republicans also express ideological concerns, suggesting California's policies represent a broader liberal agenda. California's stringent pollution limits have historically driven innovation and cleaner vehicles nationwide, but face opposition from states reliant on the fossil fuel industry, who are pushing back against what they view as California's overreach.</p>

Trump criticized the Biden Department of Justice and the judge in the case, claiming Jenkins was unfairly persecuted. Jenkins was convicted for accepting over $75,000 in cash payments for appointing businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The Department of Justice stated that Jenkins had violated his oath of office, but Trump defended him as a wonderful person.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for a swift end to the war in Gaza, signaling a shift from his earlier unwavering support for Israel. This intervention comes as Germany and Italy have also voiced strong criticism of Israel's expanded attacks and the suffering inflicted on civilians.

          <p>While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market. The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the "true rate" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period. LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.

However, Trump has not joined European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or offering additional aid to Ukraine. This pattern reflects a strategic void, where Trump criticizes Russia's violence but avoids taking actions that would impose a cost on Putin.

The delay, agreed upon after a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a six-week window for negotiations.

          <p>The Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to address his recent struggles, particularly his tendency to leave mistake pitches in the middle of the zone. Despite having good stuff, Scott has blown several saves due to hitters capitalizing on these mistakes. The Dodgers' coaching staff is encouraging Scott to aim for more chase outside the zone, even if it means issuing more walks. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the team.</p>

          <p>A Knoxville family lost $1,800 and a place to live after falling victim to a 'self-showing' rental scam on Facebook Marketplace. The family found a listing for a home within their budget and contacted the landlord, who provided a lockbox code for a self-viewing. After paying move-in fees, the family moved in, only to receive a notice from the realty company that they were illegally residing at the property. The actual realty company is providing the family with a week-long stay at an extended stay hotel.</p>
