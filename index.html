        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum, raising them to 50%, has taken effect. This action coincides with President Trump's push for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a sweeping immigration and tax bill. The bill is facing opposition from GOP members concerned about the national debt and Medicaid changes, as well as criticism from Elon Musk, who has labeled it an "abomination." The tariffs and the proposed bill highlight ongoing tensions within the Republican party and between the administration and key industry figures. The implications of these policies on the economy and trade relations remain to be seen. Optimism about the situation is low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ADP's May report revealed that private sector job creation has slowed significantly, reaching its lowest point in over two years with only 37,000 jobs added. This figure is substantially below the expected 110,000 and the revised 60,000 from April, signaling a potential weakening in the labor market. The report precedes the Bureau of Labor Statistics' nonfarm payrolls count, which is anticipated to show a gain of 125,000 jobs with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.2%. President Trump responded to the report by urging the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, citing similar actions taken in Europe. This report suggests a cooling labor market and intensifies the pressure on the Federal Reserve to adjust its monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that mortgage rates are unlikely to decrease immediately following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than direct Fed policy changes, and the 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering between 4.5% and 5%. Factors such as persistent inflation above the Fed's 2% target and a robust job market are not creating pressure for the Fed to cut rates. Despite this, some experts suggest that buying a home now could be advantageous due to less competition and the potential for negotiating better deals with sellers. Refinancing remains an option if rates decrease later, and home prices are expected to continue rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has temporarily suspended its operations in Gaza, citing a need for "update, organization, and efficiency improvement work." Reuters reports that the pause is to address security concerns following reports of numerous Palestinian deaths near GHF distribution hubs. The UN and other aid agencies have refused to collaborate with the GHF, accusing it of weaponizing access to food, while the Israeli military denies accusations of shooting at civilians. The GHF has also faced scrutiny over its funding, operational details, and compliance with Swiss regulations.

          <p>Representative Chip Roy is advocating for legislation that would grant Congress greater authority over federal spending, inspired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The proposed bill would provide lawmakers with real-time access to Treasury Department invoices exceeding $25,000, as well as data on payments to federal benefit recipients and employees. Roy asserts that this legislation would enable Congress to identify and address wasteful spending, continuing the mission of DOGE. This initiative follows Musk's departure from his government role and his criticism of congressional spending measures.

          <p>President Donald Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell following the release of a weak ADP jobs report. Trump stated that Powell must lower interest rates, accusing him of being "unbelievable."

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates, claiming that it puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage compared to other countries.

Foscarinis contends that homelessness is a policy failure, not a personal one, and criticizes bipartisan policies that have contributed to the problem.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates are constantly changing, fluctuating daily and even hourly based on market conditions, with Wednesdays and Fridays seeing the most volatility. These fluctuations can impact homebuyers, as rates can change between application and finding a house. The Federal Reserve influences mortgage rates indirectly through the 10-year Treasury note, which mortgage rates closely track. Other factors influencing rates include overall economic conditions, financial markets, inflation, and the Fed's interest rate moves. Individual rates are also affected by credit score, down payment, loan term, and loan type, with rate locks providing a way to secure a rate for a set period.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is driven by a fear of failure, which serves as a major motivator for his success, according to his biographer Stephen Witt. Huang's anxiety about the company's potential implosion pushes him to work harder and achieve more. Witt notes that Huang's motivation stems from negative emotions such as fear, paranoia, and guilt. Other CEOs are typically more upbeat, but Huang's constant self-criticism and discomfort with success contribute to his drive.</p>
