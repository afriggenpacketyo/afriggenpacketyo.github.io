          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the influential frontman of Black Sabbath and a celebrated solo artist, has passed away at the age of 76. His family announced his death, stating he was surrounded by loved ones. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne co-founded the band that pioneered heavy metal and later found new fame with his family on the reality show "The Osbournes." His death follows a long and public battle with Parkinson's disease and other health issues, which had recently forced him to retire from touring.</p>

          <p>Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has passed a bill that imposes fines on citizens for searching or accessing online content deemed "extremist" by the government. The list of banned materials is extensive, including items like Ukrainian songs and posts by the band Pussy Riot, with fines reaching up to 5,000 rubles. The legislation has drawn criticism from both opposition figures, who liken it to Orwell's "1984," and some pro-government voices, raising concerns about its practical implementation and impact on civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a £63.5 million deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon. Negotiations over the final details, particularly add-on payments, have slightly delayed the official announcement. Gyokeres, who has already agreed to a five-year contract, is set to bolster Arsenal's attack after an impressive season where he scored 54 goals in 52 games. The move follows manager Mikel Arteta's extensive search for an elite center-forward to strengthen the team's offensive capabilities.</p>

While recently allowing the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems to aid Ukrainian defense, he also gave Russia a 50-day period before considering new sanctions, effectively allowing Moscow's bombing campaign to continue unabated for the summer. This approach appears to provide Ukraine with just enough support to continue its defense but not enough to achieve a decisive victory.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Los Angeles International Airport seized nearly 300 pounds of methamphetamine cleverly concealed within a shipment of solar panels. The shipment, which originated in Mexico, was destined for New Zealand before being flagged and inspected by officers. This seizure is the latest in a series of creative smuggling attempts intercepted at LAX, including drugs disguised as dog shampoo. No arrests have been made yet in connection with the significant drug bust, and an investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>An initial investigation into the fatal Jeju Air crash in South Korea suggests pilot error may have been a key factor, a finding that has drawn strong protests from victims' families and pilots. The report indicates that after both engines sustained bird strikes, the pilots shut down the less-damaged engine before the crash landing. This implication of human error has led to accusations that authorities are trying to shift blame onto the deceased pilots. The families are demanding more transparency and the release of the full cockpit voice recorder data.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man from Essex, Howard Phillips, has been found guilty of attempting to provide information to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents. Phillips offered to pass on personal details about the former UK defence secretary, Sir Grant Shapps. The "agents" he was communicating with were, in fact, undercover British officers. Phillips, who reportedly dreamed of being a spy, was convicted under the National Security Act after offering his "100% loyalty and dedication" to a foreign power in exchange for payment.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the percentage of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report shows 27% of Americans have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure that drove many to seek extra work. This shift may suggest that Americans are feeling less financial anxiety than in the immediate post-pandemic years. (not investment advice)</p>

The measure, championed by Mayor Daniel Lurie as a way to clean up streets, targets hundreds of RVs that serve as homes for those who cannot afford housing. While the city is offering a permit program and financial assistance for some current RV residents to find housing, critics argue the plan is cruel.

While CBS cited financial reasons, the timing, just days after host Stephen Colbert criticized the network's parent company over a settlement with Donald Trump, has fueled speculation. Colbert's show was a leading critical voice against the Trump administration, and its removal is viewed by some as a loss of a valuable platform for institutional critique, regardless of the show's ratings or ad revenue challenges.</p>

          <p>Two years into the war in Gaza, there is growing evidence that Israel has committed war crimes, including the starvation of civilians and disproportionate destruction, according to a BBC analysis. This has led to increasing international condemnation and isolation, with even key allies like the U.S. reportedly losing patience with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, and a case at the International Court of Justice alleges genocide. This diplomatic pressure is mounting as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaches new depths.</p>
