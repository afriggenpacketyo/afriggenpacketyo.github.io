            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages, sent on March 15, included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This follows a previous incident where Hegseth inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief in a similar Signal chat, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. The Defense Department maintains that no classified information was shared. (Fox News was not the source for this article.)</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year at 3.6%. This decision comes as China focuses on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The PBOC's move follows better-than-expected economic data, including a first-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%, providing room for the central bank to maintain steady rates. The Chinese onshore yuan was trading flat following the announcement.</p>

            <p>Shanghai welcomed a record 220,000 spectators for the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, which is projected to bring over 5 billion yuan in economic benefits to the city. Local-level policymakers are increasingly turning to the sports industry to stimulate consumption and drive growth amid a challenging economic landscape. With the central government supporting the industry, local authorities are betting on the sports sector as traditional growth drivers, like real estate, decline. This shift highlights a strategic move to integrate sports with other fields for broader economic development.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for a Chinese airline has been returned to Boeing's U.S. production hub due to tariffs imposed by both the U.S. and China. The jet, meant for Xiamen Airlines, landed back in Seattle after China retaliated against increased U.S. tariffs. The tariffs make the delivery of a new 737 MAX, valued at around $55 million, financially crippling for the Chinese airline. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airlines considering deferring deliveries rather than paying duties.</p>

These unions often provide social security benefits and alleviate societal pressure, particularly for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such arrangements in the past decade, reflecting a shift towards valuing companionship and shared life goals over romantic or sexual attraction. While same-sex marriage remains unrecognized in Japan, friendship marriages offer a socially acceptable alternative for those seeking partnership outside traditional norms.</p>

Childcare deserts persist, particularly in deprived areas, and private nurseries struggle with rising operating costs. The eligibility criteria for the funded hours exclude some working families, leading to concerns about widening inequality in access to early education. The government is investing in the system, but questions remain about its ability to meet the growing demand and ensure equitable access for all children.</p>

            <p>India's roads are among the deadliest in the world, with over 172,000 fatalities in 2023, averaging nearly one death every three minutes. The crisis is attributed to factors including over-speeding, lack of safety precautions (such as helmets and seatbelts), overloading, driving without a valid license, and poor road design. Experts emphasize the need for improved infrastructure, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, and a shift in human behavior to address this persistent problem. Road crashes cost India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>
