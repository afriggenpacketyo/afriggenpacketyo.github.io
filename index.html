        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under its new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from traditional environmental advocacy to a more confrontational "eco-populist" approach. The party aims to capitalize on recent membership growth by "picking fights" to gain media attention and appeal to voters disillusioned with mainstream politics. This change involves adopting bolder messaging and a willingness to provoke controversy, mirroring tactics used by parties like Reform UK. However, some members worry this new direction could alienate the rural and moderate voters who were key to their previous electoral successes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>School districts are increasingly adopting policies that restrict student cellphone use throughout the entire school day to combat classroom distractions and improve social interaction. At Jericho High School in New York, students and teachers report that the ban has led to more engaging class discussions and a livelier cafeteria atmosphere. While some parents and students initially expressed concerns about safety and separation anxiety, many now acknowledge the benefits, such as being more present and forming stronger real-world connections with peers. The policy reflects a broader trend among educators to address the negative impacts of constant connectivity on learning environments.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the current negotiations represent the closest point yet to securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. He emphasized that the peace plan proposed by President Trump requires swift finalization of logistical details, cautioning that there are still many potential pitfalls. A U.S. delegation, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is heading to Cairo to participate in talks with Israeli and Hamas mediators. The administration hopes that the core components of the deal can be quickly agreed upon to build momentum for a broader resolution.</p>

          <p>At President Trump's request, the Securities and Exchange Commission is developing a proposal that could allow public companies to file financial reports semi-annually instead of quarterly. Proponents argue this change would save companies significant time and money, encouraging more private firms to go public. However, the move could severely impact the revenue of major accounting firms, which earn substantial fees from quarterly reviews. Critics, including the accounting industry, warn that less frequent reporting could reduce market transparency and investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge identifies her number one non-negotiable rule for parents as prohibiting any electronic devices in a child's bedroom during sleeping hours. She argues this simple, no-cost measure is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for adolescent brain development, emotional regulation, and overall mental health. Research shows that overnight device access is linked to insufficient sleep and higher rates of anxiety and depression in teens. Twenge advises parents to be firm in implementing this rule, even with older children, by explaining its importance for their well-being.</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Highlight Overlooked Sepsis Symptoms in Children Amid Millions of Annual Deaths</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sepsis is a leading cause of death in children globally, yet its early symptoms are often subtle and easily mistaken for common viral infections. Medical professionals warn that signs like abnormal temperature, confusion, or extreme illness require immediate attention, as early treatment with antibiotics is critical for survival. Professor Elliot Long of the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute emphasizes that doctors must listen closely to parents who report their child seems sicker than ever before. This parental intuition can be a key red flag for a condition that becomes much harder to treat in its later, more obvious stages.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that most Americans do not believe the positions of either the Republican or Democratic parties are worth causing a government shutdown, with widespread concern over its potential economic impact. The poll shows low approval ratings for President Trump, congressional Democrats, and Republicans regarding their handling of the situation. While Republicans are more often described as "extreme," Democrats are seen as "weak." This widespread dissatisfaction suggests the public views the shutdown as a political failure that distracts from more pressing national issues like inflation.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill signed by President Trump introduces major benefits for small businesses, aiming to stimulate Main Street economies. Key provisions include the ability to deduct 100% of the cost of new equipment purchases and the restoration of immediate expensing for domestic research and development costs. The legislation also revives a more generous calculation for deducting business interest and makes the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent. Tax experts view these changes as a significant boon for small companies, providing opportunities to reduce their tax burden and reinvest in growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union should shift its focus from the trade dispute over Chinese electric vehicles to the more immediate threat of expanded U.S. tariffs. The U.S. has recently added hundreds of new items, including components for transport and energy, to its steel and aluminum tariff list, which could significantly harm European suppliers. The author suggests that Brussels should seek a compromise with Beijing on the EV issue to free up political capital.

          <h2>Recent Tax Law Changes May Alter Strategies for Year-End Charitable Donations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tax legislation could impact how Americans approach their year-end charitable giving. A key change set for 2026 will introduce a new tax deduction for non-itemizers, which may incentivize some donors who take the standard deduction to delay smaller gifts until the new year. Conversely, other provisions taking effect in 2026 will reduce the tax benefit of charitable deductions for some high-income earners. This could encourage those filers to accelerate their giving or use tools like donor-advised funds to "bunch" multiple years of donations into 2025 to maximize their tax break.

The operation, which also marked the world's first coordinated mission involving both crewed and uncrewed submersibles in the region, was conducted from the research ship Shenhai 1. Researchers used the Jiaolong manned submersible to collect hundreds of deep-sea samples and gather critical data on biodiversity, sea ice conditions, and ocean chemistry. This achievement represents a significant advancement in China's polar research capabilities and its growing presence in the Arctic.</p>

The attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram people outside before attempting to force his way into the building with a knife; he was shot and killed by police. One of the deceased victims was hit by police gunfire during the response, and another person was also wounded by a police bullet. The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was on bail for an alleged sexual assault at the time of the attack, which police believe was motivated by Islamist extremism.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece proposes that a coalition of blue states should declare a national emergency and form an interstate compact to create their own political and social framework. This body would establish a declaration of rights and obligations, such as access to healthcare and social security, and create mandates for funding these programs among participating states. The author suggests this act of "political theatre" would serve as a powerful form of resistance to the Trump administration. It would also create a prototype for a new, more progressive form of American governance, shifting the political focus away from the current administration's actions.</p>

Despite still playing at a high level, Kopitar is firm in his choice to retire on his own terms.

By selecting genetic material from coral that show resistance to heat and disease, they aim to cultivate hardier reefs capable of surviving in warming waters.

This article argues that the administration's hostility towards renewables is causing the U.S. to fall behind global competitors like China in the clean energy race.

This steep challenge in the Senate places even greater importance on the battle for the House of Representatives.
