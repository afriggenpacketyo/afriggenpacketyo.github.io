          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% drop following a first-quarter earnings report that fell short of estimates. The company cited "production fluctuations" leading to lower average selling prices as the reason for missing revenue and net income targets. While wafer shipments increased, SMIC forecasts a sequential revenue decline for the current quarter. The company attributed the growth in wafer shipments to customer demand influenced by geopolitical changes and government policies, with capacity utilization reaching 89.6%.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible reduction in U.S. tariffs on goods from China as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. This development signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war that has impacted financial markets. While acknowledging the meeting's friendly nature, Trump emphasized the need for an elegant resolution. Despite the positive signals, analysts caution that systemic frictions between the U.S. and China remain, and any initial tariff cuts are likely to be minor, with significant issues still needing resolution.</p>

          <p>New soil testing conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has revealed high levels of lead and other toxic metals in properties previously cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after recent wildfires.

The county health department is now recommending that property owners consider soil contamination assessments before rebuilding.

Weinstein denies the allegations, and the current charges relate to a separate incident four years later where he allegedly forced her to perform oral sex. Sokola's testimony is part of the retrial following the overturning of Weinstein's previous conviction, with her claims being a major driver for the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports rose by 8.1% year-on-year, while imports decreased slightly. Shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, but exports to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%. Analysts suggest that transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts may have contributed to the surge. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market, potentially exacerbating deflationary pressures.</p>

The author suggests a "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, as a potential resolution to tensions within NATO, ensuring U.S. interests while moderating concerns among international partners.

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, defying expectations despite increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump. The growth potentially strengthens China's position in upcoming trade talks with the U.S. in Switzerland. Some analysts attribute the export growth to transshipment through other countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Despite the resilience, expectations are that trade data will weaken in the coming months, emphasizing the need for a trade agreement between China and the U.S.</p>

American carmakers expressed concerns about the deal making UK-made cars less expensive than models made in Mexico and Canada.
