          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has made an unexpected $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome web browser, a move that comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny. In a letter to Google's parent company, Alphabet, Perplexity argued that an independent operator would enhance user safety and choice. The offer is timed as a federal judge considers ordering Google to divest its search business, though analysts suggest the bid is far below Chrome's estimated value. Perplexity, which recently launched its own AI-powered browser, stated it would maintain Google as the default search engine and continue supporting the open-source Chromium platform.</p>

          <p>Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss potential pathways to ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting was announced by Trump following a deadline he set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face additional sanctions. The location in Alaska, once a Russian territory, holds historical significance and will be hosted at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise" for Trump, who aims to urge Putin to end the conflict, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend in person.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and federal law enforcement agents have been deployed in Washington D.C. after President Trump assumed control of the city's police force, citing uncontrolled violent crime. Armored vehicles have been positioned at key locations, with an expected force of 800 Guard troops and 500 federal agents. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has strongly criticized the move as an "authoritarian push," while also stating her intent to cooperate with federal officers to enhance safety. The White House reported that 23 arrests were made on the first night for various offenses, signaling a sustained crackdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of science research grants for UCLA that were abruptly suspended. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin found that the suspension of National Science Foundation (NSF) grants violated a previous injunction against such terminations. The administration had frozen $584 million in federal funding, citing allegations of antisemitism and discriminatory admissions at the university. This case represents the first legal challenge to the mass grant suspensions at UCLA, although the order currently only applies to NSF grants and not those from other federal agencies.</p>

          <p>As part of President Trump's initiative to combat crime in Washington D.C., National Guard troops have been stationed around the National Mall. An Army spokesperson confirmed the troops are tasked with providing logistics support and maintaining a visible presence to assist local law enforcement. While the deployment is legal for protecting federal property, the necessity of their presence in the relatively safe, tourist-heavy National Mall area has been questioned. The troops, who are not involved in direct law enforcement functions, are expected to have access to weapons but will not carry them as part of their current duties.</p>

One such detainee, a father of three U.S. citizens, was arrested after a traffic stop despite having an active DACA status. An ICE official maintained that all detainees had committed a crime by entering the country illegally, although this is a civil violation, raising concerns among immigration advocates.</p>

          <p>A new annual report from the Trump administration's State Department asserts that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has deteriorated over the past year. The document specifically cites concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. It points to the government's response to the Southport attacks and the implementation of buffer zones around abortion clinics as examples of government censorship and chilled speech. A UK government spokesperson responded by stating that free speech is vital and that the country is proud to uphold freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Rapper and popular YouTuber DDG was briefly detained by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what appears to have been a 'swatting' incident. DDG stated that law enforcement surrounded him at a paintball tournament, drew their weapons, and detained him without immediate explanation. 'Swatting' involves making a false report of a serious crime to provoke a large, aggressive police response. While in the sheriff's vehicle, DDG said he saw information on a laptop suggesting someone had falsely reported he was armed and planning to harm people, prompting him to tell deputies he was likely a victim of the dangerous prank.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of 800 National Guard members to Washington D.C. operates under a unique legal framework due to the city's federal status. Unlike in states, the D.C. National Guard is under the president's direct authority. The troops were activated under Title 32, which allows them to support law enforcement and make arrests, though officials state their current mission is focused on support roles. This status exempts them from the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The president has also temporarily taken control of the D.C. police force under the Home Rule Act, citing an emergency.</p>

However, progress has been minimal for some of the deadliest cancers, including those affecting the pancreas, esophagus, stomach, and lungs, which still have survival rates below 20%.

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted a weeklong "boil water" notice for the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch neighborhoods, declaring the water safe to drink. The advisory affected approximately 9,200 households after a faulty, decades-old underground valve impeded water flow, causing service outages. After repairing the issue and restoring flow, the agency conducted tests to ensure safety. The DWP is now urging residents to thoroughly flush all pipes and water-using appliances to clear out any stagnant water or sediment before consumption and is offering a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the West African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. The admission came in a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, following a historical report commissioned by France. The report detailed how French colonial forces engaged in mass displacement, operated internment camps, and supported brutal militias, actions that continued even after Cameroon's independence in 1960. Macron stated it was his duty to accept France's role in these events, which he said cost "tens of thousands of lives," as part of a broader effort to confront the country's colonial past.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of burglarizing actor Brad Pitt's home and targeting other high-profile individuals, including actors and professional athletes. The suspects, who are allegedly street gang members, were identified after a trio of masked thieves raided Pitt's Los Feliz home in late June while the actor was away. Police stated that property stolen during the burglaries was recovered from the suspects' homes. Authorities noted that criminals are becoming more sophisticated, using surveillance and Wi-Fi jammers, and often target celebrities whose travel schedules are public, making their homes vulnerable.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. With the EU sidelined from the direct talks about the war in Ukraine, leaders expressed concern that a peace deal could be outlined without their input. They emphasized that a just peace must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that its borders cannot be changed by force. The appeal comes amid fears that any concessions to Putin could embolden further aggression and as Trump has suggested Ukraine may need to accept land swaps to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk of infections from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new areas. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood, can cause rapidly spreading infections that are fatal in one in five cases. While common in warm waters like the Gulf of Mexico, cases are now being reported further north in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. The danger is particularly heightened during hurricane season, which can spread contaminated water, highlighting another public health threat exacerbated by climate change.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets rallied, with the S&P 500 approaching a record high, following the release of better-than-expected inflation data. The July report showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year, below economists' forecasts and bolstering investor hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs and stimulate the economy, a move long advocated for by President Trump. While the data was positive, some economists remain cautious, pointing to underlying inflation metrics and the potential future impact of tariffs on consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California peach farmers are facing a difficult season with harvests down by as much as 30% due to warmer winter temperatures. Stone fruit trees, including peaches, require a certain number of "chill hours" below 45 degrees to properly regulate their growth and produce a full crop. This past winter's inconsistent cold disrupted the trees' cycles, leading to significantly lower yields and, in some cases, no crop at all for some growers. The shortage is beginning to impact consumers, who are seeing higher prices for peaches, highlighting how climate change directly threatens both agricultural livelihoods and the food supply.</p>
