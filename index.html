          <p>The U.S. government has deported eight men, originally from Asia and Latin America, to South Sudan following a prolonged legal battle. These men, convicted of serious crimes in the United States, were sent to the conflict-ridden African nation, a country none of them are from. Human rights advocates expressed alarm, arguing the deportation is unconstitutional and punitive, potentially exposing the men to danger in a country the State Department warns against visiting. The administration views the action as a victory for national security and its broader immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Following a collision between a passenger train and a freight train in Jinhua, China, passengers were left trapped inside without air conditioning for over two hours on a hot day. One man, unable to bear the heat, smashed a window to allow fresh air into the carriage. While his actions provided relief, he was subsequently detained and reprimanded by the police for damaging the train. The incident highlights the difficult conditions passengers faced during the unexpected and lengthy delay.</p>

          <p>According to fitness experts and research, exercising in the morning, specifically between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., may be linked to a lower risk of obesity and a smaller waist size. The article highlights that morning workouts can release beneficial chemicals like endorphins and dopamine, setting a positive tone for the day. However, experts stress that these benefits are contingent on getting adequate sleep, typically seven to eight hours. Prioritizing sleep over an early workout is recommended if one is sleep-deprived, as rest is crucial for muscle recovery and overall progress.</p>

          <p>Oscar Black, a 15-year-old from Lurgan, has made history by becoming the youngest person to complete a solo swim of the North Channel from Northern Ireland to Scotland. He completed the grueling swim, which covered 46km due to strong currents, in 16 hours and 38 minutes. During the journey, he battled numerous jellyfish stings and difficult currents that tested his mental and physical endurance. Despite the challenges, Black persevered to set the new record, describing the accomplishment as "all worth it in the end."</p>

          <p>Amid a national trend towards more punitive approaches, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction to tackle its intertwined homelessness and addiction crises. A new Skid Row Care Campus offers a range of services, from housing and treatment to clean syringes and drug-testing strips for those not ready to quit. This approach aims to save lives, prevent the spread of disease, and build trust to eventually guide individuals toward recovery, without requiring abstinence as a prerequisite for help. The policy stands in contrast to calls for more forceful, treatment-mandated interventions, highlighting a major philosophical divide in how to address the issue.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to formalize new tariff rates for numerous countries, ending a 90-day period of uncertainty. President Trump has favored a highly unorthodox approach, using the threat of steep tariffs to pressure nations into bilateral trade deals. Economists note that tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importing companies, with costs often passed to consumers, contrary to the framing that foreign countries pay them. A recent deal with Vietnam, for example, sets a 20% tariff rate, significantly higher than the pre-Trump average of 3%, suggesting increased prices for American consumers on many goods.

While critics raise concerns about chemical processing and high omega-6 content promoting inflammation, researchers say this doesn't typically play out in the human body.

While the original protests had clear political leaders, today's movement is seen as a more grassroots, leaderless effort unified by technology.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This announcement came as the BRICS summit of developing nations was underway, where leaders issued a statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. The president did not specify which policies he considered "anti-American," creating further uncertainty in global trade relations. This new threat escalates his administration's use of tariffs as a tool of foreign policy and economic pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The owners of a pet lion in Lahore, Pakistan, have been arrested after the animal escaped from a farmhouse and attacked a woman and two young children. Security footage showed the lion leaping a wall and pouncing on the woman before being chased away, after which it attacked the children. The victims were hospitalized but are in stable condition. Police reported that the owners, who did not have a license to keep the lion, recaptured the animal and attempted to hide. The incident has prompted a province-wide crackdown on the illegal ownership of wild animals as pets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unexpected move, Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Transport Minister Roman Starovoit after just over a year in the position. The dismissal comes as Russia's transport sector faces significant hurdles, including a shortage of aviation parts and financial strain on its railway system due to high interest rates. No official reason was given for the firing, but industry sources suggest it may be linked to corruption scandals in the Kursk region, where Starovoit previously served as governor. Andrei Nikitin, a former regional governor, has been appointed as the acting transport minister.</p>

In Chatham County, North Carolina, the Haw River surged dramatically, nearing a record crest and causing over 100 roads to flood and one to collapse.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The flavor profile of chocolate varies significantly around the world, with American chocolate often tasting distinct to European palates. This difference is partly due to the use of butyric acid in some U.S. brands, which imparts a slightly sour note, and a higher sugar content to ensure a long shelf life. In contrast, European chocolate, particularly from Switzerland and Belgium, is strictly regulated to have a higher cocoa content and prioritizes a fine, creamy texture through traditional methods. The article also notes the rise of new chocolate markets in India and Africa, each with its own unique preferences and production styles.</p>

The jet was diverted to Thiruvananthapuram airport on June 14 due to bad weather and subsequently reported a technical issue, preventing its return to the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier. The prolonged stay of the $110 million stealth jet on Indian soil has sparked public curiosity. If the specialist team cannot make the aircraft flight-worthy, it will need to be dismantled for transport.</p>

While this secures the C919's short-term future and aids its ambitions in the European market, analysts suggest that the previous U.S. restrictions have likely strengthened Beijing's resolve to accelerate its own domestic engine development programs.

          <p>After a nine-week trial that captivated Australia, Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three relatives with a poisoned Beef Wellington. The prosecution built its case around evidence suggesting she deliberately foraged for deadly death cap mushrooms and lured her victims to the fatal lunch with a fabricated story about having cancer. Key evidence included her disposal of a food dehydrator containing mushroom traces, conflicting stories about the mushroom source, and her lack of severe symptoms. The defense argued it was a tragic accident compounded by panic-induced lies, but the jury ultimately accepted the prosecution's narrative of a calculated triple murder.</p>

          <p>As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington to meet with President Trump, there are growing but cautious hopes for a new ceasefire in Gaza. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed in Qatar over a U.S.-sponsored proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. However, significant obstacles remain, primarily Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the war, which Israel has consistently rejected. The recent Israel-Iran conflict is seen as having shifted regional dynamics, potentially creating more favorable conditions for an agreement to end the 21-month-long war.</p>
