          <p>In Java, Indonesia, a multi-story Islamic boarding school collapsed during illegal construction, trapping more than 90 students under the rubble. The structure fell as male students, aged 12 to 18, were gathered for afternoon prayers; female students were in a different hall and escaped. Over 300 rescue workers are engaged in a desperate search for survivors, complicated by unstable debris. The incident has resulted in at least three confirmed deaths and 100 injuries, with officials expecting the casualty count to increase as the rescue operation continues.</p>

The former Chelsea manager expressed her enjoyment of the transition to international coaching, comparing it to being a grandparent due to the limited time spent with players. Hayes, who led the US to an Olympic gold medal shortly after taking the role, noted that the position allows her to apply more strategic, long-term thinking, a change she was ready for after a highly successful club career.</p>

          <p>A significant sunscreen scandal in Australia has intensified, with 18 products now recalled over concerns they do not provide their claimed level of sun protection. An investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) found that some products labeled SPF 50+ may offer an SPF rating as low as four. The issue stems from a shared base formula and raises serious questions about the testing practices of a U.S.-based lab, Princeton Consumer Research Corp. This is particularly alarming for Australia, which has the world's highest rate of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines, resulting in at least 69 fatalities and trapping numerous people in collapsed buildings. The city of Bogo in Cebu province was hit hardest, with rescue operations hampered by damaged infrastructure and intermittent rain. The quake, which originated from a shallow undersea fault, prompted a temporary tsunami warning. This disaster compounds the region's recent struggles, as it was still recovering from a tropical storm that had caused widespread damage and dozens of deaths just days earlier.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has initiated a shutdown after lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill, primarily due to a partisan dispute over healthcare funding. This is the first such shutdown in nearly seven years, resulting in the furlough of approximately 800,000 federal workers and the suspension of many non-essential government services. While critical functions like law enforcement and air traffic control will continue, the economic impact is projected to reduce GDP by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points for each week the shutdown persists.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced his intention to change how international laws, particularly Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are interpreted in UK asylum cases. The goal is to prevent unsuccessful asylum seekers and foreign criminals from blocking deportation by claiming they would face inferior prison or healthcare systems in their home countries. Starmer clarified that he does not want to dismantle human rights laws but believes their application must be updated to address modern mass migration challenges while still protecting genuine refugees.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, signaling significant financial growth in the sport, particularly in England's WSL and the US's NWSL. While rising fees indicate a healthier economic ecosystem, experts warn it is also widening the competitive and financial gap between the top leagues and others, like Germany's Bundesliga. This rapid commercialization is driven by increased visibility and broadcast deals, but it risks creating a permanent elite tier of clubs that smaller leagues cannot compete with, mirroring trends in the men's game.</p>

          <p>A new framework agreement proposed by Donald Trump to end the war in Gaza has gained significant momentum, backed by key Arab nations and conditionally accepted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the plan's primary weakness is its lack of specific details, a common feature of Trump's diplomatic efforts. While it vaguely mentions a pathway to a Palestinian state, Netanyahu has already publicly reiterated his opposition to the idea, creating conflicting interpretations of the plan's ultimate goals and casting doubt on its long-term viability.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mohammed Abu Mughaisib, a Médecins Sans Frontières medic recently evacuated from Gaza, described how he and his colleagues were starving while trying to save lives. He detailed a collapsed healthcare system where injured patients lie on the floor, and doctors, subsisting on glucose solution, wait for one patient to die to admit another to the ICU. After two years of working in war-torn hospitals and being repeatedly displaced, he made the difficult decision to leave, highlighting the unbearable physical and moral toll on medical staff remaining in the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>Qian Zhang, a highly educated professional who came to the U.S. from China, has left the country for Portugal after more than a decade on an H-1B work visa. Despite a successful career, she described the constant anxiety of her life being tied to her employer and the fear that losing her job would mean immediate deportation. Her story reflects a growing disillusionment among skilled foreign workers who feel vulnerable and unwelcome in the U.S. amid shifting immigration policies, prompting some to seek opportunities in countries with more accommodating visa processes.</p>

          <p>A civilian employee of the U.S. Navy has been charged after allegedly fabricating an active shooter threat at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, triggering a base-wide lockdown. The employee, Malika Brittingham, admitted to investigators that she carried out the hoax because she felt ostracized by her colleagues. According to the criminal complaint, she hoped that sharing the traumatic experience would help her "trauma bond" with them.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its homepage blaming the "Radical Left" for the government shutdown, a move that an ethics watchdog group has called a "blatant violation" of the Hatch Act. The advocacy group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, arguing that the highly partisan message used taxpayer resources to campaign against Democrats. The Hatch Act restricts the political activities of federal employees to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan manner.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers began their postseason campaign with a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in Game 1 of the wild-card series. The offense was explosive, matching a franchise playoff record with five home runs, including two each from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues surfaced late in the game, as three relievers struggled in the eighth inning, allowing three runs and turning a blowout into a tense situation. The performance highlighted both the Dodgers' championship potential and their most significant vulnerability.</p>

A more significant issue could arise for homebuyers in high-risk areas who require flood insurance, as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot issue new policies during a shutdown, potentially complicating or delaying closings.</p>

Professions like electricians and plumbers are seen as more secure from automation, and the stigma associated with blue-collar work is diminishing.

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to significantly impact U.S. air travel, a prolonged stalemate could lead to major disruptions. Most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential and must work without pay, but extended financial strain could lead to increased sick calls, as seen in the 2018-2019 shutdown. This could cause staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and security screeners, resulting in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations. The travel industry warns a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Before 1980, funding gaps did not typically halt agency operations, but legal opinions from that era established that agencies cannot run without congressionally approved funding. Since then, there have been numerous shutdowns, including eight under President Reagan and a 34-day partial shutdown under President Trump in 2018. These events are often driven by intense partisan standoffs over budget priorities and policy issues.</p>
