          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with the investigation by counter-terrorism officers into a fire at Prime Minister Keir Starmer's home. The Daily Telegraph reports police are investigating whether an arson attack at a second home linked to Starmer is related. The Daily Express focuses on Starmer's new immigration policy, questioning its effectiveness. The Guardian highlights the backlash from MPs who say Starmer's comments echo far-right rhetoric, while The Times includes a picture of migrants picked up in Dover. The Financial Times leads with the US and China agreeing to slash tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days.</p>

          <p>Former professional cricketer Arul Suppiah discusses his struggles with anorexia, a serious mental health condition often associated with young women. Suppiah's health kick in 2017 spiraled into an eating disorder, leading to excessive exercise and avoidance of social situations involving food. Advised by his doctor to take time off, Suppiah faced a warning from his psychiatrist about potential hospitalization under the Mental Health Act if he didn't improve. He has since been working to turn things around.</p>

          <p>A recent Japanese government survey indicates that approximately half of respondents believed at least one instance of false information on social media after encountering it. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications emphasizes the need to improve media literacy, as people are easily misled by unsourced online information. One in four who encountered false information shared it with family, friends, or on social media. The survey highlights the importance of critical thinking and verifying information before dissemination.</p>

However, these rates do not include previous tariffs held over from the first iteration of the trade war.

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting the Supreme Court's permission to deport nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas. The administration claims that 176 of the migrants are alleged members of Tren de Aragua and pose a danger. The solicitor general argues that SCOTUS should not block the removal of detainees who have been endangering others. The filing also states that the migrants have received adequate notice and the opportunity to pursue habeas petitions.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article discusses how German companies are reconsidering their investments in the United States due to tariffs. Despite investing more than three times as much in the U.S. as American companies do in Germany, German manufacturers are pulling back from investing in the U.S. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry notes a decline in sentiment among German companies with U.S. factories since President Trump announced the initial round of tariffs. German companies are more willing to invest at home, given the new government's mandate to reduce bureaucracy and lower energy prices.</p>
