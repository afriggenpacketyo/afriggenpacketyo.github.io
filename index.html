          <p>French utility group Suez, backed by BlackRock, is evaluating its water-infrastructure assets in China and has enlisted HSBC Holdings to explore potential streamlining strategies for its global operations. The review may lead to a sale of the Chinese water business, potentially valued at over $1 billion, attracting interest from Chinese firms and infrastructure funds. Suez entered the Chinese market in 1975 and has since expanded its presence in Southeast Asia. A transaction is not guaranteed, as Suez may decide to retain the assets based on received offers.

          <p>In her first major speech since leaving office, Kamala Harris delivered a sharp critique of Donald Trump's first 100 days back in power, accusing him of deliberately sowing fear and chaos to consolidate executive power. Speaking in San Francisco, Harris warned of a "wholesale abandonment of America’s highest ideals" and a potential constitutional crisis. She praised leaders and institutions resisting Trump's agenda and urged Americans to organize and stand up for fundamental rights. Harris emphasized that courage is contagious and called for collective resistance against what she sees as a decades-long agenda to undermine American democracy.</p>

The Tokyo hospital aims to be a last resort for protecting babies' lives, addressing the rise in unplanned pregnancies and infant abandonment.

          <p>Several European auto manufacturers, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have suspended or cut their full-year financial guidance due to the uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs. These companies cited volatility over tariffs, mitigation measures, and potential direct and indirect effects as reasons for their decisions. While Trump's recent move to ease car tariffs provides partial relief, analysts warn that long-term investment decisions will remain on hold until there is greater certainty around the permanence and extent of the tariffs. Volkswagen and Volvo Cars also expressed concerns, with Volvo Cars ditching its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5 percent, a significant reduction from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent. This decision reflects growing concerns about the potential negative effects of President Trump's trade policies on Japan's exports and corporate profits. The BOJ's decision to hold interest rates steady underscores the challenges posed by trade tensions to its efforts to normalize monetary policy.</p>

          <p>In the trial of Erin Patterson, accused of poisoning her family with a mushroom lunch, her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home. Simon Patterson had been invited to the fatal meal but declined to attend the day before. The prosecution alleges that Erin Patterson invited the group to lunch on the pretense that she had been diagnosed with cancer. The main issue in the case is whether Ms. Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated there is "a very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his own trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, acknowledging that no tariff discussions were underway. Trump reiterated his view that the United States had been "ripped off" by China. Greer, speaking separately, emphasized that Washington seeks a fair trade relationship with China but noted that no official talks are taking place. The conflicting statements highlight the ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade relations.</p>

The survey results underscore a troubling disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and their lived experiences, reflecting a rising societal belief in the stereotype of the “perpetual foreigner.” This perception has real consequences for their safety, sense of belonging, and opportunities in the country.</p>

The original bill sought to limit the benefits to 10 years, but this provision was removed after concerns were raised about violating consumer protection guidelines. The legislation has faced strong opposition from solar owners, schools, and environmental groups, who argue that it would undermine investments in green energy and raise electric bills for those without solar panels.</p>
