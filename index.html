          <p>Fitch Ratings lowered China's sovereign credit rating to 'A' from 'A+' due to rising public debt and weakening finances.  This followed the US imposing increased tariffs on Chinese goods. China's Ministry of Finance criticized the downgrade as biased, while the cost of insuring Chinese debt against default rose significantly. Fitch cited expectations of continued weakening public finances and rising debt levels as the basis for its decision.</p>
