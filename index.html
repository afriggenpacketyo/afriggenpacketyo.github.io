          <p>Following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in 26 fatalities, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar stated that those responsible, including the planners and backers, must face justice. Jaishankar communicated with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio shortly after making this statement. India has long accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism in Kashmir, a charge Pakistan denies. In response to the attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly granted the military full operational freedom to retaliate after a closed-door meeting.</p>

          <p>In her first major address since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris voiced Democratic concerns about the direction of the nation under President Trump, warning of a potential constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to check the president's power. Speaking in San Francisco, Harris acknowledged her recent departure from public life and emphasized the need for courage and organization to protect fundamental rights. She also criticized Trump's agenda as a deliberate effort to undermine American democracy, praising Democratic leaders who have been speaking out against the administration.

          <p>Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces an additional indictment for abuse of authority, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. This development coincides with Yoon's ongoing trial for leading an insurrection related to his declaration of martial law in early December. The Constitutional Court had previously stripped Yoon of his powers and privileges in April, affirming a parliamentary motion to impeach him. The new charge was announced following a raid on Yoon's residence as part of a bribery probe involving his wife and a shaman, with South Korea scheduled to hold a snap election on June 3.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic and inflation projections for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the potential impact of US tariffs on the Japanese economy. The central bank now expects the economy to grow by 0.5% and core consumer prices to rise by 2.2% in fiscal 2025. Despite these revisions, the BOJ has maintained its benchmark interest rate, remaining committed to future rate increases if economic and price conditions align with expectations. The bank anticipates reaching its 2% inflation target in the latter half of the three years through March 2028.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Glasgow have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with species identified as far north as Shetland. The findings come from a citizen science project where the public reported mosquito sightings and submitted photos. Over 20 different species of mosquitoes now call Scotland home, with the insects often found in woodland areas and even urban settings like Glasgow. The research highlights the need to understand the extent of the mosquito population and its potential impact on public health.</p>

          <p>The United States military is facing critical shortages in personnel and essential materiel, making it ill-prepared for a large-scale war, according to Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk. Despite possessing advanced military technology, the US lacks sufficient quantities of ships, ammunition, and soldiers to sustain a prolonged conflict. The focus on high-tech but brittle weapons systems has left the military vulnerable, particularly in comparison to China and Russia, which are rapidly expanding their military capabilities. The authors advocate for increased investment in ammunition production, shipbuilding, and improving the quality of life for service members to address these critical gaps.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to share profits from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, which the Trump administration claims will incentivize continued US investment in Ukraine's defense and reconstruction efforts. The deal establishes a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, intended to repay an estimated $175 billion in aid provided to Ukraine since the war began. Ukrainian officials emphasized that the agreement ensures Ukraine maintains control over its natural resources and that the fund will be split 50-50 with equal voting rights. The deal requires approval by Ukraine's parliament.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has predicted a growth rate of just 0.5 percent for the current fiscal year, a significant downgrade from its previous forecast of 1.1 percent, and decided against raising interest rates. The bank cited the impact of President Trump's tariffs as a major factor contributing to the weaker outlook. The BOJ highlighted concerns about trade policies leading to a slowdown in overseas economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits. The decision underscores the growing global economic concerns stemming from U.S. trade policies.</p>
