          <p>George Leitmann, a 99-year-old Holocaust survivor and US soldier who helped liberate Germany, is cautioning against the return of fascism. Leitmann recounts his experiences witnessing the horrors of war, including the execution of children by the SS, which deeply affected his faith in humanity. He also shares his personal story of escaping Vienna after the Nazi takeover and his subsequent search for his father, who was murdered for being Jewish. Leitmann expresses concern over the current political climate, particularly the rise of leaders who promote divisive ideologies, drawing parallels to the dangers of the past. He emphasizes the importance of empathy and warns against blaming specific groups for societal problems.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can begin enforcing its ban on transgender troops serving in the military, reversing lower court rulings that had blocked the policy. This decision allows the military to discharge transgender service members and cease enlistment of transgender individuals while legal challenges continue. The ruling comes amid broader attacks on transgender rights by the Trump administration, including efforts to restrict transgender athletes and bathroom access. The case involves active service members, including Cmdr. Emily Shilling, who argued that the ban violates the Constitution's equal protection clause. The court's liberal members dissented without providing reasoning.</p>

He emphasized that sales to China would generate revenue, taxes, and jobs in the United States. Huang acknowledged the challenges posed by U.S. export restrictions, which have already led to a $5.5 billion quarterly charge for Nvidia. Despite these restrictions, Huang stressed China's advancements in AI and the formidable presence of companies like Huawei.

Carney emphasized Canada's independence, stating it is "not for sale," while Trump responded with "never say never." The meeting occurred amidst historically strained relations due to Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods and his repeated suggestions of a U.S.-Canada merger. Despite Trump's earlier criticisms of Canada on social media, the tone during the meeting was largely conciliatory, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston is considering whether non-citizens in the U.S. have the same free speech rights as citizens, amidst court battles over the Trump administration's revocation of foreign student visas. Judge William Young suggested it's "not clear" that non-citizens have full free speech rights, particularly as the administration uses students' speech to justify deportations. The case involves a lawsuit from academic organizations accusing the Trump administration of suppressing pro-Palestinian activists' First Amendment rights. The judge specified that pro-Palestinian advocacy and criticism of Israel are considered free speech, and the trial aims to determine if the government committed any retribution against speakers.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu stated the offensive aims to defeat Hamas and that the population will be moved for its own protection, which is considered a war crime under international law.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to hold steady on interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting, facing uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic signals. With unresolved questions and an economy showing both strengths and weaknesses, the Fed is likely to wait and observe how events unfold. Market expectations suggest little chance of a rate cut this week and only a modest probability of a move in June. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will need to address the conflicting data and explain the central bank's thinking on future policy direction.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its ban on transgender military service members, lifting a lower court injunction. The court did not provide a detailed explanation, but the decision means the military can begin discharging transgender service members and halt the enlistment of transgender individuals. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, and litigation continues in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Advocates for transgender service members called the ruling a "devastating blow," asserting the ban is discriminatory and unrelated to military readiness.</p>

Stice cited recession fears stemming from President Trump's tariffs and increased supply from OPEC+ producers as factors contributing to the price decline.
