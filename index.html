            <p>President Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices from his reciprocal tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection guidance. This decision comes after Trump imposed tariffs on products from China, potentially impacting tech giants like Apple. The exemptions are seen as a win for tech companies, allowing them time to move production to the U.S., with White House officials emphasizing the need to reduce reliance on China for critical technologies. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities described this as a "game changer scenario" for the tech sector, removing a significant obstacle to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. government has decided to exempt smartphones, computers, and other electronics from the Trump administration's tariffs, which were primarily targeted at China. This move aims to prevent price increases on essential consumer goods and protect tech companies like Apple. Experts predict that the cost of iPhones could have jumped significantly without the exemptions. The White House stated that the exemptions are intended to encourage companies to onshore their manufacturing to the United States, highlighting the administration's focus on domestic production.</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, which previously secured a large settlement from Fox News on behalf of Dominion Voting Systems, is suing the Trump administration over an executive order targeting the firm. The lawsuit claims the order, which seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and contracts, is unconstitutional and retaliatory. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies. The firm alleges that Trump is attempting to punish them for defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.</p>

            <p>While some technology hardware has received a tariff reprieve, many U.S. businesses face irreversible damage from the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as businesses halt container exports. The American Apparel & Footwear Association warns that these sudden policy changes and high tariffs are disrupting supply chains more severely than the pandemic, leading to lost sales and product shortages. Maersk anticipates a massive restructuring of liner services to North America, resulting in congestion and freight rate spikes.</p>

            <p>The UK has recorded its warmest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching 24C in Northolt, London. This follows a dry, sunny, and warm start to April for many regions. However, large parts of England and Wales are also experiencing "very high" pollen levels, primarily due to Birch and Ash tree pollen. The Met Office forecasts that pollen levels will decrease to "high" or "moderate" by Wednesday as the weather becomes more unsettled.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced it will exclude certain electronics, such as smartphones and laptops, from "reciprocal" tariffs. This decision is expected to benefit tech companies like Apple and Samsung, as well as chip makers like Nvidia. U.S. Customs and Border Protection stated that items like hard drives, flat-panel monitors, and some chips would also be exempt from the current 145% tariffs levied on China and the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. This move is viewed as a positive development for the tech sector, alleviating pressure on U.S. companies.</p>

            <p>An annual bird survey reveals a decline in bird populations across the UK, with starlings being particularly affected. The RSPB suggests small changes in gardens, such as leaving grass uncut and avoiding pesticides, to help survival rates. The author emphasizes the importance of appreciating and befriending birds to encourage a sense of responsibility for their protection. The article also touches on the issue of shoplifting, particularly at Greggs, and the need to address both the crime and its underlying causes.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff strategy is facing scrutiny for its potential negative impact on the U.S. economy. Critics argue that his protectionist policies are based on an outdated vision of manufacturing and fail to recognize the complexities of global supply chains. The difficulties encountered by TSMC in setting up a chip fabrication plant in Arizona highlight the challenges of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. Experts warn that Trump's tariff policies could undermine the credibility of international agreements and damage America's economic dominance.</p>
