          <p>Former Congressman George Santos is scheduled to be sentenced today in his federal fraud case after admitting to a campaign finance scheme, stealing unemployment benefits during the pandemic, and lying on House financial disclosure forms. Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, agreeing to restitution and forfeiture totaling nearly $580,000. The sentencing will determine the consequences for his actions that led to his expulsion from Congress, marking the end of a tumultuous chapter in his political career. The U.S. Department of Justice wants Santos to serve 87 months in prison, while his lawyers are seeking just 24 months.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian general, Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed by a car bomb just outside Moscow, prompting a murder and explosives smuggling investigation.

          <p>In a recent interview, President Trump asserted that he has already "made 200 deals" on tariffs and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, claims that have been disputed by Chinese officials. Trump stated negotiations would be "finished" in 3-4 weeks, though he provided no specifics on the deals or countries involved. He also addressed the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member, and reiterated his view that Ukraine was partly to blame for the war with Russia. The interview offers insights into Trump's approach to trade, immigration, and foreign policy, though the accuracy of some claims is questionable.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials and state-owned companies began preparing for potential fallout from a second Trump administration well before the U.S. election.

The preparations included restricting business trips and focusing on trade-related issues, demonstrating China's anticipation of renewed trade tensions with the United States.

          <p>Demand for private jets has declined significantly, with customer interest in buying business jets falling by 49% since March, according to a Barclays survey. The drop is attributed to concerns about the impact of tariffs on both the aircraft market and overall business operations. Survey respondents indicated that clients are putting purchases on hold due to these fears, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. This decline in demand signals a potential slowdown in the business aviation sector, closely tied to global trade and economic conditions.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge ruled that prosecutors can pursue the death penalty against Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, despite his recent autism diagnosis. The defense argued that Kohberger's autism reduces his culpability and that executing someone with autism would be cruel and unusual punishment. The judge disagreed, stating that autism is not equivalent to an intellectual disability, which would preclude the death penalty under U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The trial is set to begin August 11, adding another layer of complexity to an already highly publicized case.</p>

This agreement, inspired by his family's history, allows Coogler to potentially receive royalties from streaming and television broadcasts, as well as merchandising deals, benefiting his children in the future. Coogler's deal also gave him creative control over the final version of the film and a percentage of box-office revenue upon release. This unique arrangement highlights the growing power of directors to negotiate ownership rights in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Senator Joe Manchin advises Democrats to work with President Trump rather than attacking him at every turn. Manchin, who changed his designation to "Independent" after leaving the Senate, believes Democrats would be more effective by focusing on getting things done. He criticizes the Democratic Party's reaction to issues like the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García, arguing that many Americans do not find Trump's actions as objectionable as Democratic officials do. Manchin's perspective offers a unique insight into navigating the current political landscape and engaging with a Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump insists that the bond market's reaction did not influence his decision to pause the implementation of aggressive "reciprocal" tariffs against U.S. trading partners. Despite market volatility following his initial announcement, Trump claims his decision was based on ongoing negotiations and his desire to achieve desired outcomes. He stated he would consider it a "total victory" even if the U.S. maintains tariffs as high as 50% a year from now. His comments reflect a willingness to use tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, regardless of market reactions.</p>
