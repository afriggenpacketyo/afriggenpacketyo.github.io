Examples include accepting a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, potential conflicts of interest involving Trump's family businesses, and the disbanding of a Justice Department unit focused on cryptocurrency crimes. These actions, along with the relaxation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, have raised concerns about the potential for corruption and the leveraging of public office for personal enrichment. The administration's actions have been emboldened by Supreme Court rulings and Trump's strong hold on the Republican Party.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Slashes 'De Minimis' Tariff Rate on Low-Value Parcels from China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. will slash the "de minimis" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China to 54% from 120%, following an agreement with Beijing. The so-called de minimis loophole had allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship low-value goods to U.S.-based customers duty-free. The Trump administration alleged that shippers in China had been exploiting the loophole to "hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices." Temu has halted shipments of goods from China to the U.S., and is now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based customers' orders and avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry company, is preparing to raise prices and reroute shipments from the United States in response to potential tariffs imposed by President Trump. The company, which manufactures its products in Thailand, faces the possibility of millions of dollars in losses if the tariffs go into effect. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that the company is "battle ready" but is waiting to see how investors, customers, and competitors react before making any major strategic decisions. The company is also considering moving production to Vietnam, but faces potential tariffs there as well.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who spent 38 years in a British prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, had his conviction overturned due to newly available DNA evidence. The DNA evidence, which could not be scientifically analyzed until recently, showed that the semen sample found on Sindall's body did not match Sullivan. Sullivan, now 68, expressed that he was not angry or bitter and was anxious to see his loved ones. The Merseyside Police have reopened the investigation and are committed to finding the real killer.</p>

          <p>Jennie Erin Smith's book, Valley of Forgetting, explores memory, medicine, and hereditary fate in rural Colombia, focusing on families affected by a rare genetic mutation linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The book chronicles the experiences of families and scientists drawn together by the paisa mutation, which causes the illness in nearly everyone who inherits it. Smith suggests that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss; it might also be a chance to explore other forms of humanity grounded in feeling, presence, or touch. The book invites readers to reconsider memory as something relational, inherited, and timeless, rather than strictly personal and chronological.</p>

The bill proposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the proposal would save $880 billion over the next decade but also result in 8.6 million more Americans being uninsured.

          <p>Peter Sullivan is the victim of what is believed to be the longest miscarriage of justice experienced by a living inmate in the UK, serving 38 years for a murder he did not commit. The Crown Prosecution Service did not contest the appeal, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) ordered the DNA tests that led to the quashing of the conviction. Questions are now being raised about the appeals system in England and Wales and whether it is fit for purpose if an innocent man can remain imprisoned for so long. Sullivan's exoneration came down to DNA evidence, raising questions about why his name could not have been cleared sooner.</p>
