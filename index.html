          <h2>AI Tool Recovers Significant Fraudulent Funds for UK Government</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 01:02:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has recovered nearly £500 million in the past year using a new AI tool designed to combat fraud, with over a third of the recovered funds linked to fraudulent activity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The tool has also helped reclaim money from unlawful council tax claims and illegal subletting of social housing. The government intends to license this AI tool, known as the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, to other countries, including the US and Australia, due to its effectiveness in identifying policy weaknesses before they can be exploited. Civil liberties campaigners have previously raised concerns about the government's use of AI in countering fraud, emphasizing the need for fairness and transparency in its application. The savings will be used to recruit nurses, teachers, and police officers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed concerns surrounding the company's ambitious $850 billion infrastructure buildout, stating that it is a necessary response to the soaring demand for AI capabilities. Altman emphasized that the scale of the investment, which includes partnerships with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, is driven by the exponential growth in ChatGPT usage and the need for extensive supercomputing facilities to maximize AI's potential. He acknowledged the worries about potential overinvestment but expressed confidence in the long-term value of AI technology to society. Altman also hinted at hardware developments that could reshape how people use computers, suggesting a future where computers can truly understand and think, though he cautioned that these developments are still in the early stages.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a dominant pitching performance in his final regular-season start, pitching six shutout innings with eight strikeouts, but the Dodgers bullpen squandered a 4-0 lead, resulting in a walk-off loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Manager Dave Roberts noted the ramp-up of intensity and performance in Ohtani's recent starts, suggesting he is ready for a postseason pitching role. The team is now considering how to best utilize Ohtani in their postseason rotation, weighing the benefits of starting him in Game 1 of the wild-card series against managing his workload as a two-way player. The Dodgers are hopeful that Ohtani's pitching stamina will be improved, as he pitched into the sixth inning for the first time this year.</p>

The success of Datong's flood response highlights the importance of investment in infrastructure for urban resilience and economic stimulus. One example she cited was the extra 1 trillion yuan (US$140.56 billion) in sovereign debt Beijing issued towards the end of 2023 to support reconstruction and improve disaster prevention and relief capabilities.</p>

The new legislation aims to enhance the safety of children's camps by restricting cabins in flood zones, requiring emergency plans, mandating worker training, and implementing emergency warning systems.

The court emphasized the need for substantial penalties to ensure the ABC learns from its actions, highlighting the broadcaster's failure to support its employees and the public's trust.

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called for a "criminal process" against former US President Donald Trump regarding missile strikes on alleged drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean. Petro's demand follows Trump's earlier vow to "blow [drug smugglers] out of existence." The strikes, which resulted in over a dozen deaths, are being described by UN experts as an "extrajudicial execution." Petro suspects some of the victims were Colombian citizens, asserting that if confirmed, a criminal investigation should be initiated against Trump and other officials involved in ordering the strikes. Tensions rise as Trump has deployed warships and a submarine to the southern Caribbean to combat drug smugglers off the coast of Venezuela.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" from Russia, marking a significant shift in his position. Trump attributed this possibility to the economic pressures on Russia and the support of Europe and NATO. The comments followed a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who hailed the "big shift" in Trump's position. Trump also suggested that NATO nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace. The statement contrasts with Trump's earlier stance that Ukraine would likely need to cede some territory in negotiations.</p>

These individuals have filed legal claims against the U.S. government.

          <p>Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust has been forced to repay almost £5 million after wrongly claiming it provided safe maternity care. The trust had received the money under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, which rewards hospitals for meeting safety standards. However, a subsequent investigation found that the trust had not met the standards, prompting the repayment. The Care Quality Commission had previously published a damning report about maternity services at the trust, rating care as inadequate. The repayment has prompted calls for a full, independent inquiry into the Leeds trust.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh was found guilty by a Florida jury of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Routh, who represented himself, faced charges including attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer.

After the verdict, Routh attempted to harm himself, prompting intervention by U.S. marshals. This was the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024. Routh faces a potential life sentence.</p>
