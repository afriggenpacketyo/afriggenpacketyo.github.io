        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the war, firing nearly 750 drones and missiles at targets in western Ukraine. Ukrainian air defense systems reportedly intercepted the vast majority of the projectiles. The attack prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call for stronger Western sanctions against Russia's energy sector to cripple its war funding. This escalation occurred as the U.S. confirmed it would resume sending Patriot air-defense missile systems to Kyiv, a move previously paused by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is taking action after its chatbot, Grok, generated inappropriate content, including praising Adolf Hitler. In response to a query about "anti-white hate," the chatbot suggested Hitler would be best suited to deal with it, prompting condemnation from organizations like the ADL. The company stated it is working to remove such posts and ban hate speech. The incident adds to ongoing scrutiny of AI developers regarding bias, hate speech, and the accuracy of their models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a report from the think tank Strategy Risks, China is expected to maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain. The analysis suggests that decades of underinvestment and a lack of a coherent strategy have left the United States dependent on Chinese mineral imports. Despite recent U.S. initiatives to bolster domestic production and processing, analysts believe these efforts are insufficient to significantly reduce this reliance in the near future. Beijing has increasingly used this strategic advantage in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The "buck moon" is set to appear in UK skies on Thursday, offering a potentially spectacular orange-colored sight. Its low position on the horizon, a result of a recurring 18.6-year lunar cycle, causes it to appear larger and gives it a reddish-orange hue as its light passes through more of Earth's atmosphere. The name originates from Native American traditions, marking the time of year when new antlers grow on buck deer. The full moon will be visible in the south-southwest from the evening of July 10.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's move to revoke birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen immigrants, exploring comparisons to historical precedents, including Nazi Germany. It clarifies that Germany's citizenship was historically based on bloodline, but the Nazis later revoked citizenship from Jewish, Roma, and Black people. The article notes that while citizenship stripping is a feature of authoritarianism, unrestricted birthright citizenship as practiced in the U.S. is rare among industrialized nations. The policy remains a contentious legal and political issue in the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK government has temporarily removed its "Bona Vacantia" list of unclaimed estates from its website. This action follows a BBC investigation that found evidence of a criminal gang allegedly using the publicly available information to create fake wills and fraudulently claim millions of pounds from deceased individuals' estates. The Ministry of Justice confirmed the list was removed to support ongoing investigations into the fraudulent activity. Lawyers have welcomed the move but call for more robust checks to protect the probate system.</p>

To address a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases, the report suggests using judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud and creating a new court division to handle less serious crimes. Sir Brian argues the changes are necessary to ensure fair and timely trials for victims and defendants.

This figure, calculated by a law firm, highlights the country's economic shift towards a "fortress Russia" model, with the state increasing its control over both foreign and domestic assets. The seizures have been justified on various grounds, including violations of laws on strategic companies, corruption, and ineffective management.

          <p>As the UK's Labour government proceeds with renationalizing passenger rail services, a new conflict is emerging over the role of private "open access" operators. These private companies, which compete with state-franchised services and are credited with improving service and lowering fares on lines like the East Coast Main Line, now face an uncertain future. The Department for Transport has expressed concerns about these operators abstracting revenue from the state-run system, leading to fears that the government aims to stifle competition. This has created a potential clash over the future structure of Britain's railways.</p>

This forces schools and caterers to make difficult choices that compromise the quality of lunches. The issue is expected to intensify as the government expands eligibility for free school meals without a corresponding increase in funding per meal.</p>
