          <p>According to a court filing, a group of deported migrants is being held in a converted shipping container at a U.S. military base in Djibouti, East Africa, guarded by ICE officers. The migrants have been stuck there for over two weeks after their flight to South Sudan was rerouted due to a judge's ruling, stemming from challenges to the Trump administration's deportation efforts. The ICE officers are facing limited resources and difficult working conditions, including high temperatures, exposure to malaria, and proximity to burn pits, while the detainees have limited communication with their families and no access to lawyers. The situation highlights the legal battles surrounding the Trump administration's immigration policies. Optimism is low as the situation highlights the ongoing challenges and potential human rights concerns related to immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged gang member who was deported to El Salvador but brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges. Trump stated that the Department of Justice made the decision, expressing confidence in their case and suggesting the move was intended to demonstrate the severity of Garcia's alleged crimes. Garcia faces charges of human smuggling and conspiracy, with allegations of involvement in a smuggling ring that transported women, children, and MS-13 gang members. The case has sparked controversy, with some Democrats advocating for Garcia's return while authorities claim he poses a danger to the community.</p>

The decision stems from a dispute over the AP's Stylebook and its use of "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America."

          <p>The Organization of American States (OAS) has voiced serious concerns regarding Mexico's recent judicial elections, citing low voter turnout and a lack of awareness among voters. The OAS mission highlighted the "extremely complex" and "polarizing" nature of the election, in which Mexicans elected hundreds of federal and state judges. The OAS also raised concerns about the distribution of "cheat sheets" promoting certain candidates and the potential loss of judicial independence. Given these findings, the OAS mission does not recommend replicating this model of judge selection in other countries.</p>

Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves suggests the dish has cultural ties to Wales, with cheese being a vital part of the Welsh diet since the Middle Ages.
