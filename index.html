          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded defeat to Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat and state assemblyman, in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset for the former governor who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. In his concession speech, Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's victory and indicated he would consider his next steps. The primary is seen as a crucial indicator for the Democratic Party as it navigates its messaging following recent election losses. Mamdani's win was unexpected given that counting was expected to continue due to the ranked-choice system, making Cuomo's concession even more surprising. The win is considered a massive victory for Mamdani, signaling that New York Democrats are looking for leaders who are enthusiastic and courageous in the face of President Trump.</p>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal, spearheaded by Senator Mike Lee, to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from the tax and spending bill due to Senate rules violations. The proposal aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land to address housing needs, but opponents doubted this outcome. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal violated the Byrd Rule, which prevents including extraneous, non-budgetary provisions in a reconciliation bill. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision, though Lee indicated he would continue to pursue the plan with revisions.</p>

          <p>New satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies shows significant damage to key Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan following U.S. airstrikes ordered by President Donald Trump. The images reveal craters along access roads and at tunnel entrances at Fordow, while the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center also shows signs of destruction. At Natanz, craters caused by U.S. ordnance appear to be filled and covered with dirt, suggesting targeted strikes on underground centrifuge halls. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, with American officials claiming the strikes severely set back Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months, but did not completely destroy it. The assessment found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, were sealed off, potentially delaying the resumption of the enrichment program depending on the time required to clear the entrances and repair essential supplies. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed the assessment, calling it "flat-out wrong," while others have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities could intensify its determination to develop a weapon.</p>

While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen significantly since 1990, transport and buildings remain major emitters.

          <p>As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) increased raids across Los Angeles, Regina Higuera, a grandmother who lived in the U.S. for 36 years, chose to self-deport to Mexico, leaving behind her U.S. citizen children and grandchildren. Higuera, who entered the U.S. illegally at 15, made the decision to maintain control over her life and avoid the uncertainty of potential ICE encounters. Since President Trump's second term began, ICE has arrested over 100,000 people, and the administration has encouraged self-deportation, even offering incentives for migrants to return to their home countries voluntarily.

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the FBI is sharpening its focus on counter-terrorism efforts, including shifting agents from immigration-related cases. U.S. immigration officials have arrested 11 Iranian citizens, some with alleged ties to Iran's military and paramilitary groups. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have communicated with state leaders and law enforcement agencies about the heightened threat environment. Authorities emphasize there are no credible threats to U.S. soil, but heightened vigilance is in place at sensitive sites, including those connected to the U.S., Israel, or Judaism.</p>

          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff condemned the leak of an initial intelligence assessment regarding the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, calling it "treasonous." The assessment, from the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff also affirmed that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months, deeming it "not even conceivable."</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese astronomers reveals that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, providing insights into how new stars are born. By analyzing thousands of stars using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it more challenging for massive stars to form. The study offers direct evidence that the Milky Way‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

Gudinas was pronounced dead after receiving a lethal injection at Florida state prison. His last words referenced repentance and Jesus. Gudinas was the seventh person put to death in Florida this year, contributing to what is on track to be the year with the most executions since 2015 in the United States. Appeals filed by his attorneys, arguing that evidence related to ‚Äúlifelong mental illnesses‚Äù exempted Gudinas from being put to death, were rejected.</p>
