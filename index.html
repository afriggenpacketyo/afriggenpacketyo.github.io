        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly close to deciding whether to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a known adversary of President Trump. The potential charges are linked to allegations of lying to Congress in 2020 concerning the origins of the FBI's 2016 Russian election interference investigation, with the statute of limitations expiring soon. Prosecutors are considering presenting a case to a grand jury, which would require a majority vote for probable cause. This development is seen as a significant escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to target political opponents, with the president publicly urging action against Comey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally mandate states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain FEMA grants. This decision, favoring 20 mostly Democratic states, marks a legal setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The states argued that the policy violated federal law and the Constitution, risking billions in disaster aid and undermining trust in local police. The ruling deemed the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," emphasizing the irreparable harm states would face from losing critical emergency funds.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has issued a temporary stay on the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm, following protests from the owners. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ordered the cull due to an avian flu outbreak that killed 69 birds, citing risks of mutation and human health. The farm owners, who were briefly arrested for obstruction, have engaged in a months-long legal battle, attracting international attention and offers to re-home the birds. The court's decision allows the owners to appeal while the CFIA maintains custody and care of the ostriches.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has instructed federal agencies to develop reduction-in-force (RIF) plans in anticipation of a potential government shutdown on October 1. This guidance requires agencies to consider issuing RIF notices to employees involved in programs not legally mandated to continue if funding lapses. The memo, which also blames Democrats for "insane demands" potentially leading to a shutdown, suggests that while short-term funding bills are usually bipartisan, this year is different. The administration hopes Congress will pass a clean continuing resolution to avoid a lapse in discretionary spending.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched national security investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and various medical devices. This move could lead to new tariffs, increasing costs for consumers, hospitals, and manufacturers. The probes cover personal protective equipment like masks and gloves, as well as critical medical equipment such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, reflecting concerns about reliance on overseas supply chains. The Department of Commerce is seeking public comments on domestic demand, production capacity, and the impact of foreign subsidies, with potential new duties stacking atop existing tariffs.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced recently, will largely be utilized by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread the significant costs of building AI supercomputing facilities over time, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. The initial $10 billion will help kickstart the first gigawatt-capacity data center, expected in late 2026. While the deal aids OpenAI's compute needs and debt financing, some analysts express concern about its "circular nature," questioning whether it genuinely creates new value or merely inflates market numbers.

          <p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, speaking ahead of his historic UN address, warned that Israel's military actions in the region could jeopardize U.S. interests and push its allies away. He cited recent Israeli attacks on Hamas leaders in Qatar and airstrikes near Syria's presidential palace as declarations of war, emphasizing the need for international standards and laws. Al-Sharaa, whose former rebel group was recently delisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S., expressed Syria's commitment to a security agreement with Israel to de-escalate tensions, advocating for the return of seized lands and UN peacekeeper monitoring.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has alleged "triple sabotage" at the United Nations, claiming three "sinister events" marred his appearance. He stated an escalator carrying him and the First Lady abruptly stopped, nearly causing a fall, and his teleprompter went dark during his speech. Additionally, he claimed world leaders couldn't hear his address. Trump demanded an immediate investigation, with the Secret Service reportedly involved, citing a newspaper report that UN staff joked about turning off escalators. UN officials, however, attributed the escalator stop to a videographer inadvertently triggering a safety function and noted the teleprompter was a White House responsibility.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is causing significant concern across the US tech sector, particularly for startups and smaller firms. While initially applying to future applicants, the fee is seen as a crippling burden for companies that rely on skilled foreign workers. Critics argue this policy could lead to a "brain drain" and hinder innovation and economic growth, potentially prompting companies to offshore operations. Supporters, however, suggest large tech giants can absorb the cost. The move is part of a broader overhaul of the H-1B program, aiming to prioritize higher-paid workers. (not investment advice)</p>

Prosecutors, who sought a 10-year sentence, criticized the court's decision for minimizing the crime's gravity. The incident highlights issues of police accountability and conflicts of interest, with the county settling a civil suit for $6.95 million. Rodriguez received credit for time served, and his ex-girlfriend's accessory charge was dropped.</p>
