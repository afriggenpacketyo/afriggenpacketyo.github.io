          <p>Former President Barack Obama advised Democratic donors to "toughen up" and abandon the search for a political "messiah," urging them to support pragmatic candidates who can win elections. Speaking at a fundraiser, he called for less "whining" and more courage in defending core principles like free speech, even when it's uncomfortable. Obama emphasized the importance of backing viable candidates in upcoming gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, such as Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger. He also stressed that progressive ideals and practical solutions, like addressing housing shortages through zoning reform, are not mutually exclusive.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victorville, California, arrested a man for allegedly filing a false emergency report and planting evidence as part of a prank. The incident involved a grotesque teddy bear, seemingly made of human skin, which was left at a gas station, prompting a police response. The San Bernardino County coroner quickly determined the bear was not made of human remains, and the creator, a South Carolina artist, confirmed it was one of her creations sold online. Officials highlighted that such hoaxes waste valuable emergency resources and can delay responses to genuine crises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly considering resignation following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The conflict stems from unfulfilled expectations within the MAGA movement regarding a supposed "client list," which the Department of Justice has stated does not exist. This internal feud has positioned Bongino, a former right-wing media personality whose appointment was already controversial, as a potential casualty of the fallout. The situation highlights deep divisions among Trump's supporters and questions the stability of leadership within federal law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>An assault rifle and five magazines of ammunition that fell from a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department vehicle were safely recovered after a resident found them. The department had publicly disclosed the loss and detailed the deputies' route, appealing for public assistance in locating the weapon. A Lennox resident discovered the hard-shelled case, initially thinking it might contain a musical instrument, and promptly turned it in to the South Los Angeles sheriff's station. Officials expressed deep gratitude for the community member's integrity, which prevented a dangerous weapon from remaining on the streets.</p>

The turbine discs must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, and improving their manufacturing process is key to advancing the country's military aviation capabilities.

Maxwell's legal team argued that a co-conspirator clause in Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement should have barred her prosecution. However, the DOJ countered that the agreement was limited to the Southern District of Florida and did not have nationwide authority, also noting Maxwell was not a named beneficiary. Attorneys for Epstein's victims supported the DOJ's position, stating Maxwell should remain imprisoned for the "horrific crimes she committed."</p>

          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has forcefully reaffirmed his country's commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, describing it as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values. Speaking at a business forum, Peña stated that Paraguay would defend the ties "with all its strength." This declaration comes after an incident where a Beijing-based envoy allegedly attempted to persuade opposition lawmakers to switch diplomatic recognition to China. Paraguay is one of the few remaining countries that officially recognizes Taiwan over the People's Republic of China.</p>

          <p>A report by brokerage firm Jefferies indicates that China is becoming a "biotech supermarket" for global pharmaceutical companies, who are increasingly looking to the country for innovative drug candidates. At the world's largest cancer research conference, nearly a third of presentations involved drugs from Chinese firms, a dramatic increase from a decade ago. The report notes that multinational corporations are attracted by China's cost efficiencies, accelerated development timelines, and promising quality. This trend involves deals where global firms acquire rights to develop and market Chinese-discovered compounds in international markets.</p>

          <p>A new Photo Booth Museum has opened in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, catering to a growing enthusiasm for the "analog magic" of old-school photography. Operated by San Francisco-based Photomatica, the venue features four restored vintage analog photo booths, some from the 1950s, alongside one modern digital booth. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the analog machines use original chemical processing, producing unique black-and-white photo strips. The museum aims to provide an interactive and nostalgic experience, tapping into the appeal that physical, spontaneous photography holds for digital natives.</p>

This total is the second-lowest in Test cricket history and the worst since 1955. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs, including five wickets in just 15 balls for the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history.

According to White House sources, Trump feels personally insulted and humiliated by Vladimir Putin's refusal to heed his calls for a ceasefire, making him appear weak. After months of believing he could broker a deal, Trump has grown angry that Putin has ignored his pleas and escalated the conflict instead. This change in posture is seen as a reaction to being publicly defied by the Russian leader.</p>
