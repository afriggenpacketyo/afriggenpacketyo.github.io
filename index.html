          <h2>UK Rental Costs Have Surged by Over £200 Monthly in Three Years, Analysis Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by property portal Zoopla reveals that the average monthly rent in the UK has increased by £221 over the past three years, reaching £1,283. This surge, driven by high demand and a shortage of available properties, mirrors the rise in mortgage repayments for homeowners. The financial pressure has forced some tenants to turn down job opportunities or seek parental assistance, making homeownership seem unattainable for many young people. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, more affordable areas are still experiencing sharp rent hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter provide strong evidence that the aircraft has entered production and is nearing operational readiness. The images clearly show the jets with "Chinese navy" markings and "Flying Shark" insignia on their tails, indicating formal integration into the naval aviation force. Military analysts, including a former PLA instructor, suggest that the visible serial numbers point to a low-rate initial production run. This development signifies a major step towards deploying the fifth-generation fighters on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, enhancing its naval combat capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Family of Man Fatally Injured in MRI Accident Alleges Technician Negligence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:57:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The family of a 61-year-old man who died after a tragic accident involving an MRI machine on Long Island is blaming the technician for his death. They claim the technician invited the man, Keith McAllister, into the scanning room to assist his wife but failed to warn him about the machine's powerful magnetic field. McAllister, who was wearing a metal chain, was pulled into the machine and remained stuck for nearly an hour, suffering several heart attacks before passing away. The family has clarified that he was authorized to be in the room, contradicting some reports, as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 individuals from Afghanistan and Cameroon. While acknowledging the plaintiffs have a plausible case, the court found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation during the ongoing lawsuit. This decision puts thousands of TPS recipients at risk of deportation unless they can secure another form of legal status. Advocacy groups have expressed alarm, warning that lives will be upended and allies could be forced into hiding or deported to countries the State Department still considers dangerous.</p>

          <p>President Trump's critics, including former Republican congressman Joe Walsh and Senator Adam Schiff, allege he is attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. They point to a recent flurry of social media posts from Trump on unrelated topics, such as demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their old name and attacking a federal judge. This follows a Department of Justice announcement that it would not release additional Epstein files, a move that has angered some of Trump's own supporters. The White House maintains the president is being transparent, but critics see it as a deliberate distraction strategy.</p>

Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations and standards that hinder commerce and economic growth. The external pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movements to remove these internal barriers in Canada and China. The piece suggests that the economic drag from these internal obstacles could be as significant as the tariffs imposed by the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmer remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files, citing the emotional rollercoaster for victims and his past association with Epstein.

The White House press secretary stated the Journal was excluded due to its "fake and defamatory conduct."

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and prompting a debate among global timekeepers. This trend could necessitate the first-ever "negative leap second"—subtracting a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with the planet's rotation. Factors influencing the spin include the moon's gravity, atmospheric changes, and movements in Earth's liquid core. While climate change-induced ice melt has a counteracting slowing effect, the overall acceleration raises concerns about the stability of computer systems, satellites, and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is using the judicial system and a confrontational stance toward judges to advance its agenda, potentially altering the balance of power in the U.S. government. Having reshaped the Supreme Court, the administration is now targeting lower federal courts with verbal attacks and challenges to their authority, particularly regarding nationwide injunctions that have stalled its policies. While the president's supporters argue he is fighting judicial overreach, some retired and active judges describe the situation as an unprecedented assault on the judiciary's legitimacy, raising concerns about long-term integrity.</p>

          <p>The 13-year-old step-grandson of reality TV star Duane "Dog the Bounty Hunter" Chapman has died from a gunshot wound in what is being described as a tragic accident. The incident occurred in Naples, Florida, where the teenager, Anthony, was allegedly shot by his own father, Gregory Zecca, who is Chapman's stepson. The Collier County Sheriff's Office is investigating the shooting as an isolated incident, and no arrests have been made. In a statement, Chapman and his wife, Francie, confirmed the death of their "beloved grandson" and asked for privacy as their family grieves the incomprehensible loss.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to systematically implement race-based preferences in admissions, hiring, and scholarships, thereby violating federal civil rights law. The group argues that such policies are not only illegal but also indefensible in medicine, where merit should be the sole criterion. This move is part of a broader conservative legal strategy targeting DEI programs in major institutions.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid where she was killed. The sentencing has drawn attention to the shifting priorities of the Justice Department, as the Trump administration had recommended only a one-day sentence, a stark contrast to the Biden administration which originally brought the charges. This case highlights broader changes within the DOJ under Trump, including the rollback of police oversight agreements and a reported exodus of attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, concerning civil rights advocates.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's presidency is characterized not by a coherent policy agenda but by a culture of small-minded vengefulness and personal grievance. The author contends that many of the administration's actions, from renaming military bases to feuds with former officials and international leaders, stem from emotional reactions and a desire for retribution. The article suggests this approach taints the executive branch and leads to erratic decision-making on critical issues, such as the war in Ukraine or Federal Reserve policy. This focus on personal slights over substantive problems is described as a defining, and detrimental, feature of his leadership.</p>

The plan also includes increasing the number of detainees at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The piece suggests that as the nominations process restarts, Bove's controversial background and alignment with Trump's political movement are drawing significant scrutiny.
