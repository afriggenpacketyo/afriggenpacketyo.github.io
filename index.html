          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The blast occurred at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, representing the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. While the investigation is ongoing, senior law enforcement officials indicated the explosion may have involved a grenade that the department's bomb squad was attempting to render safe. The incident has prompted a wide response from local, state, and federal agencies, with officials emphasizing the tragic loss of the three veteran deputies.</p>

          <p>China's top market regulator, the SAMR, summoned major e-commerce companies including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address concerns over an aggressive delivery price war. The meeting aimed to regulate promotional behaviors and encourage rational competition to foster a healthier market for consumers, merchants, and platform operators. The regulator emphasized that these companies must adhere to existing laws regarding e-commerce and unfair competition. In a separate meeting, the SAMR also addressed food safety issues related to products sold during live-streaming e-commerce sessions.</p>

          <p>In response to deadly sectarian violence in southern Syria, the Syrian presidency announced it will deploy a new force to halt clashes between Bedouin and Druze fighters. The conflict near the city of Suweida has reportedly resulted in nearly 600 deaths, prompting calls for restraint. The announcement follows reports of a potential ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, embraced by neighboring countries. The UN human rights chief has expressed alarm over credible reports of widespread abuses, including summary executions, by multiple parties involved in the fighting.</p>

          <p>Italy is confronting a deepening demographic crisis as its national birth rate has fallen to a record low of just 1.18 babies per woman, far below the replacement level. This trend is causing small towns, like Fregona in the Veneto region, to shrink and face the loss of essential services such as primary schools. Despite government initiatives like cash bonuses, many Italians cite a lack of affordable childcare, job insecurity, and high living costs as significant barriers to having more children, suggesting that current policies are insufficient to reverse the decline.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong and encouraging performance, pitching six innings and allowing only one run in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. Although the team was shut out, Glasnow's outing was a significant step forward as he returns from an injury-plagued season. His ability to pitch deep into the game with increased velocity is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on him to be a dependable force in their starting rotation for the remainder of the season and any potential playoff run.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy may inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread, or metastasis, of cancer to other organs. The findings, observed in mice with breast cancer, help explain why some patients experience metastasis even after their primary tumors are successfully treated. The research team also identified specific drugs that could potentially inhibit this detrimental effect when used in combination with chemotherapy, and a clinical trial involving breast cancer patients is already underway to explore this strategy.</p>

The innovative concept involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, a configuration they claim could nearly double the firing force of the navy's current railgun technology. This significant increase in power would enable the weapon to launch heavier, more destructive projectiles, potentially overcoming the power limitations that have hindered the practical military application of existing railguns.</p>

This shipment is part of a larger aid package and underscores Australia's role as one of the most significant non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort. The tanks are expected to provide a substantial boost to Ukraine's ground combat capabilities. Since the conflict began, Australia has provided over a billion dollars in military and humanitarian aid and has imposed sanctions on numerous Russian entities.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a retired Marine Corporal, found a unique way to heal from the trauma of the Vietnam War by building a carousel he had envisioned during combat. While stationed at a dangerous outpost, a music box from his sister inspired a recurring daydream of a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow, which helped him cope. After years of struggling with PTSD, he began building the "Carousel of Happiness" in Colorado in 1986, a project that has now brought joy to over a million people and provided him with profound personal healing.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the "GENIUS Act" into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation provides clear rules for banks, credit unions, and nonbank financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins backed one-to-one by assets like the U.S. dollar. The administration and crypto industry supporters hailed the act as a landmark achievement that provides consumer protections, strengthens the dollar's role in digital finance, and legitimizes the broader cryptocurrency market.
