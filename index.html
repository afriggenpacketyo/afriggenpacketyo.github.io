          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include assertions that windmills are driving whales crazy, killing birds in large numbers, and are not truly green due to recycling issues. The article cites scientific evidence and reports from organizations like NOAA Fisheries and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to counter these claims. It clarifies that while some negative impacts exist, they are often exaggerated or overshadowed by other factors and that the wind energy industry is actively working to mitigate them.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly taking a more assertive approach to addressing antisemitism, launching investigations and intensifying immigration enforcement practices. The DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division stated she has not seen any "close cases" when weighing antisemitic behavior against First Amendment rights. She noted that violent rhetoric has led to violent acts in the U.S., citing examples such as attacks on Jewish individuals and institutions. The administration is also engaged in litigation with universities accused of fostering antisemitism and is focusing on non-citizen students and activists accused of supporting Palestinian causes in ways deemed hostile to U.S. interests.</p>

The Trump administration claimed he was a member of MS-13, which his family denies. After court battles, the Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return, but the administration said it could not bring him back.

          <p>This article examines the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit. The Delaware program also includes a work requirement and financial counseling, helping recipients save money through flat monthly payments and interest-bearing savings accounts. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover and upward mobility, others argue there's little evidence they boost employment or help people move off subsidies, citing a failed experiment in Washington state.

          <p>This article discusses how fees on forgotten 401(k) accounts can significantly reduce retirement savings. Former employees who leave their 401(k) with their previous employer may be charged maintenance fees that erode their balance over time. While rolling over funds into an IRA is an option, it can also come with higher investment fees. The Department of Labor has created a database to help workers find lost retirement plans, and updating contact information can also help reconnect individuals with their accounts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The death of a 9-year-old girl who became unresponsive after dental surgery in San Diego County has been ruled an accident. The girl, Silvanna Moreno, died from a rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia, which could have been triggered by the administration of nitrous oxide and other anesthetic medications. The dental facility where Moreno underwent surgery stated that the death was not due to dosage but instead due to her rare but undiagnosed/undetected medical condition. The San Diego Police Department has closed its investigation into the case.</p>

          <h2>US Reliance on Elon Musk for Space Access</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has become increasingly reliant on Elon Musk's SpaceX for access to space, including critical and secret operations. This dependence is now jeopardized by the escalating feud between Musk and President Trump. SpaceX dominates both the U.S. and global launch markets, and the Defense Department relies heavily on its Starlink satellite internet service. The situation highlights the potential danger of having a single powerful individual like Musk in control of a critical technology. </p>
