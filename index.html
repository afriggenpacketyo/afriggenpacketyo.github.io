        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has temporarily blocked Mayor Eric Adams' plan to allow ICE agents to operate within the Rikers Island jail complex. Judge Mary Rosado issued a restraining order preventing the city from implementing any agreement with the federal government until an April 25 hearing, following a lawsuit from the New York City Council. The council alleges that Adams engaged in an illegal "quid pro quo" with the Trump administration, trading ICE access for the dismissal of federal corruption charges, prioritizing his political goals over the city's sanctuary laws. ICE was previously banned from Rikers in 2014 due to sanctuary policies. The mayor's office has not yet commented. </p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles is proposing to add 227 positions to the fire department in her budget for 2025-26, months after the city experienced its most destructive wildfire in modern history. The proposal includes hiring new firefighters and emergency medical technicians, aiming to address what officials say has been under-resourcing for over a decade. This move comes after the previous Fire Chief Kristin Crowley stated that budget cuts hindered the department's ability to combat the Palisades fire, which destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and caused multiple deaths. The budget also includes a new Homeless Fire Protection and Street Medicine Program to address the increasing number of fires linked to homelessness.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to the freeze of $2.2 million in funding, alleging the administration is attempting to control academic decision-making. Harvard's president, Alan M Garber, accuses the administration of dictating what private universities can teach and whom they can admit, hire, and what areas of study they can pursue. The Trump administration has targeted multiple Ivy League institutions following student activism related to the war in Gaza, painting campus protests as anti-American and the institutions as liberal and antisemitic, claims that Garber refutes.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have developed a detailed blueprint of the crab-eating macaque’s claustrum, a brain region believed to play a role in consciousness. The map details connections between nerve cells in the macaque claustrum and the rest of the brain, potentially aiding in understanding cognitive functions like memory integration and abstract thinking. The research also revealed differences in the structure and cell types of macaque and rodent claustrums, offering clues into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. While there is no scientific consensus on how consciousness is generated, this research may help to unlock the secrets of the mind.</p>

          <p>An experiment has launched into orbit to assess the viability of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) project will test growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats under low gravity and higher radiation conditions. The ultimate goal is to develop a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years, potentially leading to factories in orbit and on the Moon. This could revolutionize long-term space missions by significantly reducing the expense of sending food from Earth.</p>

Norman's remains were discovered buried under a shed on her property, partially encased in concrete. Zizz, who had dinner with Norman on the night she disappeared, fled the state but was apprehended in Montana. Investigators believe Zizz returned to Norman's home multiple times after dinner, and he demolished and rebuilt the shed after Norman's family filed a missing person report. Zizz is now facing charges of first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, and unlawful disposal of human remains.</p>

Concerns about the safety of U.S. assets are growing, with the dollar index sliding to its lowest level since 2022 and gold reaching a record high. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates has fueled investor anxieties about the White House potentially defying norms and replacing the central bank chief. (not investment advice)</p>

The algae bloom, which started earlier this year than previous ones, is attributed to an upswell in the ocean, climate change, and runoff from recent fires. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the bloom, accumulates in fish and is then ingested by marine mammals, causing seizures and other neurological issues.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming the withholding of funds is part of a pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to government control over its academic programs.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia following a trade case brought by American manufacturers. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The case was initiated by companies like Hanwha Qcells and First Solar Inc, who alleged that Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Southeast Asia were shipping panels priced below their cost of production and receiving unfair subsidies. Dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while countervailing duties are between 14.64% and 3,403.96%.</p>

          <p>As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed. The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.</p>
