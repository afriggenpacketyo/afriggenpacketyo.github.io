          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth, driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector, surpassed economists' expectations. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank has already loosened monetary policy, and low inflation figures may support further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is intensifying its efforts to combat a national shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to hire 2,000 new personnel by the end of the year. Utilizing advanced simulation technology at its Oklahoma City training facility, the FAA has cut weeks off the certification time and streamlined the administrative hiring process. This initiative, part of a larger $12.5 billion infrastructure boost, comes in response to staffing shortages that caused flight delays at major airports. Officials report they are on track to meet their hiring goals, with a record number of students currently in training.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:25:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts as businesses rushed shipments during a temporary tariff truce with the United States. In a significant reversal of this year's trend, imports also saw a 1.1% rise, marking the first increase in 2025 and suggesting a potential stabilization in domestic demand. The data reflects exporters' efforts to diversify markets away from the U.S. toward regions like Southeast Asia. Officials from both nations are reportedly working to implement a recent trade framework ahead of an August deadline to secure a more durable agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recovery efforts for victims of the catastrophic July 4th flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, were temporarily suspended due to a new flood threat from heavy thunderstorms. The Guadalupe River, which previously swelled and caused over 100 deaths in the county, was again at risk of overflowing, prompting fresh warnings and evacuations. The initial disaster, which killed at least 132 people statewide, has left 166 more unaccounted for. Search and rescue operations, involving multiple agencies and volunteers, have been intermittently hampered by the dangerous weather and difficult terrain across Central Texas.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent advocate for women's rights in France, has received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She is recognized for her courage in publicly testifying about being drugged and sexually assaulted by her ex-husband, who also invited dozens of other men to abuse her over a decade. Her insistence on a public trial led to the conviction of 51 men and ignited a national conversation about sexual violence. Pelicot's actions are credited with influencing legislative reforms that now incorporate a lack of consent into France's legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced that it tracked down and killed the Russian agents responsible for the daylight assassination of a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The colonel, Ivan Voronych, was reportedly involved in covert operations in Russian-occupied territories. According to the SBU, the suspected agents were killed after resisting arrest. The assassination is the latest in a series of high-profile killings of military and pro-Kremlin figures that have occurred since Russia's full-scale invasion, with both sides accusing the other of orchestrating such attacks as the war continues to rage.</p>

          <p>A violent shooting spree in Lexington, Kentucky, left two people dead at a church and the suspect also killed. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop. The gunman then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he fatally shot two individuals, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and wounded two others. The rampage ended when Lexington police officers arrived at the church and shot and killed the suspect. Officials believe the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of their season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, securing a 5.5-game lead in the NL West. The team's performance has been a mix of highs and lows, featuring a dominant offense led by stars like Shohei Ohtani and an injury-plagued pitching staff. While they hold the best record in the National League, the team has faced challenges, including a struggling bullpen and slumps from key veteran players. Despite these inconsistencies, the Dodgers enter the All-Star break in a strong position to contend for a repeat championship.</p>

          <p>A new "State of the UK Climate" report from the Met Office warns that the country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency due to global warming. The assessment concludes that the UK now has a "notably different" climate than just a few decades ago, characterized by more very hot days and wetter winters. The report highlights that recent years are among the warmest on record, and this shift is increasing the risk of severe weather events like storms and flooding. Scientists emphasize the urgent need for the UK to adapt to these changes, which are also impacting the natural world.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservative figures abroad, is facing weakening power at home. While his playbook of targeting liberal values has been successful for years, a new political challenger from the center-right, Peter Magyar, is gaining significant traction. Magyar has capitalized on a government scandal and public frustration with the state of hospitals, schools, and the economy. As Orban's long-established strategies show signs of failing domestically, Hungary is approaching its most significant political challenge to his 15-year rule ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A severe, multi-year drought in northern Mexico is escalating a water-sharing dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but it is currently in arrears. Farmers in Chihuahua, Mexico, where reservoirs are at critically low levels, argue they cannot give what they don't have. Meanwhile, Texan farmers and the Trump administration insist Mexico must fulfill its obligations, with the president threatening tariffs. The conflict highlights the growing strain that climate change and resource scarcity are placing on international agreements.</p>

King Charles III will host the president and first lady at Windsor Castle, as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations. This invitation is seen as a strategic move by the British government to maintain close ties, as second-term presidents are not traditionally offered a full state visit. The trip will include a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, though it is unlikely to feature public-facing events due to security concerns similar to those during his 2019 visit.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a larger strategy to onshore production and reduce national security risks associated with trade deficits. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett acknowledged that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Brazil but argued that an overall global strategy is necessary to prevent transshipping and achieve long-term objectives. The move was questioned as Trump's letter to Brazil also mentioned the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, but the administration maintained the primary justification was economic and national security.

The rapper appeared agitated and raced through a shortened setlist, referencing the venue's strict curfew. The brief show was a stark contrast to his longer, guest-filled performances on the previous two nights. The abrupt ending, combined with scheduling changes earlier in the day, led to fan discontent. The festival also faced criticism for issues at its accessible exit, where attendees reported being held in a restrictive space after the show.</p>
