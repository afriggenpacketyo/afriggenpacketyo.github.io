          <p>As part of a broader 9,000-job reduction, Microsoft has laid off 830 employees in its home state of Washington, impacting various departments. The cuts include game designers, engineers, lawyers, and sales staff, according to a document filed with state employment officials. This move is part of a corporate effort to eliminate redundancy and encourage a focus on new technologies like artificial intelligence. The company's fastest-growing Azure cloud services division also saw some positions eliminated in the restructuring.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of MPs has reported that the UK Home Office does not know if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their visas expire. The report criticizes the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the skilled worker visa route was introduced in 2020. This lack of basic information raises concerns about the government's ability to manage immigration effectively and tackle the exploitation of workers, a problem the committee described as widespread.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, are entering partnerships with nuclear energy producers to power their energy-intensive AI data centers. These collaborations aim to restart and relicense nuclear plants, such as Three Mile Island, to provide the vast, stable electricity required for artificial intelligence operations. This trend aligns with a push from the Trump administration to quadruple domestic nuclear power production, addressing concerns that the current U.S. electric grid cannot support the rapid growth of AI.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, officially named 3I/ATLAS, which is currently passing through our solar system. This marks the third known object to visit from another star system, following the detections of 'Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet, which poses no threat to Earth, is being closely monitored by astronomers worldwide to determine its size, shape, and composition as it makes its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

Sultana, who was suspended from the Labour whip last year, cited the government's policies on Gaza, welfare, and the cost of living as primary motivations for her departure.</p>

The suit claims that the park's plan to create a "truth-telling" exhibit on the site's historical ties to slavery, segregation, and the Ku Klux Klan violates state law. The exhibit was approved in 2021 as part of an effort to provide more complete historical context to the controversial carving.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Trump administration, permitting the deportation of eight noncitizens who have been held at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The men are set to be sent to South Sudan, a war-torn country with which nearly all of them have no personal ties, and where their lawyers argue they could face immediate detention or other perils. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the majority for giving the administration special treatment.</p>

          <p>A key provision within President Trump's newly passed legislative package introduces a federal tax exemption for tipped workers, but it comes with significant limitations. The new law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income, a cap that tax experts say will cover the majority of individuals in tipped occupations. This tax benefit is not permanent and is currently scheduled to phase out at the end of 2028 unless it is extended by a future act of Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a widespread and thriving trade in illegal cigarettes being sold openly in mini marts across the United Kingdom, particularly in cities like Hull. The report connects this illicit trade to international organized crime networks, people trafficking, and the use of illegal labor, which costs the UK billions in lost tax revenue. Experts note that underfunded Trading Standards departments are struggling to combat the problem, which is eroding public trust and contributing to urban decay.</p>

          <p>The successful passage of President Trump's landmark tax and spending bill was the result of intense political pressure, last-minute deal-making, and direct intervention from the president himself. Despite initial resistance from both moderate and fiscally conservative Republicans over issues like Medicaid cuts and the deficit, GOP leadership managed to secure the necessary votes. The process involved adding targeted benefits for specific states and holding a procedural vote open for seven hours to ensure passage by Trump's July Fourth deadline.</p>

The package allocates $45 billion for detention centers and another $30 billion for ICE personnel and operations, facilitating a move away from "catch and release" policies. The law also increases various immigration fees and restricts access to federal safety net programs like SNAP and Medicaid for many lawfully present immigrants.</p>
