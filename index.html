          <p>Crude oil futures increased by over 4% due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, fueled by President Trump's skepticism about reaching a nuclear deal. The U.S. is preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its Baghdad embassy, and the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Trump expressed diminishing confidence in a deal with Iran, while Iran's defense minister asserted that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of their military. These geopolitical factors have contributed to the rise in oil prices.</p>
