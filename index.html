        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Sean "Diddy" Combs' sexual assault trial continues, legal experts are offering insights into the impact of key witness testimonies. Witnesses, including Cassie Ventura's mother and former assistant, have corroborated Ventura's claims of abuse and coercion. However, the defense is exploiting inconsistencies in the testimonies to argue that the relationship was consensual, and that the charges are unsubstantiated. The jury has also heard from rapper Kid Cudi, who testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior, and male exotic dancer Sharay Hayes, who claimed his encounters with Cassie were consensual. (Note: This article contains information about sexual assault.)</p>

          <p>The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, has expressed concern over the increasing radicalization of young people by far-right ideologies, leading to the formation of groups involved in serious crimes. This warning follows a recent police crackdown on a far-right extremist cell with members as young as 14. In related news, train services at Hamburg's main station have resumed normal operations after a knife attack by a female suspect left 18 people injured, though police believe the suspect may have been in a state of mental distress.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers are set to open across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These walk-in clinics, staffed by specialists, will offer immediate care to individuals experiencing acute mental distress, with referrals also accepted from GPs and police. While NHS England hails the initiative as a pioneering model to provide the right support in the right setting, some experts express skepticism, calling for careful testing and improved funding for NHS mental health services.

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the need for a trade deal with the US based on mutual respect, following threats from former US President Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated the EU's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial agreement, warning they stand ready to defend their interests. Trump's remarks have sparked concern among European governments, who cautioned that higher tariffs would be detrimental to both sides, with some expressing hope for a negotiated resolution.</p>

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are facing difficult decisions about pregnancy, as contraceptive medication, a primary treatment for the condition, poses a dilemma for those wishing to conceive. Many women are hesitant to come off their medication due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts, with the average wait time for diagnosis being around 12 years. Experts are calling for more research into PMDD to provide women with more treatment options beyond the contraceptive pill. The Welsh government has pledged to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are putting retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and pressures related to housing and marriage.

While the Chinese government urges young people to plan early for retirement, many are focused on living well in the present.

Unlike previous generations, these 20-somethings are content with doing the bare minimum, clocking in and out on time, and not seeking promotions or praise. This shift is driven by a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation.

Koizumi also intends to explore online sales to ensure broader distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. to discuss potential collaboration.

While Germany emphasizes historical responsibility, it often ignores the entanglement of wealthy families with Nazi collaboration and forced labor. This includes the Herbert Quandt Media prize, named after an early SS supporter who profited from slave labor. The article argues that Germany's reckoning is embraced when it flatters the country's self-image but ignored when it threatens personal gain or broader strategic interests.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm struck a controversial deal with President Trump. The agreement, aimed at avoiding targeting by the federal government, involved auditing hiring practices and dedicating funds to pro bono legal services. The departures come after Trump had previously targeted the firm with an executive order. The move by the firm was controversial in the legal community, with some firms choosing to sue the administration instead.</p>
