        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a significant 9.1% year-on-year drop in May, a downturn attributed to weak domestic demand and the ongoing tariff dispute with the United States. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics highlighted steep declines in the mining and automotive sectors, which fell 29% and 11.9% respectively over the first five months of the year. Analysts note this reflects insufficient consumer demand and falling prices, signaling persistent economic headwinds for the nation's manufacturing and industrial base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent conflict between Iran and Israel has highlighted the vulnerability of global energy supplies, reinforcing the argument for transitioning to renewable energy sources. Experts suggest that homegrown renewables offer a stable and secure alternative to fossil fuels, which are often subject to price volatility and supply disruptions from geopolitical instability. While the green transition presents its own challenges, such as mineral dependency and grid stability, diversifying power with domestic wind and solar is seen as crucial for strengthening national and economic security.</p>

          <p>Following recent technical outages and staffing shortages, the debate over whether the U.S. should privatize its air traffic control system has re-emerged. While the Trump administration is currently focused on a multibillion-dollar investment to modernize the FAA, some critics argue that removing air traffic control from direct government oversight, similar to Canada's model, would improve efficiency. However, opponents express concerns that privatization could disadvantage smaller airports and note that other countries' privatized systems have faced their own challenges, including safety downgrades and funding issues.</p>

While an agreement to reduce these tariffs is expected by the end of June, the industry has faced a challenging year, with factory retooling for electric vehicles also contributing to the production slowdown.
