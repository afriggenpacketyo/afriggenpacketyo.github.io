          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is reportedly under fire, with sources indicating a lack of confidence from high-ranking officials despite President Trump's support. The controversy intensifies with the appointment of Andrew Bailey to a new power-sharing role and a lawsuit filed by former FBI officials alleging a political purge. Patel's communication missteps, particularly regarding the Charlie Kirk assassination, have drawn criticism, though the White House denies plans for his removal and his allies emphasize the FBI's recent successes in combating violent crime.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Salt Lake City, Utah, arrested two men suspected of placing an incendiary device under a news media vehicle. The device was lit but failed to detonate as designed, prompting a police and fire bomb squad response. A search warrant executed at a Magna home led to the arrests and the discovery of explosives, firearms, narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction. No motive or relationship between the 58-year-old and 31-year-old suspects has been publicly disclosed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that foreign workers are "welcome" in the United States, aiming to avoid disincentivizing investment, days after hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested in Georgia. The arrests occurred at an electric vehicle battery factory, with ICE alleging visa overstays or unauthorized manual labor. While the US opted against deportation, the incident caused alarm in South Korea. Trump clarified that temporary foreign experts are needed to teach Americans how to produce complex goods like semiconductors, expressing a desire to learn from and eventually surpass them.</p>

          <p>A growing number of car owners are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicle is worth, reaching a four-year high in the second quarter of 2025. This negative equity, averaging $6,754, complicates new car purchases as drivers must either pay the balance or roll it into a new loan. Experts advise consumers to research credit scores, seek pre-approvals, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance. Factors like longer loan terms and smaller down payments exacerbate the issue, making informed decisions crucial for buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American farmers, a historically loyal voting bloc for Donald Trump, are facing significant economic challenges due to the US-China trade war and resulting tariffs. Despite a sharp fall in Chinese crop orders and a five-year high in farm bankruptcies, many rural Americans, like Iowa farmer Tim Maxwell, remain supportive of the president. They express patience, believing tariffs will ultimately benefit them, and appreciate the administration's federal subsidies. Experts attribute this continued loyalty to a long-standing rural identity and a tendency towards "selective blame attribution" in a polarized political landscape.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has identified Charles Mwesigwa, an alleged former London bus driver, as the operator of a sex-trade ring in Dubai's glamorous neighborhoods, exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women. Women were reportedly lured with false promises of legitimate work, only to find themselves trapped by debt and forced into degrading sexual acts. The article details disturbing accounts, including extreme fetishes and alleged police inaction. Two women linked to Mwesigwa died after falling from high-rise apartments, with their families questioning the suicide rulings. Mwesigwa denies the allegations, claiming he merely helps women find accommodation and connects them with wealthy contacts.</p>

          <p>The UK and US are set to sign a landmark 'Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy' agreement, accelerating nuclear power development and promising thousands of jobs. This initiative, coinciding with President Trump's state visit, aims to streamline regulatory approvals and foster commercial partnerships. Key projects include a new advanced modular reactor plant in Hartlepool and data centers powered by small modular reactors in Nottinghamshire. The collaboration also seeks to end reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028, bolstering energy security and meeting growing global power demands, particularly for AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a popular two-term Republican governor of Illinois, passed away at 79 from complications related to pancreatic cancer. Credited with bringing greater financial stability to the state in the 1990s, Edgar was known for cutting the state budget and making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent. A moderate Republican, he grew uneasy with his party's shift to the right and notably supported Kamala Harris's presidential bid last year. Edgar remained a respected statesman and adviser after leaving office, remembered for his integrity and effective leadership.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's ongoing issues stem from player selection and positioning rather than manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation. Despite improvements in team compactness, individual errors in defensive situations are costing the team points. Murphy highlights Bruno Fernandes's struggles in a deeper midfield role, where his defensive instincts are lacking, and Luke Shaw's discomfort as a center-back. He suggests Amorim must recognize these miscast players and adjust personnel to prevent recurring mistakes, emphasizing that a player's intelligence should enable adaptation to new roles.</p>

Kim Jong Un's presence marked his return to the world stage, offering legitimacy to isolated regimes without requiring denuclearization. The event underscored a message that alignment with Beijing offers diplomatic lifelines and rehabilitation without needing reform, forming an "axis of the excluded" rejecting Western terms.</p>

Abdul recounts the heartbreaking loss of his wife and newborn when their local clinic, previously supported by USAID, was unexpectedly shut down. With a 50% increase in maternal mortality and a third in newborn deaths, the crisis is exacerbated by funding cuts to hospitals and the Taliban government's ban on women's higher education, including midwife training, severely restricting access to healthcare for half the population.</p>
