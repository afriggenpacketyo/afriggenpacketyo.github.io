          <p>Audio from a 911 call made by former NFL star John Elway has been released, detailing the moments after his agent, Jeff Sperbeck, fatally fell from a golf cart in La Quinta, California. In the call, Elway explains that Sperbeck fell from the back of the cart and sustained a head injury, clarifying that the cart did not crash. Authorities have ruled the death a tragic accident and closed the investigation, with no charges filed against Elway, who is reportedly devastated by the loss of his close friend and business partner.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called for the release of all government files related to Jeffrey Epstein's case, emphasizing the need for transparency while protecting the identities of victims. His stance marks a significant divergence from President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a politically motivated 'hoax' started by Democrats. Pence countered this, noting the investigation spanned multiple administrations and asserting that the American people deserve access to the facts surrounding the case.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska has been canceled after a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast, initially triggering a more severe tsunami warning. The quake, centered south of Sand Point, prompted evacuations to higher ground in some coastal communities, though officials stated that large, widespread waves were not expected. The event occurred in a seismically active region known as the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' but fortunately, there were no reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>

          <p>A massive data breach by the UK government, which exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans seeking relocation, has been publicly revealed following a High Court ruling. The leak occurred in 2022 when an official accidentally emailed a spreadsheet containing sensitive information, but the government suppressed knowledge of it with a super-injunction. In response, the UK covertly created a secret route to relocate those affected, with thousands already brought to the UK, though tens of thousands at risk were reportedly not offered relocation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has asked the UK government to intervene after UEFA demoted the Crystal Palace football club from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League. The demotion was a penalty for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also has a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified for the Europa League. The politicians called the punishment 'disproportionately punitive' and 'heart-breaking for fans,' questioning the fairness and transparency of UEFA's governance.</p>

          <p>Germany has agreed to pass new legislation by the end of the year to help crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The change will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK, closing a legal loophole. This new law is expected to make it easier for German authorities to take action against the storage and supply of small boats used for the dangerous crossings, a key part of a new UK-Germany cooperation agreement.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Festival Chapín de Los Angeles, a major annual Guatemalan cultural event, have postponed the festival from August to October due to widespread community fear surrounding recent ICE raids. The decision was made to ensure the safety and well-being of attendees, vendors, and staff, who might otherwise be afraid to gather in public. This follows the cancellation or postponement of several other community events in the Los Angeles area, highlighting the significant impact of aggressive immigration enforcement on local cultural life.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have observed the very beginning of planet formation around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from the Webb Space Telescope and other observatories, scientists detected minerals, specifically silicon monoxide, just starting to coalesce into the building blocks of planets. This discovery provides a rare glimpse into a process that mirrors how our own solar system likely began, offering valuable insights into the dawn of planetary systems.</p>

          <p>A legislative effort in Nebraska to lift a decades-old ban that denies government food assistance to people with drug convictions has narrowly failed. The policy is a remnant of the 'war on drugs' era, and while many states have since opted out of the federal ban, Nebraska remains one of the few that still enforces it. The failure to pass the reform means that individuals with past drug-related felony convictions in the state will continue to be ineligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p>

CEO Scott Kirby noted that the 'world is less uncertain' now than at the start of the year, when weaker-than-expected demand led to lower airfares. While domestic revenue per seat mile fell, premium cabin sales remained strong, and the airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year, signaling a positive outlook for the remainder of 2025.

          <p>Over 20 children have been placed in protective custody as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple who are the legal parents, many through surrogacy. The investigation began after an infant in their care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly caused by a nanny. Authorities discovered the large number of children, ranging from two months to 13 years old, and are now looking into whether the couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan, misled multiple surrogate mothers about their intention to have such a large family.</p>

          <p>In the bankruptcy case of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans, investors are arguing that nearly half of the 633 clergy abuse claims could be thrown out, potentially complicating a proposed settlement. The archdiocese has agreed to a settlement trust of at least $180 million, but the deal's approval hinges on a vote by the claimants. If hundreds of claims are invalidated for being filed late or for other technical reasons, it could empower a bloc of opposing victims to derail the entire settlement, forcing them to pursue their cases individually in civil court.</p>
