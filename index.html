          <p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara discusses ongoing efforts to reform the police department five years after George Floyd's murder, acknowledging the "open wound" Floyd's death left on the city. O'Hara emphasizes a focus on reducing crime while building community trust, adjusting arrest tactics, improving officer training, and restoring pride within the police force. Despite a shortage of officers and violent crime rates that have not improved as much as in other major cities, O'Hara remains committed to making a difference. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies, but O'Hara assures that reform efforts will continue in Minneapolis. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, deploying nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. Ukrainian officials reported that air defenses intercepted approximately two-thirds of the missiles and most of the drones. The attacks underscore the failure of cease-fire negotiations, with violence escalating and civilian casualties rising since February. Despite the intensified conflict, Russia and Ukraine completed a prisoner exchange, releasing 303 individuals on each side, marking the largest swap of the war so far. The relentless attacks and stalled negotiations reflect a grim outlook for the region. The optimism score is 15.</p>
