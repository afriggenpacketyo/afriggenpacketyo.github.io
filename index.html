          <p>The recent gathering of Asian powers in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) highlighted significant political and strategic intent but lacked a foundational economic agreement akin to the Bretton Woods system. This article argues that for the SCO's vision of a new world order to be realized, it must establish complex monetary and trade institutions. Without such a framework to support its cooperative pledges, the world risks further fragmentation into competing blocs, a challenge both Asian and Western nations must address.</p>

          <p>A significant fire occurred in a restaurant at the former BBC Television Centre in West London, prompting a large-scale response from the London Fire Brigade. Approximately 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines were dispatched to the nine-storey building, which now contains flats, studios, and restaurants. Residents were evacuated from their homes as a precaution, and authorities established a rest center for those affected. While the cause of the blaze is currently under investigation, there have been no reports of casualties.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. His coming-of-age ceremony places him second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and brings renewed attention to Japan's male-only succession laws. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, the Imperial Family faces a potential succession crisis. This event has reignited public and political debate over whether the rules should be changed to allow female succession, such as for the Emperor's daughter, Princess Aiko.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, but the occasion is shadowed by political tensions. Germany's far-right AfD party has criticized the centennial, labeling the movement's work as "globalist uniformity" and echoing historical condemnations by the Nazi party. The Bauhaus Dessau Foundation director notes the constant need to address these attacks, which have created security concerns for festival events. Despite the pressure, the centennial will proceed, focusing on the evolution of modern materials and the school's societal impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in Washington, D.C. to address crime has ignited a fierce political debate between congressional Democrats and Republicans. Democrats have condemned the move as an overreach, arguing it embarrasses the nation on the world stage, while Republicans contend it has made the city safer. The deployment follows the federalization of the local police force, a move D.C.'s attorney general is now challenging in court. The clash highlights the deep partisan divide over federal authority and local policing.</p>

          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's journey from being a sports-indifferent individual to a devoted Buffalo Bills fan after being introduced to the team by her Buffalonian boyfriend. The article explores how the team's identity is deeply intertwined with the city of Buffalo's own narrative of resilience, hard work, and underdog spirit. The author reflects on how rooting for a team, especially one with a history of near-successes, fosters a powerful sense of community and belonging. It illustrates that team allegiance can be a gifted connection that creates a sense of home, even from afar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, China's recent efforts to combat "involution"—destructive, low-quality price competition—are not expected to lead to major supply-side reforms on the scale seen in 2015. While President Xi Jinping has criticized this cutthroat competition, the current economic environment makes it difficult to implement significant production capacity cuts or introduce meaningful demand stimulus. The research firm suggests that expectations for a sweeping campaign to rebalance supply and demand may be misplaced, indicating a more challenging path ahead for China's economy.

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has unveiled a new, highly ambitious compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's total stock over a decade if he achieves aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. The proposal is seen as an incentive to retain Musk and focus his efforts on transforming Tesla into a leader in AI and robotics, though it has raised concerns about corporate governance.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's imposition of steep tariffs on Indian exports marks a significant setback for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's foreign policy. The move, framed as punishment for India's trade involving Russian oil, has shattered the illusion of a special relationship between the two leaders and exposed India's vulnerable position. The author contends that this reflects a broader shift in Western geopolitics, where protectionism and a transactional approach are becoming the norm. India must now navigate a more hostile world, learning hard lessons about its place outside the core Western alliance.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has reached the U.S. Open final after defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in a challenging four-set match. Sinner overcame a mid-match injury scare, requiring treatment on his stomach, but managed to regain control and secure the victory 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. The win makes him the youngest man in the Open era to reach all four major finals in a single season. This sets up a historic final against Carlos Alcaraz, continuing an era-defining rivalry that will also determine the year-end No. 1 ranking.</p>

          <p>In a significant speech, Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is expected to praise President Donald Trump as a "risk taker" whose political instincts reflect widespread anxieties in Western societies. The speech is seen as an attempt by the struggling UK Labour government to build bridges with the Trump administration and "Reform-proof" itself against the rise of Nigel Farage. Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates of Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for national renewal. In a notable shift, the former arch-remainer will also portray Brexit as an opportunity for closer US-UK ties.</p>

          <p>Yi Huiman, who served as the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) from 2019 to 2024, is now under investigation for "severe breaches of discipline." The probe was announced by the Communist Party's top anti-graft watchdog, continuing a long-running campaign against corruption that has increasingly targeted the financial sector. Yi is the second head of China's stock market regulator to be investigated for graft in the last decade. The investigation highlights the authorities' ongoing efforts to assert control and root out misconduct within the country's vast financial system.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko has intensified into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean and is tracking westward toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells from the storm could generate life-threatening surf and rip currents for the islands by the end of the weekend. The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, is expected to bring the potential for heavy rainfall and flooding to Hawaii early next week. In response, the acting governor has declared a state of emergency to prepare for the storm's possible impact.</p>

Major medical organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists maintain there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship.

          <p>China is leveraging its party-to-party diplomatic channels as President Xi Jinping recently met with leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties. These interactions, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, are a key component of China's foreign policy strategy, distinct from traditional state-level relations. While Beijing is not promoting a global communist movement, this form of diplomacy helps build connections and influence with like-minded ruling parties. The department has established ties with over 600 political parties globally, serving as an increasingly active diplomatic tool.</p>

The action has prompted a diplomatic response from South Korea, which has called for its citizens' rights to be respected.
