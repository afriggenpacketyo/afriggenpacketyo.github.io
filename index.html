          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart saw its shares fall significantly despite forecasting a substantial increase in profit and revenue for the first half of 2025. This market reaction is attributed by analysts to investor concerns that the company's explosive growth, driven by popular characters like Labubu, may have peaked and could slow in the second half of the year. Despite the stock pullback and one analyst's view that shares are overvalued, many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the brand, citing its strong overseas expansion and growing global recognition.

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported second-quarter earnings and net bookings that surpassed analyst expectations. The company, which is a critical supplier to global chipmakers like Intel and TSMC, posted net sales of 7.7 billion euros and net bookings of 5.5 billion euros, a key indicator of future demand. ASML is the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines necessary for manufacturing the world's most advanced chips. The strong performance comes as the company navigates market uncertainty related to U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Trump's Shift on Ukraine Is Driven by NATO Financial Commitments</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that President Trump's recent change in stance towards supporting Ukraine, including supplying anti-missile systems, is not due to strategic enlightenment but rather a transactional response to European financial commitments. The author argues that NATO members pledging to increase defense spending and directly purchasing Patriot missile systems for Kyiv has convinced Trump that Europe is paying its share. This shift is viewed as a pragmatic move where financial assurances from allies have proven more persuasive than Russian diplomacy, though the long-term reliability of this support remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at a supply chain expo in Beijing, lauded several Chinese generative AI models as "world class," highlighting their role in spurring global AI development. His praise comes as Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, following assurances from the U.S. government. Huang emphasized the significant number of Chinese developers using Nvidia's platform and warned that U.S. export restrictions could inadvertently benefit competitors like Huawei. This development signals a potential easing of tech trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly advanced a White House request to cancel approximately $9 billion in previously approved spending, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The legislation, which now returns to the House, primarily targets foreign aid programs and would effectively eliminate federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. While most Republicans supported the measure as a step toward fiscal responsibility, it faced opposition from all Democrats and three Republicans who raised concerns about its impact on global health initiatives and local media.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain her past comments about reviewing a Jeffrey Epstein "client list," a claim the Justice Department has since refuted. This comes amid growing pressure from other Republican lawmakers, including calls for Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress. The push for transparency highlights a rare point of friction between the Trump administration and some of its key congressional allies over the high-profile case. Johnson stated that while he trusts the president, Bondi needs to provide an explanation.</p>

          <p>The White House reportedly delivered an ultimatum to the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the nation's largest public utility, demanding the firing of its CEO, Don Moul. The board has so far resisted the order. This directive follows public opposition from country music star John Rich to a proposed TVA gas plant near Nashville, which caught President Trump's attention. Sources suggest the move may be a pretext for the administration to install a more allied CEO and potentially pursue the long-debated privatization of the government-owned utility.</p>

          <p>As Congress considers the GENIUS Act, this article explains the function and significance of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan bill aims to create a clear regulatory framework for the $250 billion market, establishing consumer protections and rules for issuers like banks and credit unions. Proponents argue that stablecoins, described as "digital dollars," enable faster and cheaper financial transactions. However, they carry risks, such as the potential to "depeg" from their underlying asset during market volatility, as seen during the 2023 bank failures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a formal investigation into what it calls Brazil's "unfair" trading practices, at the direction of the president. The probe will examine Brazil's policies on digital trade, preferential tariffs for other partners, and alleged interference with U.S. social media companies over political speech censorship. This move escalates trade tensions following Trump's recent threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, to which President Lula da Silva said Brazil would respond in kind.

The piece argues that tailored local laws can create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively within a rule-of-law framework. This reflects a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal mechanisms to address economic issues. The power for more cities to draft their own laws was expanded in 2015 to better address local development and environmental needs.</p>

After Bondi stated there was no evidence of a "client list," figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson called for more transparency. Trump, while calling for the release of credible information, also questioned the continued fascination with what he described as a "sordid but boring" case.</p>
