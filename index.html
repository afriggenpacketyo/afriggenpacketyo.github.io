          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:53:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is closing its artificial intelligence research lab in Shanghai as part of broader cost-cutting measures and strategic adjustments. An Amazon scientist attributed the decision to ongoing U.S.-China geopolitical tensions, which have prompted many American companies to reduce their presence in China. The closure follows recent layoffs at Amazon Web Services and is part of a larger trend of the company scaling back its Chinese operations, including the discontinuation of its Kindle e-book store and e-commerce marketplace in previous years. This move reflects the challenging environment for U.S. tech firms in China, compounded by U.S. restrictions on AI-related technology exports.</p>

          <p>Dylan Mortensen, one of the surviving roommates in the 2022 University of Idaho murders, spoke publicly for the first time at Bryan Kohberger's sentencing. In a deeply emotional victim impact statement, she described the profound and lasting trauma the attack has caused, including debilitating panic attacks and a shattered sense of safety. Mortensen stated that while Kohberger took her friends and her ability to trust, he could not take her voice or her memories. The other surviving roommate, Bethany Funke, also had a statement read, detailing her survivor's guilt and the harassment she faced after the murders.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of the case against former ballerina Ashley Benefield, who was convicted of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. It details their whirlwind romance, turbulent marriage, and the contentious custody battle over their daughter, which prosecutors argued was the motive for the killing. The piece explores Benefield's claim of self-defense, alleging a history of abuse, contrasted with the prosecution's portrayal of her as a manipulator. Ultimately, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a conclusion to a case that drew significant media attention.</p>

          <p>Boston Red Sox pitcher Lucas Giolito has publicly voiced his concerns over the increasing harassment and threats players face from disgruntled sports bettors. He revealed that both he and his girlfriend receive abusive social media messages, linking the uptick to the growing accessibility of sports gambling. Giolito discussed the issue directly with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, questioning if a player would need to be physically assaulted before significant action is taken. The article highlights that this is a growing problem, citing a similar incident where Houston Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. received death threats from a bettor.</p>

          <p>Germany is considering the reintroduction of compulsory military service in response to growing security threats in Europe, a proposal championed by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. The plan would initially involve conscripting around 5,000 young adults annually, with the potential for expansion. However, the Confederation of German Employers' Associations has raised concerns that this could harm the economy by delaying young people's entry into the workforce. Economists are divided, with some arguing the impact would be minimal with small numbers, while others suggest it could exacerbate skilled labor shortages, though it might also provide vocational training.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea for the murder of four University of Idaho students, the central question of his motive remains unanswered, leaving the public and victims' families without a full explanation.

It examines the evidence that led to the plea deal, including overwhelming DNA and cell phone data, and discusses the various media projects attempting to piece together Kohberger's psychology. While speculation points to an obsession with one of the victims, the plea agreement means Kohberger's direct reasons may be forever sealed.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Genetic Modification to Block Malaria Transmission in Mosquitoes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:02:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to make mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single, precise change to their genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology. The study, published in Nature, found that altering one amino acid in the FREP1 gene largely prevents the malaria parasite from completing its journey to the mosquito's salivary glands. Scientists believe this genetic tweak could be spread through a wild mosquito population using a gene drive, which forces the trait to be inherited by nearly all offspring. While the approach is still in early stages, it represents a promising new tool in the global fight against malaria.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has joined Spanish club Barcelona on a season-long loan, with an option for a permanent transfer. The 27-year-old England international, who has been with United since his youth, expressed his excitement about the move, calling Barcelona a "club where people's dreams come true." The transfer follows a difficult period for Rashford at his boyhood club, where he fell out of favor with manager Ruben Amorim and spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa. The move is expected to provide significant wage bill savings for Manchester United.</p>

The recall campaign was initiated by civic groups who accuse the KMT lawmakers of being too close to Beijing.

In return, Japan has agreed to open its markets to certain U.S. agricultural products and will reportedly invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal was celebrated by leaders in both countries and caused a surge in the stock prices of major Japanese automakers like Toyota and Honda. (not investment advice)</p>

The article also highlights a significant positive market mover, GE Vernova, which soared after a strong earnings report driven by high demand for its power-generating turbines, essential for the AI industry's growth.
