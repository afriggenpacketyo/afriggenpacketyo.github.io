        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bill Simon, Walmart's former U.S. CEO, believes the retailer is strong enough to absorb tariff costs without raising prices, contradicting the company's 'doom and gloom' commentary. Simon points to Walmart's increased gross profit margin and price deflation in general merchandise categories as evidence of its ability to manage tariff impacts. He suggests that corporate executives' negative commentary could erode consumer confidence, especially given a steady job market and cheaper fuel prices. Simon is currently on the Darden Restaurants board and is the chairman at Hanesbrands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 9Â½-month-old boy named KJ has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment for CPS1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder affecting one in 1.3 million babies. Doctors at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to fix KJ's specific mutation, potentially preventing severe mental and developmental delays, and a possible liver transplant. The treatment, which involves pinpoint targeting using CRISPR technology, offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare and could eventually be used for more common genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. The treatment's rapid development was possible through federal funding for basic research and collaboration between multiple institutions.</p>

          <p>Japan's real GDP experienced a decrease of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, specifically from January to March, according to a report by Kyodo News.

          <p>World's top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler voiced his disagreement with the PGA of America's decision not to implement 'lift, clean, place' rule for the first round of the PGA Championship, citing unfair conditions due to rain-soaked course. Scheffler argued that hitting the ball in the fairway should not result in punishment due to mud on the ball, which significantly impacts control and distance. He acknowledged the purist perspective but emphasized the importance of a fair test of golf, where skill is not compromised by chance. Despite the setback, Scheffler finished the day 2-under par, while Ryan Gerard led the leaderboard.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are considering a new security pact to enhance cooperation on defense, economic security, infrastructure, energy, migration, and transnational crime, marking a potential shift in relations post-Brexit. This initiative, spearheaded by the Labour government, aims to establish regular interactions with the EU, including a summit on May 19 to launch a new partnership. While proponents argue it will complement NATO and boost the UK economy by allowing access to EU defense funding, critics fear it could undermine British sovereignty and constrain its military structure. The agreement also explores a 'veterinary' deal to ease border checks on food and drink, though this raises concerns about aligning with EU regulations and oversight.</p>

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial, Cassie Ventura faced intense cross-examination as defense attorneys presented archived text messages to challenge her claims of coercion and portray her as a willing participant in Combs' lifestyle. The defense highlighted messages showing Ventura's affection for Combs and her apparent enthusiasm for 'freak-offs,' drug-fueled orgies. Ventura acknowledged her love for Combs but maintained that his behavior changed over time, becoming violent and controlling. The trial also touched on jealousy and infidelity within their relationship, with both parties expressing anger over each other's actions. Ventura's testimony is expected to conclude soon, considering her pregnancy.</p>

          <p>New federal requirements for clinical testing of vaccines may delay the availability of updated Covid and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may qualify as 'new products,' requiring additional clinical evaluation. F.D.A. officials are seeking more clinical data before approving Novavax's Covid vaccine. Concerns have also been raised about Covid's impact on children, possibly leading to an end to the vaccine's use in that age group. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader effort to undermine confidence in all vaccines.</p>

          <p>Glen Rogers, a suspected serial killer once considered for a possible link to the O.J. Simpson case, was executed in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs. Rogers was convicted of robbing and killing Cribbs, fleeing the state before being apprehended in Kentucky. The execution followed decades of failed appeals, including a recent claim of repressed memories of sexual abuse. Rogers also received a death sentence in California for the murder of Sandra Gallagher. He was linked to multiple other slayings across the U.S. and was the subject of a 2012 documentary that explored his possible involvement in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders.</p>

          <p>Washington is facing increasing scrutiny over 'debanking,' the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions or perceived risks. While there is bipartisan agreement that debanking is a problem, there is no consensus on how to address it. Accusations of politically motivated discrimination have come from conservative and religious groups, the Trump Organization, and cryptocurrency companies, while liberal lawmakers are speaking out for individuals and small businesses. The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to address the issue, but legal and regulatory challenges remain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's agreements to sell advanced AI chips to the UAE and Saudi Arabia have caused internal divisions over whether the U.S. is outsourcing the industry of the future. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies, others fear they lack adequate protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China. The deals involve delivering hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips annually to build data center hubs in the Middle East. Critics argue that these deals could lead to the worldâ€™s biggest data centers being located outside the U.S., affecting jobs, tax revenue, and U.S. influence.</p>

Executives said goods including vegetables and furniture will see a price jump, with car seats potentially increasing by $100. Other companies, like Procter & Gamble and Ford, have also announced price increases. Mattel, the maker of Barbie, also stated it would have to boost prices, prompting a threat from Trump to impose a 100% tariff.

          <p>A new study suggests that moderate amounts of zinc can help slow down aging, while too much zinc can increase the speed of aging. Researchers found that adding exercise may enhance the effects of zinc. One of these anti-inflammatory nutrients is zinc, an essential trace mineral that you must get from food or supplements since the body does not make it on its own. While you donâ€™t need a lot of zinc each day, this antioxidant-acting mineral plays an important role in supporting DNA, wound healing and immunityâ€”all things that influence aging.</p>
