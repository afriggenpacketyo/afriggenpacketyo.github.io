        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican-backed spending bill is causing concern among Wall Street experts due to its potential to increase the U.S. debt and deficit. The article highlights that Moody's recently downgraded U.S. debt, citing unresolved fiscal deficits and growing interest costs, exacerbating market instability. This has led to a surge in Treasury yields as investors demand higher compensation for holding U.S. debt. Experts like Kathy Jones from Charles Schwab and Matthew Luzzetti from Deutsche Bank express concern over the long-term implications for debt-to-GDP stability if deficits are not addressed.

          <p>President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa met to discuss claims of a "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa, allegations which have been denied by Ramaphosa and South African courts. Despite these denials, the Trump administration has doubled down on these claims, releasing a statement with press clippings supporting their position. The article notes that dozens of Afrikaner refugees have arrived in the U.S. after being fast-tracked under an executive order issued by Trump in February, which contends that the South African government is seizing Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation.</p>
