          <p>Tina Louise, best known for her role as Ginger Grant on 'Gilligan's Island,' has released the audio version of her memoir, 'Sunday: A Memoir,' where she candidly discusses her troubled childhood marked by loneliness and anger due to being sent to boarding school at a young age and feeling abandoned by her parents. She recounts instances of mistreatment and isolation, including being bullied, physically punished, and deprived of comfort items, which led to a complicated relationship with her mother and a search for her father later in life. Despite the hardships, Louise found solace in acting and eventually achieved stardom, though she notes that the 'Gilligan's Island' cast did not receive residuals from the show's success. She now finds joy in tutoring students and giving them hope.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led Senate passed a budget resolution, a crucial step towards enacting President Trump's domestic agenda, which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on border security and defense. The plan allows for over $5 trillion in tax cuts and raises the debt limit by $5 trillion to avoid a potential financial default. However, disagreements remain between the House and Senate Republicans on how to pay for these tax cuts, particularly regarding spending cuts to programs like Medicaid, creating potential obstacles to the final passage of the budget.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of 10% tariffs on all U.S. trading partners triggered significant economic, market, and geopolitical disruption, leading to a sharp sell-off in the stock market. The move prompted retaliatory tariffs from China and potential countermeasures from the European Union, raising concerns about a global trade war. Economists criticized the rudimentary math behind the tariffs, and investors responded by selling stocks, resulting in a substantial loss in market value. While Trump expressed optimism about potential deals, the Federal Reserve indicated that the tariffs would likely dent growth and boost inflation, further unsettling investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study in Wales suggests that older adults who received the shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia over a seven-year period compared to those who did not receive the vaccine. Researchers believe the protective effect may be related to the vaccine's ability to prevent inflammation around nerve cells, which is increasingly recognized as a factor in cognitive decline. The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that viral infections may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, potentially opening new avenues for preventive treatments. Further research, including randomized control trials, is underway to explore the potential of antiviral treatments for dementia. </p>

          <p>China's Foreign Ministry responded to the U.S. imposition of new tariffs by stating that "the market has spoken," referencing the sharp decline in U.S. stock markets. The ministry spokesperson called the trade and tariff war "unprovoked and unjustified" and urged the White House to resolve differences through consultation. China's Finance Ministry also announced a 34% tariff on all goods imported from the U.S., escalating investor fears of economic risks. The statement underscores the growing tensions between the two countries and the potential for further economic disruption.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 10% tariff on imports has come into effect, marking a significant shift in global trade. The move has prompted international concern, with Prime Minister Starmer engaging with foreign leaders to discuss potential responses. Experts predict that the tariffs will evolve as countries negotiate lower rates, but the initial impact has been substantial, shaking global stock markets and raising concerns about economic damage. The UK government is consulting with businesses to assess the impact and determine appropriate countermeasures.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece criticizes the ban on flying Pride flags over U.S. embassies, arguing that it sends a message of exclusion to LGBTQ+ individuals seeking refuge from persecution. The author highlights the plight of LGBTQ+ refugees and argues that the ban undermines the U.S.'s historical role as a beacon of hope and acceptance. The piece contrasts the U.S.'s actions with countries like Russia, where LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly restricted, and concludes that the ban damages the country's reputation as a welcoming place for the persecuted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's environmental policies, including regulatory rollbacks and budget cuts, are projected to have significant negative consequences for public health and the economy. Reports from environmental watchdog groups indicate that these actions could lead to increased premature deaths, asthma attacks, and healthcare costs. Critics argue that the administration's claims of easing regulatory burdens are contradicted by the potential for substantial harm to Americans' well-being and financial stability. The long-term effects of these environmental changes are a major concern for public health advocates and environmental organizations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on imports from various countries, including China, Vietnam, and India, could significantly increase the cost of Apple's iPhone and other consumer electronics. Apple relies on a global supply chain, with most iPhones manufactured in China, making the company vulnerable to the new tariffs. Experts say that Apple's tariffs could make Apple's iPhone more expensive. The tariffs could cause consumers to pay as much as $2,500 more for an iPhone, which costs roughly $1,000, depending on the model. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Los Angeles' Measure ULA, a transfer tax on high-value properties, needs reform due to its negative effects on housing and the economy. The authors point out that the tax applies to various properties, not just mansions, and is based on sale price rather than profit, creating disincentives for sales and new construction. They propose state legislation to reduce ULA's negative effects, such as restricting the tax to single-family homes or adopting marginal rates. The piece emphasizes the need for policies that balance revenue generation with encouraging housing and job creation.</p>

          <p>Burmese pythons, an invasive species in Florida, are adapting to new environments and expanding their territory beyond the Everglades. Studies and sightings indicate that the snakes have crossbred with other python species and developed a tolerance to colder temperatures. The snakes have killed almost all of the native species in the everglades. The Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission is encouraging residents to report sightings and is actively working to remove pythons from the ecosystem, but their population is estimated to be in the tens of thousands and is growing.</p>
