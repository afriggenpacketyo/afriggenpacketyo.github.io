          <p>The U.S. has conducted another strike on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea, allegedly operated by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and suspected of trafficking drugs. According to the Defense Secretary, the nighttime operation in international waters resulted in the deaths of all six men on board. This marks the tenth such strike in a broader, and controversial, counter-narcotics campaign that has now caused over 40 fatalities. The operations have drawn criticism from foreign governments and U.S. lawmakers over their legality and strategic rationale.</p>

          <p>Police have launched a major manhunt for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been jailed for 12 months for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex. Instead of being transferred to an immigration detention center for deportation, he was erroneously set free, prompting an urgent investigation by the Prison Service. Authorities have confirmed he boarded a train to London, and the Justice Secretary has expressed his outrage over the error.</p>

          <p>A German company that manufactures furniture lifts has turned its product's role in a major crime into a marketing opportunity. After thieves used one of its Böcker Agilo lifts to execute a $102 million jewel heist at the Louvre Museum, the company launched a humorous ad campaign. The ad features a photo of the machine outside the museum with the tagline, "If you're in a hurry." While the company condemns the robbery, it decided to embrace the publicity, which has generated millions of views on social media.</p>

          <h2>Trump's East Wing Demolition Seen as a Metaphor for His Presidency's Approach to Tradition</h2>

          <p>An article in The Economist frames the recent demolition of the White House East Wing and its historic gardens as a parable of the Trump presidency. The construction of a new ballroom at the expense of established landmarks is presented as a physical manifestation of the administration's broader disregard for historical norms and traditions. The East Wing has served as the office space and operational center for America's first ladies since Rosalynn Carter established the practice in 1977, making its removal a symbolic act.</p>

          <p>The British government is implementing major changes to the Windrush Compensation scheme to accelerate justice for victims of the immigration scandal. Under the new rules, claimants will receive 75% of their compensation offer upfront while awaiting review, and for the first time, claims can be made for lost pension contributions. The overhaul addresses years of intense criticism over processing delays and inadequate payouts to the thousands of Caribbean migrants who were wrongly denied their legal rights in the UK.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Deng Chol Majek, an asylum seeker from Sudan, guilty of the murder of 27-year-old hotel worker Rhiannon Whyte. Majek stalked Whyte from the hotel where she worked to the nearby Bescot Stadium train station, where he stabbed her 23 times with a screwdriver in an unprovoked attack. Despite clear CCTV and DNA evidence linking him to the crime, Majek denied his involvement, and no motive for the brutal killing has been established. He was later seen dancing in the hotel car park as emergency services attended the scene.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out an income tax rise in next month's Budget, sparking speculation that the Labour government might break a key election manifesto pledge. Facing a £22 billion shortfall in public finances, the Treasury is reportedly in active discussions about raising revenue, potentially by adding to the basic rate of income tax. While Reeves stated her goal is to keep taxes for working people "as low as possible," her noncommittal language contrasts sharply with previous promises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors has laid off more than 200 salaried employees as part of its ongoing efforts to cut costs and restructure its business operations. The affected workers were primarily Computer-Aided Design (CAD) engineers based at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit. GM stated that the move was intended to strengthen its core architectural design capabilities. The layoffs continue a trend of reducing white-collar staff at the automaker, occurring just days after it raised its financial guidance for the year.</p>

          <p>In a historic political upset, the Labour Party has lost the Welsh Parliament seat of Caerphilly for the first time in 100 years. Plaid Cymru candidate Lindsay Whittle secured a decisive victory with a 27% swing from Labour, a result described as "momentous" by the Welsh nationalist party's leader. The defeat is a significant blow to both the Welsh Labour government and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who acknowledged the party must "reflect and regroup" after the deeply disappointing outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting in 2025, a significant change in IRS regulations will affect many non-spouse beneficiaries who have inherited an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Those subject to the "10-year rule" must now begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) if the original account owner had already reached RMD age before their death. Failing to take these yearly withdrawals can result in a steep IRS penalty of up to 25% of the amount that should have been withdrawn, necessitating careful tax planning for heirs.

          <p>Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges she misrepresented her intended use of a property in Virginia to obtain a mortgage with more favorable terms. Outside the courthouse, James accused former President Trump of using the justice system for "retribution" against his political opponents, linking her prosecution to the civil fraud case she successfully brought against him and his company.</p>
