          <p>A new six-episode historical documentary, “Zuo Zongtang Recovers Xinjiang,” has been released in China, aiming to reinforce Beijing's narrative on the region's history. Produced in Hunan province, the series focuses on a 19th-century Qing dynasty general who suppressed a separatist state in Xinjiang. This media initiative aligns with President Xi Jinping's goal of forging a strong, unified national identity by cementing China's historical claims over its border territories. The documentary frames the historical conflict as a fight against foreign-backed separatism and Islamic fundamentalism, countering narratives prevalent in the West.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is showing encouraging signs of recovery after participating in his first extensive workout since being sidelined with a back injury. Coach Sean McVay reported that Stafford threw over 60 passes without limitations, covering short, intermediate, and deep routes, and felt good afterward. While the 37-year-old quarterback is not yet fully cleared for all team activities, this workout is considered a significant step toward his return to practice. The team remains hopeful for his swift return as he works through an aggravated disc issue.</p>

          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, star receiver CeeDee Lamb was inadvertently leveled by a sprinting official on the sideline. Lamb, who was not playing in the game and was dressed in street clothes, was standing near the field when the official, focused on the play, ran into his back. The collision resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Cowboys for making contact with an official. Lamb appeared uninjured and was seen laughing about the unusual incident with his teammates.</p>

          <p>A jury has found Matthew Ecker guilty of second-degree murder in the 2022 death of his ex-girlfriend, 32-year-old nurse Alex Pennig. Ecker had initially claimed Pennig took her own life in her bathroom, but investigators found inconsistencies in his story. A key piece of evidence was a small metal part from the door lock found under Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before the shot was fired. The prosecution argued Ecker, who was married, killed Pennig to keep their affair quiet, while the defense maintained it was a suicide, pointing to her history of depression.</p>

          <p>After a period of significant growth, the Kentucky bourbon industry is experiencing a slowdown due to a combination of economic pressures. Factors contributing to the decline include shifting consumer habits, with Gen-Z drinking less, and post-pandemic inflation pushing drinkers toward cheaper alternatives. The situation has been exacerbated by global trade disputes, particularly retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada, which have sharply reduced exports. This downturn has led to an oversupply of bourbon, causing financial distress for some distilleries and resulting in bankruptcies and plant closures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a social media debate about identity and heritage. Despite being born and raised in England, Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish passport, defended his connection to the country where his musical tastes were formed. This article explores the complex and evolving nature of what it means to be Irish in 2025, touching on the experiences of the diaspora, the blended identities in Northern Ireland, and the cross-cultural influences that shape modern identity beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship.</p>

          <p>The government of Niger is investigating the legality of the export and sale of a massive meteorite from Mars, which was discovered in the Sahara Desert and recently sold for $4.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The 24.7kg rock, the largest Martian meteorite ever found on Earth, was reportedly sold by a local community to an international dealer before making its way to the US. While Sotheby's maintains all procedures were followed, Nigerien officials and heritage advocates argue that the artifact is part of the nation's heritage and its removal may have violated international and local laws.</p>

          <h2>New 'War of the Worlds' Film's Poor Reviews Spark Discussion on the Appeal of 'Bad' Movies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new adaptation of "War of the Worlds," starring Ice Cube, has been widely panned by critics, earning a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes upon its release. However, the overwhelmingly negative reviews have paradoxically generated interest, sparking a conversation about why audiences are often drawn to films that are considered "so bad they're good." Film enthusiasts and cultural commentators suggest that truly terrible movies can be more entertaining and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. They find charm in earnest failures and the visible struggle to overcome production issues, which can offer a unique and often humorous viewing experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the tech landscape, despite dropping from the headlines. The app's initial success challenged the American-led assumption that bigger and more expensive AI models were inherently better, proving that smarter engineering could yield powerful results at a fraction of the cost. This has prompted a shift in the industry toward developing smaller, more efficient models, as seen in recent releases from major players like OpenAI. However, concerns about data security and DeepSeek's ties to the Chinese government persist, and the rivalry to establish AI dominance continues to intensify.</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer, reportedly believed the COVID-19 vaccine had made him depressed and suicidal.

The shooting resulted in the death of Officer David Rose and the suspect himself, and caused damage to at least four CDC buildings.

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following controversy over a sandal design created in collaboration with Adidas. The Mexican government and authorities in the state of Oaxaca complained that the "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe culturally appropriated a traditional sandal design, known as a huarache, unique to the region. In response to accusations of profiting from collective intellectual property, Chavarria expressed deep regret for not partnering directly with the Oaxacan community. Adidas has also acknowledged the criticism and stated it is seeking to meet with local officials to repair the damage.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance by CEO Tim Cook, who announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, which pleased President Trump, was seen by investors as a successful strategy to mitigate the financial risks of potential tariffs on imported components. The positive market reaction was also bolstered by Apple's strong quarterly earnings report from two weeks prior. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin has acknowledged that there is "no quick fix" for the team's recurring problems after a disappointing start to the Scottish Premiership season. Despite a strong performance in a Champions League qualifier, Rangers were booed by fans after a lackluster draw against Dundee, a pattern of inconsistent results that also plagued previous managers. Martin pointed to a need for a deeper cultural change at the club, emphasizing that improving standards and mentality will take time. The team is already trailing rival Celtic in the league standings.</p>

          <p>British police arrested 365 people in central London during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a pro-Palestinian group recently banned by the government. Supporters intentionally violated the new law, which criminalizes public support for the organization, as a form of civil disobedience to challenge the ban. The government outlawed Palestine Action after its activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel's actions in Gaza. Protest organizers argue the law illegally restricts freedom of expression and aimed to overwhelm the justice system with mass arrests.</p>
