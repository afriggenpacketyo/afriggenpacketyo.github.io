          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching a deal with Pakistani authorities. The agreement addresses key demands from demonstrators, including cheaper wheat and reduced electricity tariffs, bringing an end to demonstrations that resulted in the deaths of at least ten people, including three police officers. The alliance leader expressed gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues, though leaders remain hopeful that this deal will be implemented more successfully than previous unfulfilled promises from last year's protests.</p>

          <p>The NFL's Buffalo Bills have drawn sharp criticism from their fanbase after posting a social media message of good luck to the Toronto Blue Jays ahead of their MLB postseason series against the New York Yankees. Many fans argued the gesture was a betrayal of the team's New York identity, questioning their affiliation with the state. The controversy highlights the unique geographical and cultural position of Buffalo, which is much closer to Toronto than New York City, sparking a debate about regional loyalties in professional sports.</p>

The attacker, who was shot and killed by police, drove a car into people before attempting to enter the synagogue. Authorities have since arrested six individuals on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses and are questioning their connection to the attacker, who was recently bailed after being arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has detailed the development of new unmanned underwater systems designed for stealth and integrated combat operations. The systems reportedly operate below 90 decibels to evade sonar detection and can be combined with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to form a comprehensive, multilayered strike network. The disclosure points to significant advancements in the PLA Navy's unmanned warfare capabilities and its focus on developing intelligent and disruptive sub-surface military technologies for future conflicts.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown has left the national park system in a state of limbo, with many sites remaining partially open but with minimal staff. This situation has created widespread confusion for visitors and raised serious concerns about public safety, environmental damage from unmanaged waste, and poaching, echoing problems from the 2018 shutdown. The partial accessibility without full services also threatens the local gateway communities whose economies depend heavily on the millions of dollars in daily visitor spending.</p>

          <p>A significant drop in international student enrollment, exacerbated by Trump administration policies and visa crackdowns, is causing severe economic strain in small American college towns. These communities, like Oxford, Ohio, and West Lafayette, Indiana, rely heavily on the revenue from foreign students, who typically pay full tuition and support local businesses. The decline represents a potential loss of billions of dollars nationwide and threatens not only university finances but also the economic stability and cultural diversity of these towns.</p>

          <p>The Urenco uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only commercial plant of its kind in the US, is ramping up production to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This push is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a new ban on Russian uranium imports, which previously supplied a significant portion of US fuel. The plant's expansion is a critical part of the US strategy to build out a domestic nuclear supply chain, though bottlenecks in other areas like uranium conversion remain a challenge.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the long-held belief in the enduring value of a prestigious college brand is weakening among American families. As tuition soars and the job market tightens, parents and students are increasingly prioritizing practical considerations like cost, career outcomes, and hands-on learning opportunities over mere reputation. This shift is causing a reevaluation of what makes a "good" college, with many families opting for less-ranked schools that offer better financial aid or specific programs, leading to more fluidity in the traditional college hierarchy.</p>
