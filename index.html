          <p>The Trump administration's plan to revoke the EPA's authority to regulate climate pollution, based on its "endangerment finding," poses significant risks for corporations. This move, potentially one of the largest deregulatory actions, is opposed by many businesses and environmental lawyers who prefer federal standards for predictability and legal protection. Critics argue the proposal contradicts scientific consensus and could invite more lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, creating an uncertain regulatory environment.</p>

The initiative aims to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, reflecting a broader interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries, despite Trump's previous criticisms of the CHIPS Act.

          <p>Helsinki, Finland, a city of nearly 690,000 people, has achieved zero traffic fatalities in the past year, aligning with the EU's "Vision Zero" program. This success is attributed to measures like reducing speed limits to 30 kmph on over half of its streets and around schools. The city's Traffic Safety Development Programme focuses on infrastructure improvements, increased public transport, and data-driven planning. This achievement serves as a model for other medium-sized cities globally.</p>
