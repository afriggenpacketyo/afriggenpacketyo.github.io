          <p>A fire at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol, a maternity hospital, prompted the evacuation of pregnant women and babies. The fire, which broke out on the roof and damaged solar panels, was later extinguished by firefighters.  Partners were asked to leave the building during the evacuation, while some women were moved to the Bristol University Life Sciences building. An investigation into the cause of the fire is underway, and the public was asked to avoid the area during the incident.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has initiated a nationwide effort to arrest illegal immigrants at their immigration and asylum hearings. The policy targets individuals who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, leading to a likely increase in deportations for those who have not committed crimes beyond illegally crossing the border. The DHS strategy involves dropping the migrants' immigration cases to facilitate expedited removal proceedings. This initiative contrasts with the Trump administration's focus on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has blocked President Trump’s executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, ordering officials to reinstate thousands of fired employees. Judge Myong J. Joun issued a preliminary injunction, siding with school districts and teachers who argued the actions equated to an illegal shutdown of the agency.  The ruling is a setback for the administration's efforts to reorganize the department, with officials vowing to challenge the decision. The judge previously ordered the administration to release teacher-training grants that had been suspended.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a split 4-4 ruling, blocked a bid to establish the nation’s first taxpayer-funded religious charter school in Oklahoma. The ruling upholds a lower court’s decision that the proposed St Isidore of Seville Catholic virtual school would violate the constitutional separation of church and state. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leading to the even division.

The bill also requires both parents to have a Social Security number when filing jointly, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present.

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state law that regulates air pollution monitoring, arguing it violates their constitutional rights. The law requires groups alleging environmental violations to use federally-approved equipment and sets restrictions on data analysis and sharing. The groups claim the law stifles their ability to detect and report toxic pollution from refineries and chemical plants, particularly in the industrial corridor known as Cancer Alley. The state Attorney General has vowed to fight the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>With tax season over, many people may still be facing tax debt-related stress and should consider seeking help from a tax relief specialist. Before working with a specialist, it's important to ask the right questions, such as what tax relief options are available based on their situation, whether IRS collections can be stopped, and how tax relief will affect their credit or future refunds. It's also important to ask about the documents needed and the fees involved to ensure the service is worthwhile.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were laid off as part of a reduction in force. Judge Myong Joun stated that the department must be able to carry out its functions and obligations as mandated by Congress. The ruling comes after 21 states and the American Federation of Teachers filed lawsuits against the administration over the staff cuts.
