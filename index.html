            <p>The British government has stepped in to ensure the continued operation of British Steel's blast furnaces by securing crucial raw material supplies. Coking coal and iron ore shipments from the US and Australia are being arranged after talks with the Chinese owner, Jingye, broke down. This intervention aims to prevent the furnaces from shutting down, which would eliminate the UK's capacity to produce virgin steel. The government is actively seeking a private sector partner to ensure the long-term viability of the Scunthorpe plant, while also addressing concerns about Chinese investment in critical infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spent $458 million on overtime in the last fiscal year due to rising vacancy rates and expanding responsibilities.
