The 54-year-old parliamentarian, a prominent figure from the 2014 Euromaidan protests, was killed in Lviv by an assailant disguised as a courier. According to Ukraine's interior minister, the investigation indicates the assassination was meticulously planned, with the attacker having mapped out Parubiy's travel schedule and escape route.

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel laureate often called the “godfather of AI,” shared his insights on the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and the escalating technology race between the United States and China. In a recent interview following his first trip to China, Hinton, who left his position at Google to speak more freely about AI's risks, discussed his concerns about preventing a potential AI takeover. His pioneering work on neural networks was fundamental to the development of today's machine learning technology, lending significant weight to his warnings about the future of AI.</p>

          <p>Former professional footballer Troy Deeney has announced his selections for the Premier League's Team of the Week, highlighting several players for their exceptional performances. Among those praised were Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai for his defensive solidity and a 'magic' free-kick, and Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi for his leadership and a 'wonderful finish'. Deeney also commended players like Bournemouth's David Brooks, who he named the best player on the pitch against Tottenham, and Chelsea's Joao Pedro, whom he considers the signing of the summer so far for his immediate impact.</p>

Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent victory, has been the subject of an improved £35 million bid. Glasner emphasized that a suitable replacement for the crucial defender has not been found and that there is an agreement with the chairman to only sell Guehi if a replacement is secured.

          <p>Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao has premiered her new film, “Hamnet,” an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. In an interview, Zhao described the period after her Marvel film “Eternals” as a “very painful fire,” which led to a profound personal change and influenced her more intimate approach to this new project. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has received a rapturous response at the Telluride Film Festival, marking a return to the smaller-scale, character-driven storytelling that defined her earlier acclaimed works like “Nomadland.”</p>

          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's shocking 31-17 upset loss to the unranked Florida State Seminoles, Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel declared that the era of teams fearing Alabama is over. Manziel asserted that the "fear aspect" of facing the historically dominant program is "completely gone" and that no opponent on their schedule will be intimidated anymore. The loss marked a significant stumble for Alabama in the post-Nick Saban era, prompting widespread commentary on the team's perceived decline from its long-held dynasty status in college football.</p>

Ramsey strongly advised against this, stating that the act had hurt, not helped, her daughter by putting her in a vehicle she couldn't afford.

The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president in this area. This push is part of Trump's ongoing efforts based on his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election.

          <p>A significant heat wave is affecting Southern California over the Labor Day weekend, with temperatures expected to reach up to 107 degrees in some valley areas. Alongside the heat advisories, the National Weather Service has issued a beach hazards statement for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, warning of dangerous rip currents and elevated surf up to six feet. Forecasters are advising beachgoers to swim near lifeguard towers or avoid the water entirely. Additionally, a slight chance of thunderstorms later in the weekend brings an increased risk of lightning-sparked wildfires.</p>

          <p>After a 2-1 loss to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season in two decades, raising questions about their ability to challenge for the title. Despite significant spending and the return of key midfielder Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency reminiscent of last season's trophyless campaign. Historically, no team in a 38-game season has recovered from such a poor start to win the league. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team's struggles after conceding the lead, stating they "forgot to play."</p>

The host of "Hell's Kitchen" shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks on social media, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and is rarely life-threatening, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early.

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes the current state of the Russia-Ukraine war, arguing that President Trump's contradictory and improvisational approach has created a confusing stalemate. While Trump positions himself as a mediator, his vacillating policies have undermined U.S. credibility, allowing Vladimir Putin to benefit from the prolonged uncertainty and international fatigue. The article suggests that Putin's strategy is to grind down his adversaries through obfuscation while the West tires of the conflict. It concludes that unless Trump adopts a clear, coercive strategy, he risks enabling a Russian victory and diminishing U.S. global standing.</p>

Simultaneously, data shows that accumulation across all wallet sizes, from small holders to whales, has reached its highest level since April, indicating broad-based buying pressure across the market.
