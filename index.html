          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese exports, which includes a reduction for automobiles from the previous 25%. President Trump stated the deal involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The announcement spurred a major rally in Japanese markets, with stocks for automakers like Toyota and Honda surging in response to the more favorable tariff terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has invalidated a New Jersey law that prohibited the federal government from using privately operated immigration detention facilities. The 2-1 decision allows private prison firm CoreCivic to continue operating the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility, a key site for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The court ruled that the state law improperly interfered with the federal government's authority to enforce immigration laws, a decision praised by the Trump administration but criticized by New Jersey's Attorney General.</p>

          <p>The family of Brian Holmes, who died at Castle Hill Hospital after a heart valve procedure, claims the hospital covered up medical errors by issuing two different death certificates. An unpublished review seen by the BBC revealed the procedure involved "very poor care" and that the hospital failed to disclose that the valve was misplaced, leading to emergency surgery. The hospital, which is under police investigation for multiple deaths related to the same procedure, stated that amending death certificates is not uncommon.</p>

          <p>A professional violinist from Worcestershire has spoken out after being sent unsolicited pornographic images by a fellow musician, stating she felt ignored by West Mercia Police. Anna Downes reported the cyberflashing incident in September, but it took nearly six months and media involvement before the perpetrator was arrested and convicted. The case highlights the challenges victims face and questions the police's prioritization of such crimes, even after cyberflashing was made illegal in the UK.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has directed all national sports governing bodies to align their policies with President Trump's executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women's sports. In a letter, the USOPC stated its obligation as a federally chartered organization to comply with the federal mandate, which threatens to rescind funding from non-compliant groups. This marks a significant policy shift and has been condemned by advocacy groups like the National Women's Law Center as a submission to political pressure.</p>

          <p>England's women's football team has reached its third consecutive major final after a tumultuous and dramatic journey at Euro 2025.

Their semi-final victory over Italy was sealed with a last-minute winner in extra time, capping a run defined by resilience, late goals, and what their manager described as being "like a movie."</p>

It connects the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for a merger, with the House GOP's decision to recess early to avoid a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein's files. The author argues these actions demonstrate a pattern of powerful entities bending to pressure from the White House to avoid political or financial repercussions.</p>

          <p>At 45 years old, pitcher Rich Hill is set to continue his remarkable baseball career by joining the Kansas City Royals, his 14th different Major League Baseball team. This move will tie the record for the most teams played for by a single player. Hill, who has pitched in the league for 20 seasons, including a notable stint with the Los Angeles Dodgers, will be the oldest pitcher to start an MLB game since 2012. His debut for the Royals will fittingly be against the Chicago Cubs, the team he first played for in 2005.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the Trump administration is actively purging women from senior leadership positions in the U.S. military. The author points to the recent removal of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids as head of the U.S. Naval Academy, which follows the firings of several other high-ranking female officers, leaving no women in four-star roles. The article contends this pattern reflects Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's stated views against what he calls "social engineering," sending a message that women are not welcome in the military's top echelons.</p>

          <p>Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile is now home to 72 tourist-focused gift shops, prompting concerns from residents that "overtourism" is eroding the area's local character. Long-time residents note the disappearance of essential businesses like grocers and butchers, replaced by a monoculture of souvenir retail that caters exclusively to the city's five million annual visitors. While the tourism industry supports tens of thousands of jobs, locals argue the imbalance negatively affects community life and makes the area feel less like a place to live.</p>
