        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose 2.7% annually and 0.2% monthly in July, slightly below economists' forecasts, while core inflation, which excludes food and energy, hit a five-month high of 3.1% annually. The report suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had a modest impact on consumer prices so far, with lower energy costs helping to offset increases in other categories like household furnishings. Following the data's release, market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September increased, as officials weigh rising inflation against signs of a weakening labor market.

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and gross margin forecasts despite facing new tariffs. The popular sneaker brand now anticipates annual sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, signaling strong consumer demand that has so far been unaffected by recent price hikes. The company's net loss was attributed to foreign exchange fluctuations, but its performance outpaced Wall Street expectations across all major regions, including 50% growth in China. This continued success highlights On's growing market share against legacy brands like Nike. (not investment advice)</p>

She expresses regret over the handling of transgender rights legislation, which she admits caused significant division and led to her feeling like she "lost the dressing room." Sturgeon also reflects on the immense mental and physical toll of leading Scotland through the COVID-19 pandemic, her strained relationship with predecessor Alex Salmond, and the pain of a miscarriage. The book provides a frank look at the pressures she faced, including sexism and the police investigation into SNP finances.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly intensified his pressure on the Federal Reserve by threatening to permit a "major lawsuit" against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The threat is reportedly linked to the costs associated with renovating the Federal Reserve's headquarters building in Washington. This move represents a dramatic escalation in the president's ongoing public campaign to influence the central bank's decisions. Trump has been openly demanding that Powell and the Federal Reserve implement immediate interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated and dangerous online scam, dubbed "CAPTCHAgeddon," is using fake "Are you human?" security checks to trick users into installing malware. The method, known as ClickFix, presents a legitimate-looking CAPTCHA screen, but clicking the verify button secretly copies a malicious script to the user's clipboard. Victims are then prompted to paste and run this command, which can steal passwords, files, and other sensitive data without downloading a traditional file. Security researchers warn this tactic is more convincing and stealthy than previous methods and is spreading across compromised websites, social media, and phishing emails.</p>

However, critics point out that the administration has simultaneously weakened broader environmental regulations that protect numerous other species, including protections for migratory birds and endangered species, often to benefit the oil and gas industry. They argue that climate change and domestic cats are far greater threats to bird populations than wind turbines.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to one-time, non-cash IPO-related charges, the company's shares surged over 7%. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the growth to rising interest from major financial institutions, spurred by more supportive crypto legislation under the Trump administration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage experts suggest that a significant drop in 30-year fixed mortgage rates to below 6% is unlikely to occur before mid-to-late 2026 unless there is a major economic downturn or geopolitical crisis. Currently hovering around 6.75%, rates are influenced by factors like low unemployment and persistent inflation, which keep borrowing costs elevated. For rates to fall into the 5% range, experts say there would need to be a sustained period of lower bond yields or a significant negative shift in economic indicators. Despite higher rates, advantages to buying now include potentially lower home prices and the ability to refinance later. (not investment advice)</p>

Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman stated the mission was to protect federal facilities and personnel, but noted he withheld support for one operation after a DHS official questioned his loyalty.

One option is to reinvest the money in a taxable brokerage account, preferably using tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For those who are charitably inclined, a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) allows a direct, tax-free transfer from an IRA to a nonprofit, satisfying the RMD requirement. Another strategy is using the funds for legacy planning by contributing to a 529 college savings plan for grandchildren, which may also offer a state tax deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

The defense has argued that the accuser's testimony is unreliable and motivated by long-held resentment from their brief relationship over a decade ago. Rossi faces a separate sexual assault charge in another Utah county.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder for her role in a 2019 murder-for-hire plot in Birmingham, UK. Prosecutors said Betro was hired by two men to settle a family feud and attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but the handgun jammed. Disguised in a niqab, she later returned to fire three shots at the family's home before fleeing to the U.S. Betro, who met one of her co-conspirators on a dating app, was eventually captured in Armenia and extradited. She denied involvement, claiming it was a case of mistaken identity.</p>

          <p>The European team for the 2025 Ryder Cup is shaping up to be nearly identical to the victorious 2023 squad, signaling strong continuity for Captain Luke Donald. Key players like Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Tommy Fleetwood have already secured their spots, with others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expected to follow. This settled roster contrasts sharply with the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. team and provides Europe with a stable foundation as it aims for a rare victory on American soil at Bethpage. The only potential change from the Rome team could see Rasmus Højgaard replace his twin brother, Nicolai.</p>

          <p>An attorney is raising alarms about a potential outbreak of a respiratory illness, possibly COVID-19, at a remote Florida immigration detention facility known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The lawyer, Eric Lee, reports that his client was removed from the camp after falling ill and that conditions have worsened, with a vast majority of detainees now showing symptoms. Detainees' requests for masks have allegedly been denied, and they have limited access to showers, creating what Lee calls a "petri dish for disease." The claims follow a report from a former corrections officer who said she contracted COVID-19 after working at the unsanitary facility.</p>

The job cuts, which reportedly could affect over 300 positions, are taking place at the company's research, development, and testing facilities on the mainland. This move reflects Micron's efforts to navigate fluctuations in the global memory chip industry while also dealing with the complexities of heightened U.S.-China trade tensions.

Pakistan's government, which has been fighting an insurgency by Baloch separatists for years, welcomed the designation.

He has been highly active on the international stage, meeting with world leaders and taking a firm stance on global issues, but has faced domestic criticism for tightening border controls and for a crisis over judicial appointments that has strained his coalition.</p>
