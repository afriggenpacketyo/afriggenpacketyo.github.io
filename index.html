          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a robust second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and demonstrating a strong recovery from the previous year's loss. While facing challenges such as a strong euro and mixed investment banking results, the bank's revenues aligned with forecasts, and its Chief Financial Officer expressed confidence in meeting full-year targets. This financial rebound led to a nearly 6% surge in Deutsche Bank shares, nearing a decade-high. The article provides context on the broader European banking environment, which is navigating a lower interest rate landscape, and notes domestic political stability in Germany as a contributing factor to improved investor sentiment.

          <p>President Donald Trump launched his "American AI Action Plan" by signing three executive orders, notably vowing to prevent "woke AI" in federal government applications. One order specifically mandates that federal AI models remain neutral and nonpartisan, prioritizing truth and accuracy over ideological agendas like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), which the administration views as destructive. This initiative aims to establish the U.S. as an AI export leader while addressing concerns about AI output manipulation and previous controversies involving AI models like xAI's Grok. The article highlights that this policy aligns with the administration's broader anti-DEI stance, aiming for "truth-seeking" AI.</p>

          <p>A Russian An-24 passenger plane, carrying 43 passengers and six crew members, including five children, tragically disappeared from radar during a flight in the far eastern Amur region. The aircraft's burning fuselage was subsequently located about nine miles from its intended destination, the town of Tynda, on a mountainside. Regional Governor Vasily Orlov confirmed the incident and the immediate deployment of over 50 personnel and 10 pieces of equipment for search and rescue operations. The discovery of the wreckage, with no evidence of survivors from above, indicates a catastrophic event, prompting a somber response from authorities.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's transfer to Barcelona from Manchester United has generated significant interest among Catalan fans and media, eager to assess his impact on the team. Barcelona-based journalists note that while Rashford was not the club's initial top target, his versatility as a winger or false nine is highly valued for providing squad depth and resting key players like Robert Lewandowski. Despite his recent inconsistent form, there is considerable optimism that he can revitalize his career at Camp Nou, with many viewing the move as mutually beneficial. The article also highlights his unique position as the first Englishman to represent Barcelona since Gary Lineker in 1989.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a significant free trade deal with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, designed to reduce tariffs and enhance market access for both nations. The agreement, which concluded negotiations in May after nearly three years of talks, is anticipated to boost bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion annually by 2040 and contribute £4.8 billion a year to the British economy. India will decrease tariffs on British goods, including spirits and vehicles, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. This landmark pact is seen as a major win for both economies, fostering trade, investment, growth, and job creation.</p>

          <p>The White House is pushing back against reports that President Donald Trump was informed of his name appearing in Justice Department documents related to convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the claims as "fake news." Although Trump was previously acquainted with Epstein, appearing in these documents does not indicate any wrongdoing, and Trump has never faced accusations in connection with the case. The administration has been under pressure to disclose more information, with the Justice Department clarifying that no "incriminating client list" was found. This article details the ongoing political and legal complexities surrounding the Epstein case, including a judge's denial to unseal related files and a House subcommittee's vote to subpoena the Justice Department for documents.</p>

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) characterized these figures as "depressing," expressing hope that this period represents the nadir for the UK auto industry.

          <p>At the 25th EU-China summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for strengthened communication and cooperation, emphasizing the mutual benefits of their relationship amidst complex global geopolitics. Conversely, European leaders Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen pressed China to address the significant and growing trade imbalance, asserting that rebalancing relations is essential and urging "real solutions." Von der Leyen specifically highlighted concerns over Beijing's export of excess industrial supply, which has strained relations, leading to EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and subsequent Chinese anti-dumping probes.

          <p>Tesla announced it has begun "first builds of a more affordable model" in June and anticipates securing European approval for its self-driving software this year. These initiatives come as the electric car manufacturer grapples with significant challenges, including a 12% sales decline—its sharpest in a decade—and a 16% reduction in profit. The company's struggles are attributed to decreased U.S. government support for electric vehicles, escalating competition from Chinese carmakers, and the perceived negative influence of Elon Musk's controversial political engagements. Additionally, U.S. tariff policies imposed a $300 million cost on Tesla during the last quarter, further impacting its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

A self-taught artist, Madu draws parallels with Van Gogh's unique style and their shared influence from East Asian art.

          <p>China's waste-to-energy incineration industry, despite possessing the world's largest processing capacity, is now grappling with a severe oversupply issue, paradoxically stemming from an insufficient supply of waste. Government data indicates that while municipal solid waste generation increased by just over 10% since 2019, incineration capacity more than doubled, leaving an estimated 40% of capacity idle. Experts attribute this imbalance to a slowdown in waste supply growth, influenced by factors such as an economic downturn and decelerating urbanization. This lesser-known problem mirrors broader oversupply challenges seen across various Chinese industries, from traditional manufacturing to high-tech sectors, raising questions about planning and demand.</p>

Nepal, strategically located between China and India, has historically leaned towards India due to cultural ties.

          <p>The United States and China are engaged in a complex technological arms race, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, with significant geopolitical and economic implications. Both nations are investing heavily, with China committing $15 billion to quantum technologies before 2023, compared to the US's $3.8 billion in public funding, signaling a fierce competition for technological supremacy. Dominance in these fields could confer massive economic and cyber-offensive advantages, potentially undermining encryption and disrupting critical infrastructure. The article highlights the unique challenge of this competition given deep trade ties and concerns about talent flow, with US firms like OpenAI increasing vetting of staff to secure sensitive information.</p>

          <p>China is set to implement a rare direct fiscal support measure by offering monthly electronic subsidy coupons to seniors, aiming to alleviate financial strain on its aging population and stimulate consumption in elderly-care services. These allowances, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will cover part of the costs for services like meal assistance and rehabilitation, specifically for "moderately, severely or completely disabled" seniors. The initiative, starting with a pilot program this month before a nationwide rollout, seeks to foster new growth drivers and strengthen the social safety net. This policy addresses mounting demographic pressures and calls for enhanced social welfare amidst a rapidly graying society. (not investment advice)</p>

Deoleo, for whom the U.S. is a strategically critical market, emphasizes that access to olive oil should be promoted, not penalized, for consumer health. The article notes that a reduction in U.S. imports could create a supply glut in the EU, intensifying competition among producers and affecting other European goods like whiskey and wine.

This marks the first appeals court ruling on the issue, pushing the matter closer to a potential Supreme Court review. The ruling reinforces the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, stating that all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens, and prevents the order's nationwide enforcement.</p>
