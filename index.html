          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed Elon Musk's recent criticisms, stating he was "not particularly" interested in speaking with him after a public exchange of words. Trump downplayed the feud, referring to Musk as someone who has "lost his mind." The conflict arose from Musk's disapproval of Trump's tax and immigration bill, leading to mutual attacks and threats. Despite the heated exchange, Trump appeared more saddened than angered by the situation, with aides reporting he seemed "bummed" about the breakup of their alliance. The incident underscores the complex dynamics between political figures and business leaders. </p>

          <p>Suzuki Motor Corp. has temporarily stopped production of its Swift compact hatchback due to China's export restrictions on rare-earth elements. The restrictions have caused delays in procuring essential parts that rely on these materials. China's export controls, implemented in April as retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have begun disrupting production in the U.S. and Europe. Suzuki suspended production at its Sagara plant on May 26 and plans to partially resume on June 13, with full resumption expected on June 16. The incident underscores the vulnerability of global supply chains to geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump called for a full percentage point interest rate cut from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite a strong jobs report. Trump argued that the rate cut would lower long- and short-term debt costs for the U.S. He suggested that Powell could raise rates again if inflation were to increase as a result of the cut. Trump continued his criticism of Powell, stating that the Fed's actions were costing the country a fortune and that borrowing costs should be much lower. The president's remarks highlight his ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic growth. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food firms are increasingly trying to reduce the number of ingredients in their products, driven by growing consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers and brands are responding to demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists, with some seeing a significant increase in inquiries about low-ingredient products. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on reducing ingredients can lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients, potentially impacting public health. The trend reflects a broader debate about the definition and health implications of processed foods, with experts emphasizing the importance of nutrition over the degree of processing. The industry is adapting to evolving consumer preferences. </p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices declined slightly in May from their April peak, driven by consumer fears of tariff-related price increases, but remain elevated compared to last year. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index decreased 1.5% from April to May, but is still 4% higher than a year ago. Demand remains strong due to low inventory levels caused by consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles don't directly impact used car sales, they influence the used car market by affecting new vehicle prices, production, and demand. The article indicates a slight easing of pressure on consumers in the used car market. </p>

Five tenant leaders said they have not endorsed Cuomo, while two others said they never approved their names being on the list. The Cuomo campaign responded by suggesting that some leaders felt intimidated by supporters of other candidates. Securing endorsements from NYCHA tenant leaders is crucial due to the large number of New Yorkers residing in NYCHA developments.

          <p>The article argues that President Trump's travel ban disproportionately affects countries in the global south with a history of U.S. imperialism, military intervention, and economic coercion.

The author contends that the poverty and insecurity in these nations are a result of historical and ongoing exploitation by wealthier nations. The article criticizes the ban as a cruel escalation of policies that profit off vulnerable populations.
