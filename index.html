          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:05:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for the struggling department store Kohl's soared by nearly 38% in a single day, fueled by renewed interest from retail investors in so-called meme stocks. This phenomenon, popularized by online communities like Reddit's WallStreetBets, sees investors rally behind heavily shorted companies despite poor financial performance, such as Kohl's recent first-quarter loss. The surge reflects a broader market trend where sentiment and social media buzz can create extreme volatility. Some analysts warn that such froth could be a red flag for market stability, viewing it as a tactical battle between individual investors and short sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant conflict unfolded in New Jersey as federal judges utilized a rare power to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump. The judges appointed her top assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the position instead. However, in a swift response, the Trump administration's Justice Department fired Grace, with the Attorney General accusing the judges of being "rogue" and threatening presidential powers. This power struggle highlights deep partisan tensions, with Democrats praising the judges' initial move and the administration defending Habba's appointment as the president's choice.</p>

          <h2>China's 'Starlink' Competitor, the Qianfan Network, Faces Potential Delays</h2>

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite network, intended to rival SpaceX's Starlink, is reportedly encountering significant hurdles that may delay its deployment. The project, led by Shanghai Yuanxin Satellite Technology, aims to launch over 15,000 satellites by 2030 but is constrained by a severe shortage of available rockets. To meet its initial deployment milestones for regional and global coverage, the company would need to launch more than 30 satellites per month. This bottleneck highlights the strain on China's current manufacturing and launch capacity as it struggles to keep up with the surging demand for satellite deployment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has updated its policy to bar transgender women from competing in the women's categories for Team USA. This decision aligns with a recent executive order from President Trump titled "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports." In a memo, the USOPC stated its obligation as a federally chartered organization is to comply with federal mandates to ensure fair and safe competition environments. Following the USOPC's change, other sports bodies like USA Fencing have already updated their own guidelines, mandating that transgender women and nonbinary athletes compete in men's events.</p>

Sciver-Brunt, England's all-time leading wicket-taker, observed that fielding errors have become a regular issue, speculating that some players may be scared to fail. She clarified her critique is not about a lack of desire but a mental barrier, calling for the team to be stronger and more outwardly expressive in their fight.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering the elimination of the federal capital gains tax on profits from home sales, a move that could significantly alter the housing market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in gains, a figure unchanged since 1997. Proponents, including the National Association of Realtors, argue that the current tax structure creates a "stay-put penalty," discouraging older homeowners from selling and thus constraining housing inventory. Critics, however, contend that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home values. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation concluded that the small aircraft was overweight at takeoff and experienced significant drag from a set of moose antlers affixed to an external wing strut. These factors, combined with downdrafts and turbulent conditions, likely resulted in the plane having insufficient power to clear the terrain. The report notes that while carrying antlers externally is common in Alaska, it requires formal FAA approval, which this aircraft lacked.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation signed by President Trump has created a new student loan repayment option called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven plan will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with monthly bills ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings, and a minimum payment of $10. As the law also phases out several existing repayment options, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years and includes some benefits, such as a subsidy for those not making progress on their principal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's posting habits on social media have become increasingly erratic and desperate, particularly amid scrutiny over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Over a recent weekend, Trump posted dozens of times, sharing AI-generated images of political rivals in prison and inscrutable viral videos. This behavior is interpreted by some observers as a sign of a president on the defensive, lashing out and retreating into a fantasy world where he is a universally beloved hero with unilateral power. The pattern points to a leader who may be feeling powerless and increasingly detached from reality.</p>
