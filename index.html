          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 12:07:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is proposing that Iran accept restrictions on its nuclear program to avert a possible Israeli military strike, potentially with U.S. support, as confirmed by U.S. and Israeli officials. Discussions are ongoing, with Steve Witkoff planning further talks with Iran in Oman. The International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran is not complying with nuclear non-proliferation obligations, leading to swift condemnation from Iran and further orders for a new enrichment facility. The U.S. proposal involves Iran procuring enriched nuclear fuel from outside the country to maintain a limited civilian program, while Russia could potentially participate by supplying nuclear fuel or storing Iran's enriched uranium. Optimism surrounding diplomatic resolutions remains uncertain given the increasing tensions and possibility of military action.</p>

          <p>The Harvey Weinstein retrial in New York concluded with a mistrial declared on the charge of third-degree sexual assault against Jessica Mann, after the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict. Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley and not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola. Mann testified that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2013, during what she described as a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. The defense emphasized that Mann continued to see Weinstein after the alleged assault, but Mann stated that sexual assault can occur in relationships where power and manipulation are present. Weinstein could face another retrial in New York on the sexual assault charge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and urging him to lower interest rates. Trump claimed that lowering rates by two percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, but Powell is not taking action. This is the third time in two days that a member of the Trump administration has targeted the central bank leader, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance also calling for interest rate cuts. Markets were mostly unmoved by Trump's remarks, and traders have priced in virtually no chance that the Fed will cut rates following its meeting next week. (not investment advice)</p>

Haley said the verdict gives her hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the perfect victim is fading.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation, with recent data on consumer and producer prices remaining benign. Several factors are keeping inflation in check, including companies hoarding imported goods ahead of tariff announcements, the time it takes for charges to affect the economy, and a lack of pricing power due to consumer tightening. Economists believe the limited impact in May reflects pre-tariff stockpiling and a lagged pass-through of tariffs into import prices. It is expected that the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA and Axiom Space have indefinitely delayed the launch of a commercial flight to the International Space Station due to concerns about a persistent air leak in a Russian compartment. The leak, located in the Zvezda module's PrK vestibule, has prompted cosmonauts to inspect and seal areas of interest. The delay will allow NASA and Roscosmos additional time to evaluate the situation and determine if further troubleshooting is necessary. The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and the leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day. The Russians and Americans have differing opinions on the cause of the leak and the safety of continued operations.</p>

          <p>During chaotic times, it is common to seek safety, but Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed experimentation and risk-taking as a response to trouble. Instead of flying to safety in old routines, people should experiment with their happiness. Academic literature offers examples of behavioral interventions, such as gratitude, social interaction, mindfulness, exercise, and exposure to nature. By reconceiving life as an experimental practice, individuals can yield new ideas and habits, especially when times are rough and they need to get out of a rut, ultimately boosting their well-being.</p>

          <p>There has been an unexpected surge in people claiming Social Security benefits, with claims nearly 18% higher between January and May compared to the same period last year. The Social Security Administration identified three key reasons: a peak of retiring Baby Boomers, a rule change increasing benefits for some with pensions, and a bump in people re-filing to claim higher benefits based on their own records. Worries about the economic future under the Trump administration are also a factor, with some fearing the government will raise the minimum retirement age. Despite President Trump's assurances, some individuals are choosing to claim benefits early, fearing they may be taken away.</p>

The cuts are part of a Republican plan to eliminate $9 billion in funding for programs approved before Trump's second term, including $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. Advocates argue the cuts are destructive and harmful to communities with limited local news sources, while Republicans claim they are eliminating taxpayer funding for biased media outlets. The cuts could lead to staffing reductions, programming reductions, and news cutbacks, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <p>A Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane bound for London with 242 people aboard crashed into a residential area shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad in western India. Ahmedabad police commissioner G.S. Malik told The Associated Press that it appeared "there are no survivors in the plane crash," though there were unconfirmed local media reports that one man on board survived. The signal from Air India Flight 171 was lost less than a minute after takeoff, according to flight tracking site FlightRadar24. The cause of the crash and why the plane lost altitude so quickly were not immediately known.</p>

          <p>Six of eight activists detained by Israel after their boat was intercepted en route to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza have been deported. Among those deported was French-Palestinian European parliament member Rima Hassan. The Israeli foreign ministry confirmed the deportations, while Israeli human rights group Adalah said two others remain in Israeli custody awaiting deportation. Adalah reported that the activists were subjected to mistreatment, punitive measures, and aggressive treatment while in custody, with two held in solitary confinement for a period. The Israeli foreign ministry previously stated that those who refused to sign deportation documents would face judicial proceedings to have them deported, in accordance with Israeli law.</p>

          <p>The Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, and New York are defending their states' immigration policies in a Republican-led House Oversight Committee, amidst ongoing protests in Los Angeles. The governors are addressing questions about their policies as so-called "sanctuary states," and criticizing Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with Hochul saying it "undermines sovereignty." Republicans have slammed the governors, citing examples where illegal immigrants committed crimes in their states, while the governors maintain that immigration is managed by the federal government. The hearing follows a similar one in March with "sanctuary city" mayors.</p>

          <p>Republicans are using images of Ice protesters waving Mexican flags in Los Angeles to incite fear, but the author argues that the Mexican flag represents more than just nationalism. It symbolizes the Chicano movement, cultural unity, and the shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants. The flag represents the in-between state of cultures and identities, and the power of transforming prejudice into strength. Amidst the protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation of shared struggles and a call for solidarity, despite the Trump administration's efforts to intimidate protesters and deploy military force.</p>

          <p>A survey of retail executives indicates that most expect President Trump to walk back the proposed "reciprocal" tariffs on goods from the European Union, Vietnam, India, and Mexico after a 90-day pause. The survey, conducted by AlixPartners, found that executives believe Trump will maintain the current 10% duty rather than implement higher rates. The anticipation stems from recent trade negotiations with China and a court ruling challenging Trump's authority to impose the tariffs. However, some caution that the optimism may be premature and that these other countries do not have the same leverage that China has to negotiate the terms of the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
