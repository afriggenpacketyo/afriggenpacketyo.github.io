          <p>David Kaczynski, who identified his brother Ted as the Unabomber, has formed a close friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of Ted's bombs in 1987. After turning his brother in, David felt immense guilt and began reaching out to victims' families to apologize. This led to a connection with Wright, and over the years, the two have shared their story publicly, demonstrating how compassion can emerge from profound violence and tragedy. Their bond serves as a powerful example of reconciliation and healing, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dark chapter of American history.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the growing problem of AI-powered "nudify" services that allow users to easily create nonconsensual explicit images of people from their social media photos. The article focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a male friend had created such deepfakes of them, causing significant emotional trauma. Because the images were not distributed, no laws were broken, revealing a legal gray area that lawmakers are now trying to address. The incident underscores the real-world harm caused by accessible AI tools and the challenges in regulating them as the technology rapidly advances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets prevent people from increasing their income, rather than a lack of intelligence or desire. The first limiting belief is the shame of admitting you don't know how to earn more, which stops people from seeking necessary help or education. Another is the false expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the need for patience and consistent effort. Finally, the habit of procrastinating by telling oneself they will start "later" allows dreams to fade without any action ever being taken.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns before the next general election as a cornerstone of its economic growth strategy. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, which aims to deliver 1.5 million new homes by 2029, drawing inspiration from the post-war government's housing initiatives. While the party is enthusiastic, the construction industry has warned of significant challenges, including rising costs and taxes that could impede the ambitious target. Additionally, some residents in the earmarked areas have expressed concern over a lack of communication about the scale of the proposed developments.</p>

          <p>The master of ceremonies hired to entertain the crowd at the Ryder Cup has resigned after being recorded leading a vulgar chant targeting golfer Rory McIlroy. Comedian Heather McMahan encouraged the crowd in a "Fuck you Rory!" chant, contributing to what was described as a toxic and ugly atmosphere at the Bethpage event. The abuse toward McIlroy became so intense during his round that state police were brought in to escort his group, and several spectators were ejected.

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the bottoms of one's feet before bed can improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but health experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists and sleep psychologists point to a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin to induce sleep. They note that the skin on the soles of the feet is particularly thick, making absorption unlikely. Experts suggest any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing effect of a nightly foot massage routine rather than the magnesium itself.</p>

          <p>A contentious battle is unfolding in Northern California over a proposal to redraw the state's voting map, a move that could oust seven-term Republican representative and Trump ally, Doug LaMalfa. The plan, now before voters as Proposition 50, aims to create five new Democratic seats in response to gerrymandering in Texas and could significantly shift the balance of power in the House. Supporters argue it's a necessary check on the Trump administration's agenda, while opponents decry it as a partisan power grab that unfairly disadvantages rural, conservative voters. The fight has mobilized both parties for a high-stakes special election in November.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes and providing price floors for U.S. mining companies to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China. Following a deal to support rare earth miner MP Materials, other companies like Energy Fuels and Lithium Americas have seen their stocks surge on speculation of further government investment. Industry leaders argue that multiple deals are necessary to diversify supply and counter China's market manipulation. This strategy marks a significant shift towards a state-supported industrial policy for minerals essential to defense and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is preparing for its eight-day "golden week" holiday, with officials forecasting that 2.4 billion journeys will be made across the country. This major travel period is expected to provide a significant boost to China's consumer economy, which has been seeking momentum. The Ministry of Transport predicts that nearly 80% of these trips will be made by car, with Wednesday, the first day of the holiday, expected to be the busiest travel day. The anticipated surge in tourism and spending is seen as a crucial opportunity for economic stimulus.</p>

          <p>The UK government is backing a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its supply chain recover from a debilitating cyberattack that has halted production for nearly a month. The shutdown has raised concerns that some of JLR's suppliers could face collapse. A local MP and chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee suggested that further government assistance might be necessary to support the extensive network of businesses that rely on JLR. The incident has been described as a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic suggests that jury nullification—the right of a jury to acquit a defendant they believe is guilty under an unjust law—may be a necessary tool for ordinary citizens to resist the Trump administration's use of the Justice Department for political ends. Citing the recent indictment of former FBI director James Comey, the author argues that as politically motivated prosecutions increase, jurors can and should refuse to convict. The essay frames nullification as a legitimate, albeit controversial, historical weapon against tyranny that can protect the rule of law when it is being perverted by those in power.</p>

The National Hurricane Center is urging residents of Bermuda to closely monitor the storm's progress. Swells generated by Humberto are also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast starting Monday, making it a dangerous system even from a distance.</p>

          <p>A Texas community is grappling with the tragic case of Benjamin Elliott, a teenager who fatally stabbed his twin sister, Meghan, in her sleep and then called 911, claiming he thought he was dreaming. With no apparent motive or history of conflict between the deeply close siblings, the defense argues that Benjamin, who has a family history of parasomnia, was sleepwalking during the act. A sleep disorder expert who studied Benjamin supports this claim, but prosecutors remain unconvinced and have charged him with murder. The case explores the rare and complex legal defense of sleepwalking in a violent crime.</p>

          <p>President Trump has voiced strong support for Argentine President Javier Milei's radical economic reforms, which have been compared to Margaret Thatcher's policies in the 1980s. Milei's "shock therapy" approach includes deep cuts to public spending, mass layoffs of public sector workers, and an attack on trade union rights, all aimed at curbing hyperinflation. While these measures have won praise from the IMF and financial markets, critics highlight their severe human cost, including rising unemployment, falling real wages, and a widening gender pay gap. The U.S. has signaled its readiness to provide financial support to prop up its ideological ally.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian contends that the Trump administration has triggered a crisis of legitimacy by systematically undermining the constitutional order and the social contract between the government and its citizens. The author argues that by defying court orders, attacking the judiciary, and revoking legal statuses, the administration has abandoned the principle that the government must also follow the rules. The Supreme Court is also criticized for enabling this trend by gutting judicial checks on executive power. The article suggests that this erosion of the rule of law requires peaceful but firm opposition from the public to restore accountability.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas remarked that he does not consider past court decisions to be "gospel" and feels no obligation to follow a precedent if he finds it illogical or baseless.

His comments come as the court prepares to hear cases on contentious issues, including a potential challenge to the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage.

According to a report on state broadcaster CCTV, the J-35's radar cross-section is smaller than a human palm, a result of its unique airframe shape and proprietary metamaterial technology. This assertion suggests a significant advancement in China's military aviation capabilities. For comparison, the F-35's radar cross-section is often described as being about the size of a golf ball, indicating a potential new level of stealth for the Chinese aircraft.</p>

          <p>Food pantries in Maine are struggling to meet rising demand amid a difficult combination of challenges, including federal funding cuts and a critical shortage of volunteers. The state has long faced high rates of food insecurity, and the task is becoming harder as pantries rely heavily on an aging volunteer workforce. Organizations like Neighbor's Cupboard in Winterport depend on retirees to source and distribute food, but finding younger volunteers with the time and physical ability to help is a constant struggle. The situation highlights the fragility of the charitable food network as it becomes an increasingly essential part of the food system.</p>
