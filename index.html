          <p>The abbot of the world-renowned Shaolin Temple in China, Shi Yongxin, is under a multi-departmental criminal investigation for a range of serious offenses. A statement from the Buddhist sanctuary accused him of embezzling temple funds and assets, as well as violating religious precepts. Furthermore, the temple alleges that Shi maintained improper long-term relationships with multiple women and fathered illegitimate children. Authorities have promised to release more information about the high-profile case to the public as the investigation progresses.</p>

          <p>In Bogotá, Colombia, a prevalent scam involves perpetrators known as "pinchallantas" who ride motorcycles and deliberately spread sharp objects to puncture car tires. These saboteurs then direct the stranded drivers to nearby mechanics who are complicit in the scheme. The mechanics often exacerbate the damage, claiming more holes exist than there actually are, and then overcharge for the repairs. Despite a police crackdown, the fast-moving nature of the scam makes it difficult to stop, with officials now targeting the suspected repair shops.</p>

Authorities have taken a 42-year-old male suspect into custody, describing the attack as a seemingly random act carried out with a folding knife. The local sheriff praised the response of citizens in the store who assisted in apprehending the suspect and providing aid to the victims.

          <p>Severe wildfires in Turkey are now threatening Bursa, the nation's fourth-largest city, leading to the evacuation of over 1,700 people. The blazes, which have scorched more than 7,000 acres, have resulted in the death of a firefighter who suffered a heart attack on duty. Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli stated that crews were battling 84 separate fires, exacerbated by record-high temperatures reaching 122.9°F (50.5°C). The Turkish government has deployed military personnel to assist firefighters as the fires also pose a threat to neighboring Greece and Bulgaria.</p>

          <p>Following four days of deadly border fighting, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to participate in peace talks hosted in Malaysia. The diplomatic effort was spurred by a call from U.S. President Donald Trump to the leaders of both nations, urging an immediate ceasefire. The conflict has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced thousands of people. While Cambodia readily accepted the ceasefire proposal, Thailand has maintained that a dialogue must precede any formal cessation of hostilities, though it agreed in principle to the talks.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using billboards near struggling rural hospitals to blame President Trump's policies for undermining healthcare access. The campaign highlights the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, a vital funding source for these facilities. An analysis by the Urban Institute projects that rural hospitals could lose $87 billion over the next decade due to the cuts. Democrats argue that a related $50 billion rural health fund is insufficient and functions as a political tool for the administration.</p>

          <p>Oakland's Chinatown, one of the oldest in the U.S., is facing a new economic challenge from trade tariffs after enduring the pandemic and anti-Asian violence. Local merchants report that while customer traffic remains steady, consumer spending has noticeably declined. Business owners, such as a 29-year supermarket veteran, state that the cost of goods imported from China has risen by an average of 50 percent. This has forced shoppers to cut back on purchases of traditional items like ginseng, dried mushrooms, and imported foods, straining the local economy.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic posits that the perceived cronyism and anti-market rhetoric of the Trump administration have fueled a resurgence of socialist ideas in the United States. The author contrasts the historical failures of centrally planned economies, like the Soviet Union's unwearable shoes, with the modern appeal of socialism to a generation feeling let down by the current economic system. The piece argues that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the system's flaws and corruption, rather than simply pointing out the unworkability of socialist alternatives.</p>

          <p>The practice of tipping in the U.S. has its origins in the post-Civil War era, where it was used as a way for employers, particularly in the restaurant and service industries, to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system was later codified with the creation of a lower "tipped minimum wage," currently $2.13 per hour at the federal level, with the expectation that customer tips make up the difference. This article explains how powerful lobbying from groups like the National Restaurant Association has preserved this system, effectively shifting the responsibility of paying wages from employers to consumers.</p>

          <p>A community organizer in Augusta, Georgia, has spent six years trying to open a freestanding birth center to provide an alternative to hospital births in a region considered a maternity care desert. Despite community support and successfully advocating for a change in state law, the effort has been stalled by a lack of cooperation from local hospitals. Proponents argue these centers offer a safe, home-like option for low-risk pregnancies, which is particularly crucial given the state's high maternal mortality rates. Opponents cite concerns over lost revenue and potential malpractice liability for obstetricians who partner with them.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Links Climate Change to Increased Frequency of Sinkholes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 06:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinkholes, which form when water erodes underlying bedrock, are reportedly becoming more frequent due to climate change. Research indicates that intensified extreme weather events, such as severe droughts followed by heavy rainfall, are key contributors. Droughts lower the water table, weakening subterranean support, and subsequent intense rain adds weight that can trigger a collapse. This phenomenon is notable in Turkey's Konya Plain, a karst terrain where increasing drought and groundwater pumping for agriculture have led to a dramatic rise in sinkhole occurrences in populated areas.</p>

          <p>While playing golf at his resort in Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the prospects of a new trade agreement with the European Union, stating the chances are "50-50." The statement comes just ahead of his meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and before a potential increase in U.S. tariffs on EU goods on August 1st. The EU currently faces significant tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars. Trump is also scheduled to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss the recent UK-US trade deal.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the science behind sunscreens and the safety concerns surrounding them, emphasizing the importance of their use in preventing skin cancer. It explains the two main types: organic (often called chemical) sunscreens that absorb UV rays, and physical sunscreens with mineral filters like zinc oxide. While some studies have detected certain sunscreen chemicals in the bloodstream, experts caution that the dose matters and the risks of UV damage are far greater. The article also warns against ineffective DIY sunscreens and notes that future products may utilize protective compounds found in plants.</p>

The pause will last for 10 hours each day in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, amidst growing international concern over a severe hunger crisis in the territory. This move follows months of aid restrictions and global criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.

          <p>Meteorologists are predicting an uptick in Atlantic hurricane activity in the coming weeks, warning that a dangerous August may be ahead despite a relatively quiet start to the season. While the number of named storms is currently above average, their intensity has been low. Forecasters point to several factors for the expected increase, including warming waters in the Main Development Region and the favorable influence of the Madden-Julian Oscillation. They advise that hurdles for hurricane formation are much lower in August and September, urging preparedness for the peak of the season.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures over the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many of the president's supporters in middle America appear unconcerned. Interviews in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, revealed a prevailing sentiment of loyalty, with voters prioritizing issues like border security and the economy over the Epstein saga. Many expressed skepticism about the controversy, viewing it as a politically motivated attack or a distraction. This suggests that while the issue animates a portion of the base, a significant number of Trump voters remain willing to "trust in Trump."</p>

          <p>This essay argues that the common claim of scientific objectivity is a myth and that science has always been entangled with politics and power structures. The authors use historical examples, like 19th-century race science, and contemporary ones, like studies on animal behavior reflecting capitalist and patriarchal norms, to illustrate this point. They contend that by denying its political nature, science becomes vulnerable to bad-faith attacks and can be used to harm marginalized groups. The authors call for scientists to embrace political analysis as part of their work to build a more honest and resilient field.</p>

          <p>China has discovered a super-large zirconium deposit, a mineral crucial for hypersonic weapons technology, potentially boosting its strategic reserves five-fold. The deposit, found in a terrestrial basin, contains an estimated 2 million tonnes of zirconium dioxide, which is four times China's current total reserve. Zirconium alloys are vital for manufacturing components of hypersonic systems like scramjet combustion chambers and nose cones due to their extreme heat resistance. This discovery could address what was seen as a potential vulnerability for China in the geopolitical race for hypersonic supremacy.</p>

One columnist argues against it, warning that abandoning California's independent redistricting commission would ignore the will of voters and could backfire, citing how Democrats' past rule changes enabled the GOP. The other columnist contends that in the face of a potential threat to democracy, gerrymandering becomes a form of "peaceful resistance" necessary to create a congressional check on authoritarianism, even if it's a flawed tactic.</p>

          <p>President Trump's hardline immigration policies have profoundly transformed life along the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to a plunge in crossings and widespread fear among migrants. The changes include a ban on asylum, mass deportations, and the creation of militarized "national defense" zones. This has prompted some migrants already in the U.S. to "self-deport" to Mexico to avoid being arrested and sent to detention centers or third countries. The policies, combined with tariff threats, have also caused economic uncertainty, leading to factory layoffs in border cities like Ciudad Juárez.</p>
