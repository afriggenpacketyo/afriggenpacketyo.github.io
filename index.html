          <p>Esther Ghey, the mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, has voiced her frustration with the government's current approach to online safety, emphasizing the dangers faced by young people online. Ghey's comments come amid concerns that the Online Safety Bill could be weakened to secure trade deals with the US. She advocates for stricter measures, including restricting social media access for children under 16, to protect young individuals from harmful content and mental health struggles. Ghey has previously met with the prime minister to discuss these issues, urging a tougher stance on online safety for children.</p>

          <p>China is grappling with an increasing obesity crisis, with projections indicating that over 65% of adults may be overweight or obese by 2030. This trend raises concerns about the potential strain on the country's healthcare system due to chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. The government has launched a three-year plan, including diet and exercise recommendations, and is introducing "weight management clinics" in hospitals to address the issue. By 2021, the number of overweight or obese adults in China had surpassed 400 million, a figure expected to rise significantly in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Parts of the Midwest and South are preparing for additional flash flooding after days of severe storms and deadly tornadoes. Heavy rains have caused waterways to swell, prompting flash flood emergencies in multiple states. At least 16 people have died due to tornadoes, with more fatalities from flooding. The extreme weather may lead to shipping and supply chain delays. The National Weather Service is facing staffing challenges due to past job cuts.</p>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders, citing the African nation's failure to accept its nationals expelled from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the US is also blocking new visa issuances to prevent further entry. The decision marks the first such measure targeting all passport holders from a specific country since President Trump's return to the White House. The US grants Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to foreign citizens unable to safely return home due to conflict or disasters.</p>

          <p>The government in England is initiating a consultation for its men's health strategy, addressing the issue of men's premature mortality. Men are more likely to die earlier than women due to factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and high cholesterol. The strategy aims to improve men's access to health services and address societal expectations that discourage men from seeking help. Deprivation also plays a significant role, with men in poorer areas having lower life expectancies.</p>
