          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal grant money from 34 cities and counties over their "sanctuary" policies. The ruling by Judge William Orrick prevents the administration from stripping hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants from municipalities that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist with federal immigration actions, expanding protections to more cities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defence Secretary has ordered that the approximately 2,000 National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. will now be armed as part of the Trump administration's crime crackdown. This decision reverses a previous Pentagon stance that the troops would be unarmed, raising questions about a potential change in their mission, which has so far been limited to non-law enforcement roles. The deployment is highly unpopular with local residents and has been criticized by Mayor Muriel Bowser and Chicago's mayor, who fears a similar deployment in his city.</p>

This acquisition provides long-term stability for the Championship club, ending years of uncertainty for supporters who have seen multiple stadium owners and ground changes since leaving Highfield Road in 2005. The deal, which includes the arena's casino and hotel, is expected to allow for investment in facilities and fan experience, bolstering the club's ambition to return to the Premier League.</p>

The judge ruled Singh is a substantial flight risk and found probable cause for six forcible felony charges, including three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. The crash occurred when Singh allegedly attempted an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, causing his semi-truck to block the northbound lanes, leading to a collision with a minivan.</p>

          <h2>Justice Department Declines to Defend Grant Program for Hispanic-Serving Colleges, Citing Unconstitutionality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 10:08:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has announced it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), arguing it is unconstitutional. The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which claims the program's eligibility requirement—that at least 25% of undergraduates be Hispanic—is discriminatory. Citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the DOJ's move puts about $350 million in annual funding for over 500 colleges at risk, forcing an association of HSI universities to intervene to defend the program in court.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has released transcripts of a prison interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, in which she stated she never witnessed inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton in connection with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex-trafficking, also claimed that a rumored Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "not conceivable." In the 300-page document, she described her relationship with Epstein and asserted her belief that his death in jail was not a suicide, although she dismissed theories of murder.</p>

A recent full-range test in September 2024, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated the PLA Rocket Force's credible second-strike capability by successfully sending a dummy warhead across the Pacific. The article emphasizes that the mobility and reliability of the DF-31AG variant ensure it can reach the U.S. mainland, providing a significant strategic counterstrike force for China.</p>

          <p>Medical technology company Medtronic has appointed two new members, John Groetelaars and Bill Jellison, to its board of directors following discussions with activist investor Elliott Investment Management. In response to long-term stock stagnation and investor frustration over slow growth, the board is also creating a Growth Committee and an Operating Committee to focus on portfolio management and margin expansion. These moves signal a new effort by management to address performance issues and pursue a more focused strategy, including tuck-in acquisitions and operational efficiencies.

          <p>Some businesses across the U.S. are bringing back "recession specials," offering discounted deals that signal growing concerns about a potential economic slowdown. This trend, reminiscent of the 2008 Great Recession, reflects deteriorating consumer sentiment, as confirmed by the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which has fallen due to concerns over trade policy and inflation. Establishments from New York coffee shops to San Francisco burger chains are using the "recession" branding to attract customers, suggesting a broader public anxiety about weakening labor markets and business conditions.

          <p>El Salvador's government has ordered all public schools to enforce stringent new disciplinary rules, including mandatory military-style haircuts for boys, immaculate uniforms, and orderly greetings for teachers. The measures, introduced by the new Education Minister, a high-ranking military officer, are defended by President Nayib Bukele's administration as necessary for restoring order.

          <p>President Trump has renewed his attacks on the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), claiming its exhibits are "OUT OF CONTROL" for focusing on the horrors of slavery. This article argues that Trump's rhetoric, which suggests the museum should present a more positive view of the country, recycles a century-old "Lost Cause" myth that sought to downplay the brutality and significance of slavery. The attacks are seen as part of a broader administration effort to politicize cultural institutions and control historical narratives, similar to past campaigns to revise history.</p>

          <p>A new, sprawling tent facility for detaining immigrants at Fort Bliss military base in Texas is facing calls for its immediate closure from Democratic lawmakers and human rights advocates. The facility, set to become the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention site in the country with a planned 5,000 beds, is criticized for its high cost, lack of oversight, and harsh conditions. Critics argue that using a military base to "cage human beings" is a misuse of resources and a continuation of cruel immigration policies, raising concerns about detainees' access to legal services.</p>
