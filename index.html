Collective responsibility through policies supporting nutritious food, active cities, and clean air is crucial for improving overall health and longevity.</p>

          <p>Global spirit makers are encountering a mix of challenges, including tariffs and shifting consumer preferences. R√©my Cointreau, following Diageo and Pernod Ricard, withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties. The U.S.-China tariff policies and slowing U.S. consumption have particularly affected cognac sales. LVMH's wine and spirits division is underperforming, with Diageo spirits also experiencing declines, reflecting broader pressures on the industry.</p>
