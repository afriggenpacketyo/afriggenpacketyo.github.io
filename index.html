          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after being politically sidelined for years. However, the KMT faces a recall campaign led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that could threaten its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failing to address the recall challenge could disrupt the leadership transition and further fracture the party. Chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor, with the party chair race expected to be announced in July. The KMT hopes for a smooth transition to a new leader by October. Optimism is tempered by the political challenges facing the party. </p>

          <p>A UN nuclear watchdog report reveals that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 294.9 pounds since February. The IAEA expressed serious concern, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state producing such material. The report estimates Iran's overall enriched uranium stockpile at 20,387.4 pounds. The White House stated that Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has sent a detailed proposal to Iran, urging them to accept it. Israel has responded by calling the report a clear warning sign that Iran intends to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>

The victims included Moreno and six people from China, Italy, and California.

          <p>A new TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" of full-fat Coke and salty fries can alleviate migraines, but experts caution against relying on it as a cure. While some individuals find temporary relief from the caffeine and sugar in Coke or the salt in fries, migraine is a complex neurological condition that cannot be cured by fast food. Experts warn that excessive caffeine can trigger migraines and that fast food often contains unhealthy levels of Tyramine, a compound that can also cause migraines. Neurologists emphasize the importance of lifestyle changes and medical treatments over social media hacks, advising people to listen to their bodies and seek professional help.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to spend £1.5 billion on six new munitions and explosives factories as part of its strategic defence review, aiming to enhance war readiness. This investment will support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production capabilities. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up, with UK munitions spending expected to reach £6 billion during this parliament. The opposition has welcomed the investment but calls for greater ambition in rearmament.</p>

          <p>The skulls of 19 Black patients, who died at a New Orleans hospital in the 1870s and were sent to Germany for racist phrenology studies, have been repatriated and laid to rest. The University of Leipzig acknowledged acquiring the skulls unethically and returned them after a two-year process involving city, state, and academic institutions. A multi-faith memorial service and jazz funeral honored the individuals, whose remains had been used to support theories of racial superiority. The event marked an international restitution, highlighting the need to address the lingering presence of African American remains in archival collections across the U.S. and abroad.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on Harvard University, including threats to redirect research funding and review government contracts, citing concerns about antisemitism and bias. These actions have sparked concerns about academic independence and the potential for long-term transformation of American higher education. Accusations of antisemitism and a perceived lack of conservatives among faculty are key reasons cited by the White House. While Harvard is resisting these pressures, other universities are facing similar funding cuts and investigations, leading to fears of an across-the-board war on elite higher education. Some conservatives view these actions as an effort to reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including health, defense, and education. The IFS highlights that increased health spending could lead to cuts in other unprotected areas, given the government's commitments. The government's decision to front-load spending early in the parliament term means that additional funding will slow down. The level of NHS funding will significantly impact the budgets of other departments, particularly with ambitions to improve the criminal justice system. The government has committed to increasing defense spending, which will require further cuts elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into effect across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets are now prohibited from stocking disposable vapes, although rechargeable and refillable devices can still be sold. Disposable vapes have been identified as a major factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes discarded annually. Retailers violating the ban face fines, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping. Vape use has increased significantly in the last decade, with a substantial proportion of vapers using disposable versions.</p>

Over 500 Broadway performers signed an open letter condemning LuPone's remarks, which included disparaging language and perceived racial disrespect. The controversy stemmed from a New Yorker interview where LuPone criticized Lewis and Audra McDonald. In her apology, LuPone expressed regret for her emotional responses and committed to making amends, including personally apologizing to Lewis and McDonald. McDonald stated that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years and was unaware of any rift between them.</p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had received "elements of a US deal" from his Omani counterpart. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated it was in Tehran's "best interest to accept" the deal, reiterating President Trump's stance that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear bomb. The IAEA report revealed that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade level, a matter of serious international concern.

          <p>A new MAHA documentary, "Toxic Nation," focuses on ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, herbicides, and fluoride as key health concerns. The film is aligned with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, led by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The documentary and the movement's policy recommendations aim to reduce chronic disease among American children. Research on ultraprocessed foods links them to various health issues, while concerns about seed oils involve their chemical stability. Glyphosate, a common herbicide, is linked to cancer risks, and the type of fluoride used in drinking water raises concerns about heavy metals.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist warns that China’s quantum satellite, Micius, is potentially vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays, according to researcher Alexander Miller, could provide "ample opportunities" for eavesdroppers to exploit the system. Quantum communication, which relies on quantum physics-based cryptography, is theoretically unhackable. However, flaws in the experimental implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) devices can make them susceptible to side-channel attacks. Miller's analysis of data from Micius revealed time delays between the lasers on the quantum transmitter, indicating a security vulnerability.</p>
