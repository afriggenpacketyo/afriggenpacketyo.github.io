          <p>Fire crews are battling a vast and rapidly spreading moorland blaze across 10 square miles of Langdale Moor in North Yorkshire, an effort severely complicated by the unexpected discovery and detonation of unexploded World War Two ordnance. Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson confirmed over 18 explosions have occurred as the fire consumed peat, forcing firefighters to adopt a defensive strategy and call for national assistance. The incident, which has more than doubled in size due to adverse weather, has led to local evacuations and road closures, with the community, including farmers, providing crucial support. Residents express profound fear for their homes and livelihoods amidst what they describe as an unprecedented summer wildfire.</p>

          <p>A horrific mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 17 others, including 14 children, sustaining injuries during a morning Mass. The gunman, in his early 20s, fired dozens of rounds through church windows before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, in what authorities describe as a deliberate act of violence. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara stated they are investigating to determine a motive, while Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey expressed profound grief over the tragedy. The community is left reeling as the first week of school is marred by this devastating event.</p>

          <p>An analysis of U.S. container data reveals varied tariff mitigation strategies among retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below, reflecting their specific product categories and customer bases. Abercrombie & Fitch diversified its supply chain and pulled forward freight, but still anticipates a $90 million tariff hit, double its initial estimate. Best Buy, less reliant on China, front-loaded freight in June, while discount retailer Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, leverages its flexible inventory to seek better prices. Industry experts expect tariffs to be a greater headwind in the latter half of the year, with the ultimate impact resting on consumer price sensitivity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary stated the measure is intended to deter a small minority of passengers from flouting size limits, emphasizing that the airline is not trying to "catch people out" but rather enforce existing regulations for efficiency. While passengers are allowed a free small carry-on, larger bags can incur charges up to £75, with the airline's rules set to adjust slightly in September due to new EU regulations. O'Leary insists that compliance with these rules will lead to faster boarding processes and fewer flight delays across the network.</p>

CEO Fran Horowitz noted efforts to clear old inventory and expand into new categories and international markets for Abercrombie, while Hollister's Y2K assortment continues to drive strong performance. The company aims for a return to growth for the Abercrombie brand by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has reportedly suspended over 20 staff members who signed an open letter criticizing President Donald Trump's administration over funding cuts and alleged interference. The letter warned of potential "national catastrophes" akin to Hurricane Katrina due to the agency's direction and workforce reductions. A FEMA spokesperson defended the reforms, stating the agency is focused on disaster survivors, not "broken systems," and that "change is always hard" for those resistant to it. The suspensions come amidst renewed scrutiny of US disaster readiness following recent deadly flooding in Texas and ahead of an expected busy hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, carries significant financial risks that can permanently reduce one's retirement income. This article highlights three key downsides: a permanent reduction of monthly benefits by approximately 6.7% for each year before full retirement age, missing out on delayed retirement credits that increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and a potential reduction in survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests strategies like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, utilizing home equity options, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize benefits. Delaying by even a few years can substantially enhance financial security in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

Davey argues that Trump, with his influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gulf states, holds the power to secure a ceasefire and hostage release, but has chosen not to. While acknowledging the importance of the US-UK alliance and engaging with the President, Davey feels a responsibility to highlight the suffering in Gaza and pressure Trump to act. This refusal, though against his instincts, aims to send a strong message to both Trump and UK Labour leader Keir Starmer.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novartis has warned that NHS patients in the UK will lose access to innovative new treatments due to escalating costs and a breakdown in drug pricing negotiations with Health Secretary Wes Streeting. Novartis claims the UK's assessment methods for drug value are outdated and that the current rebate rate, significantly higher than in other European countries, makes the UK "largely uninvestable" for major new investments. The firm has already been unable to launch several medicines for public reimbursement in the UK, which are available elsewhere. Streeting, however, vows not to let firms "rip off" taxpayers, while the industry calls for changes to assessment methods and lower payment rates.</p>

          <p>Patients taking the weight-loss drug Mounjaro are experiencing difficulties obtaining their prescriptions, as demand surges ahead of a significant price increase by manufacturer Eli Lilly on September 1st. The drug's price for a month's supply of the highest dose is set to rise by up to 170%, prompting Eli Lilly to warn against "inappropriate stockpiling" and ask UK distributors to halt new pharmacy orders. Pharmacies are prioritizing existing patients, with supplies expected to normalize post-September. Patients like Lynne Massey-Davis express stress and health worries due to supply disruptions, while experts advise against panic buying and seeking medical supervision for alternative treatments.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive explanation of tariffs, defining them as taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of a product's value, which companies may pass on to consumers. President Donald Trump has introduced a sweeping global program of tariffs, arguing they boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit, while accusing other nations of unfair trade practices. His policy, however, has introduced volatility into the world economy and led to price increases for US consumers. The article details various tariffs on specific goods and countries, noting that while some deals have been struck, many international postal services have temporarily suspended parcel deliveries due to new rules.

          <p>Prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have failed to secure a felony assault indictment against Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol agent, according to sources. This development follows a similar failure to indict another individual, Sidney Reid, in a separate case involving an FBI agent, leading to a misdemeanor charge instead. The video of Dunn's confrontation had gone viral, prompting a public relations blitz from the White House and Justice Department touting his arrest. Under the Speedy Trial Act, prosecutors have a limited window to pursue an indictment or opt for misdemeanor charges or drop the case.</p>

          <p>Poland's new President, Karol Nawrocki, has vetoed a government bill to extend social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees until March 2026, creating uncertainty for about one million Ukrainians in Poland. Nawrocki, advocating a "Poland first, Poles first" policy, argues that benefits should be restricted to those employed in Poland and criticized the current system for allegedly favoring Ukrainians in healthcare access. This move, which has drawn strong criticism for its "anti-Ukrainian face" and potential negative economic impacts, also jeopardizes Poland's funding for Ukraine's Starlink service. The president's decision is seen as an attempt to weaken Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government and pave the way for a conservative return to power.</p>

Hassett defended President Trump's authority to remove a Fed governor "for cause," a legal requirement for such an action. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, maintains that Trump's attempt to fire her lacks factual or legal basis. The dispute, which could ultimately reach the Supreme Court, highlights a significant legal and political battle over the independence and composition of the central bank.</p>

A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the plea and immediately alerted the police, leading to her rescue.

          <p>Scientists have discovered an extraordinary armored dinosaur, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, distinguished by its meter-long spikes protruding from its neck, earning it the nickname "punk rocker" of its time. Living 165 million years ago, this species is the oldest known ankylosaur, a group of armored dinosaurs, and its elaborate spikiness is forcing experts to rethink their evolutionary theories. Researchers, led by Professors Richard Butler and Susannah Maidment, found the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, a unique feature. The discovery suggests ankylosaurs might have initially developed elaborate armor for display in the Jurassic period, later adapting it for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous.</p>

          <p>A landmark federal ruling is imminent that could dismantle Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially costing Alphabet over $26 billion annually, with $20 billion going to Apple. While Google risks losing some search traffic, analysts suggest this could ultimately benefit the company by freeing it from costly deals that no longer drive demand, allowing it to redirect funds towards AI and cloud initiatives. The Justice Department's antitrust case, which found Google holds a search monopoly, aims to open the market to competitors, though past European rulings show Google's market share remains robust even without exclusive deals. The evolving landscape of generative AI is seen as a new frontier where Google aims to solidify its dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
