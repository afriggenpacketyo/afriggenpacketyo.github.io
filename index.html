          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Eases to Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:39:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's July inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, as the city-state prepares for anticipated slower economic growth later this year. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, falling below economists' projections. This moderation is primarily attributed to a decline in retail and other goods prices, alongside reduced electricity and gas inflation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore forecasts that inflation will remain "moderate" in the near term, citing global crude oil price stabilization and contained food commodity price increases. This economic shift, coupled with a "downshift" in the global trade environment, has already led the central bank to ease monetary policy twice this year to support the trade-dependent economy.</p>

          <h2>Trump Criticizes Senate 'Blue Slip' Tradition, Urges Grassley to Challenge Democrats on Judicial Nominees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 01:23:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, labeling it an unconstitutional affront to his appointment power and alleging it grants Democrats undue veto power over his judicial and U.S. Attorney nominees. He urged Senator Chuck Grassley to abandon the century-old custom, which Grassley defends as a norm preserving state input and balance. Trump's frustration stems from a significant slowdown in his judicial appointments during his current term, contrasting sharply with his first. This public pressure campaign, including a direct message to "go to HELL" for Democrats, aims to accelerate confirmations and could profoundly shape the composition of the judiciary in the coming months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. have begun carrying service weapons, marking a significant escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown on what he describes as an "epidemic of crime." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Joint Task Force-DC to arm personnel, who are authorized to use force only as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm. This development unfolds despite local officials reporting a decline in violent crime rates over the past year and a half, contradicting the President's claims. The Guard's role has primarily involved protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, with no prior reports of threats necessitating weapons.</p>

          <p>Global labor markets are transitioning from the "Great Resignation" to a "Great Stay," characterized by fewer employees leaving jobs and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze by employers. This significant shift, observed in both the U.S. and U.K., is driven by prevailing economic insecurity and uncertainty, prompting workers to remain in their current positions. Concurrently, firms are delaying hiring decisions, not necessarily to reduce staff, but due to an unclear economic outlook. While U.S. jobless claims remain near historical lows, nonfarm payroll growth has slowed, and U.K. job vacancies have fallen significantly across most sectors. This trend underscores businesses' reluctance to embark on new hiring until greater confidence in the economic trajectory is established.</p>

This strategic move aligns with China's broader efforts to consolidate its state-owned carmakers and enhance sector competitiveness. Despite reporting a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries for the first half of 2025, the company saw a significant 33% increase in sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models, with the VOYAH series experiencing an 84.8% surge.

The road's design, which frequently switches between single and dual carriageways, is cited as a major factor, encouraging dangerous overtaking maneuvers and hazardous right turns across traffic. A long-standing government commitment to dual the entire 113-mile Inverness-Perth stretch by 2025 has been significantly delayed by a decade to 2035, sparking widespread frustration and urgent calls for accelerated action. Victims' families share their devastating experiences, while lorry drivers and campaigners underscore the critical need for the full dualling project to enhance road safety.</p>

Former energy minister Charles Hendry, a skeptic, believes the UK's complex geology and strong public opposition make fracking significantly more difficult and expensive than in the US.

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged over 14% in Hong Kong, extending gains for a seventh consecutive session, following the unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV. Priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, the new ES8 is Nio's most affordable model, a strategic move amidst intense competition in China's electric vehicle sector. Historically targeting the high-end market, Nio is now proactively expanding its market reach with two new, cheaper brands, Onvo and Firefly, designed to capture a broader range of urban and mass-market customers. Deliveries for the new ES8 are slated to begin in late September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India fears China's planned mega-dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet could drastically reduce water flows to India's Brahmaputra by up to 85% during dry seasons, prompting Delhi to fast-track its own dam project. This concern stems from fears that China, a strategic rival with territorial claims in Arunachal Pradesh, could weaponize water control, impacting over 100 million people downstream. India's proposed Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam aims to mitigate these effects by storing water for dry periods and absorbing potential surges from Chinese infrastructure. However, the project faces fierce local resistance from indigenous communities fearing displacement and environmental destruction, highlighting complex geopolitical, environmental, and social challenges.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump threatened to investigate former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie after Christie criticized him on ABC’s ‘This Week,’ specifically questioning the credibility of Ghislaine Maxwell's statements about Trump. Trump, via Truth Social, invoked Christie's past "Bridgegate" scandal, suggesting it warranted a renewed investigation and asserting that "NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!" Christie, a former Trump supporter, had also expressed skepticism about the FBI raid on John Bolton's home, linking it to Trump's stated intent to use the Justice Department for retribution against critics. This public threat underscores Trump's ongoing campaign to silence and target political opponents, raising concerns about the politicization of justice.</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate rising to 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the national average and its highest in over a decade. Disparities are stark, with Black infants more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and these racial gaps have widened. The state's plan includes expanding prenatal services in underserved counties, creating a regional obstetric care system, and strengthening home visiting programs. Experts caution that structural inequities like poverty and access to healthcare are key drivers, and federal funding cuts to vital maternal and child health programs could further hinder efforts to address this tragic crisis.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer outlines his Monday market playbook, noting a powerful rally driven by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals at Jackson Hole, which hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's shift was primarily influenced by a dramatic deceleration in hiring, which outweighed his concerns about tariffs. Cramer argues that tariffs' inflationary impact has been muted, absorbed by manufacturers and retailers rather than fully passed to consumers. He identifies housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs) as bullish undercurrents responding strongly to the "don't fight the Fed" analysis. Cramer also provides specific stock recommendations across various sectors, while cautioning against enterprise software and autos. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a grim milestone after its spectacular collapse under immense debt. Once China's largest real estate firm with a $50bn valuation, Evergrande defaulted in 2021, leading to a winding-up order in January 2024 and wiping over 99% from its market valuation. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined $6.5m and banned for life for overstating revenue. The crisis, along with issues faced by other developers, has severely impacted China's economy, leading to massive layoffs, decreased household wealth, and suppressed consumer spending, despite government efforts to revive the housing market.
