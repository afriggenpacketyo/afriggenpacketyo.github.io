          <p>A massive explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major commercial port in Iran near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least eight deaths and over 750 injuries. The blast caused significant damage to nearby buildings and vehicles, with residents reporting feeling the impact up to 50km away. Initial reports suggested the explosion was due to a fire spreading to containers storing flammable materials, but later investigations indicated it may have involved solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. The incident prompted the closure of schools and offices in the region, raising concerns about the safety and storage of hazardous materials at the port.</p>

          <p>The Gran Abuelo, an approximately 5,400-year-old alerce tree in Chile, faces a threat from a proposed highway that would cut through its protected rainforest habitat. This ancient tree is not only one of the oldest in the world but also a valuable source of climate data, with its rings providing a record of weather patterns stretching back millennia. Scientists warn that the road increases the risk of wildfires, which could devastate the endangered alerce population.

The decision comes amid pressure from Western and Arab allies for the Palestinian Authority (PA) to reform and take on a larger role in the governance of Gaza post-war.

The Liberal Party's lead has narrowed since the start of the campaign, but pollsters suggest their current position still favors a victory. Due to the distribution of votes nationally, the Liberal Party is likely to win more seats in the House of Commons, even if the national vote is tied, potentially securing Carney's full term as prime minister.</p>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" and "sex" as biological.

It also acknowledges that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use, suggesting mixed-sex or lockable single-person facilities as alternatives.
