          <p>President Trump is considering military action against Iran, demanding Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's "unconditional surrender" in the ongoing conflict with Israel. This consideration follows a Situation Room meeting with national security advisors where a range of options were discussed. Trump has warned Khamenei that the U.S. knows his location, expressing dwindling patience and emphasizing the desire to avoid civilian casualties or harm to American soldiers. Trump's ultimate goal is to force Iran into complete submission, escalating tensions in the region. The situation remains volatile as the U.S. weighs its next move. </p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court. The arrest occurred outside the federal immigration court, with video footage showing masked officers approaching and handcuffing Lander after he requested a judicial warrant. The Department of Homeland Security stated Lander was arrested for "assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer," though formal charges are unclear. This incident follows a similar event where Sen. Alex Padilla was handcuffed after questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, raising concerns about the administration's treatment of dissent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing its highest number of measles cases since 2019, with over 1,100 infections reported across 32 states, and a significant outbreak in West Texas has resulted in two child deaths. Measles, a highly contagious disease, can lead to severe complications like pneumonia, brain swelling, and death, especially in unvaccinated individuals. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, with kindergarten vaccination rates dropping below the critical threshold of 95% needed for community immunity. Despite past controversial statements, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. now encourages measles vaccination, highlighting the importance of immunization to combat the outbreak.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of artificial intelligence and data centers is projected to significantly increase electricity consumption in the U.S., potentially leading to higher electricity bills for households. Data centers, which house thousands of computer servers, require substantial power for operation and cooling, with AI-driven searches using ten times more electricity than normal internet searches. Utilities are already factoring in the increased demand from data centers into their pricing models, and some are considering new rate classes for high-energy users. This surge in demand could also strain the reliability of the electrical grid, according to experts.</p>

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, are urging the Supreme Court to quickly review their challenge to President Trump's tariffs, citing the significant impact on businesses and consumers.

The companies seek a decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighs in, proposing arguments be heard as early as September or October. The lawsuit is separate from another challenge that was temporarily blocked but later reinstated, highlighting ongoing legal battles over Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Channel smugglers are adopting new tactics by using "taxi boats" to pick up migrants waiting in the sea off the French coast, making it harder for police to intercept them. These boats launch from hidden locations and cruise along the coastline, collecting migrants who are waiting in waist-deep water, often including women and children. French police are struggling to intervene due to operational rules that prioritize avoiding drownings, and they fear legal repercussions if they cause panic. The smugglers' evolving methods, including threatening local farmers, present ongoing challenges for law enforcement trying to prevent the crossings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco is reviewing the legality of President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles to assist federal immigration authorities, facing arguments from both the Justice Department and California. The Justice Department contends that the president's decision to federalize the National Guard is beyond judicial review, while California argues that Trump overstepped his authority by not considering less drastic measures and circumventing Governor Newsom. The case stems from a district judge's ruling that Trump's actions were illegal, prompting the administration to appeal, and the judges appeared skeptical of both sides' arguments during the hearing.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a significant majority. While the law still penalizes those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. The new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, such as time limits and the need for two doctors' approval.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old Houston man, Hiep Nguyen, lost his $500,000 life savings in an elder scam after a caller impersonating the Vietnamese Embassy claimed he needed to rearrange his finances due to alleged money laundering. Nguyen, who had received a legitimate IRS warning about identity theft, believed the scammer and followed their instructions over five months, eventually transferring his savings. He is now selling his house to pay off debts and faces the prospect of working until he dies, as retirement is no longer feasible. Elder fraud is on the rise, with elderly Americans losing billions annually to scams like government impersonation, romance, and lottery scams.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign DNA, leading to doubts about the original verdict. The prosecution conceded that the DNA evidence was different in quality and quantity than what was presented at trial. Though initially retried, the charges were ultimately dismissed due to insufficient evidence, prompting Dorotik to file a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>

          <p>While Israel's attention is directed towards its conflict with Iran, the death toll in Gaza continues to rise, with Tuesday marking the deadliest day in recent weeks for Palestinians seeking food aid. Health officials report at least 59 people were killed by Israeli military drones and artillery fire while attempting to reach food distribution sites, exacerbating the extreme hunger and risk of famine in the territory. Israel maintains that its restrictions on aid are to prevent it from benefiting Hamas, but critics argue that these measures are causing severe suffering for civilians. The UN has called for an end to the current system of aid distribution to prevent further casualties.</p>

          <p>The conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified, with civilians caught in the crossfire and facing dire conditions. Israel's strikes on Iran, aimed at preventing nuclear weapon development, have resulted in civilian casualties, while Iran's retaliatory missile attacks have also caused damage and loss of life. Destroying Iran's underground nuclear sites poses a significant challenge, and Israel's long-term objectives remain unclear. The potential for U.S. involvement looms, as Israel may require American assistance to significantly degrade Iran's nuclear program, raising concerns about further escalation and regional instability.</p>
