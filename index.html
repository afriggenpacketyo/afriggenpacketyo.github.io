          <p>Emergency crews in the San Bernardino Mountains successfully rescued a hiker who fell approximately 25 feet onto rocks at Big Falls. The rescue was initiated after another person heard cries for help from the popular but treacherous waterfall area. Due to the serious injuries and difficult terrain, a helicopter was used to hoist the victim to safety and transport him to a trauma center. Officials have reminded the public to exercise caution and stay on designated trails, noting that rescues are common at this location.</p>

          <p>Many Ukrainian refugees who arrived in the U.S. following the 2023 invasion are facing an uncertain future as their two-year work permits are set to expire. The Trump administration has not renewed the program, leaving them in limbo and potentially jobless, despite being valued employees in communities facing labor shortages. Advocacy groups and employers are calling for an extension, arguing that it is not yet safe for refugees to return to war-torn Ukraine. Without the ability to work legally, many may be unable to afford to stay in the U.S.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly linked to a 62% jump in screenings for this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. While experts view this as promising news for early detection and treatment, they caution that screening rates remain suboptimal. The findings highlight the positive public health impact of preventive care guidelines.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic legislators have fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map that would heavily favor the GOP. In response, Republican leaders, including the House Speaker, have voted to issue civil arrest warrants to compel their return, though their enforceability out-of-state is questionable. The standoff is part of a larger national battle over redistricting, with Democrats arguing the proposed map is an unfair gerrymander prompted by Donald Trump. The move has stalled a special legislative session that also includes disaster relief and other key issues.</p>

          <p>Following the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner by President Trump over a large downward revision of recent job numbers, experts are clarifying that such revisions are a normal part of the process. The BLS issues preliminary reports for timeliness and later refines them as more complete survey data becomes available from businesses and households. While the recent revision of 258,000 jobs was larger than average, former officials and analysts state it is a feature, not a failure, of the statistical process. They assert the commissioner has no power to manipulate the numbers for political purposes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Progressive House Democrats Urge Trump Administration to Formally Recognize Palestinian Statehood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:13:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of over a dozen progressive Democrats in the House of Representatives is urging the Trump administration to officially recognize a Palestinian state. Led by Congressman Ro Khanna, the letter argues that the current tragic conflict highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and rights. The letter also states that a viable Palestinian state would need to recognize Israel and guarantee its security. This move aligns with recent pledges from allies like France and Canada but contrasts with the Trump administration's position that such recognition would "reward Hamas."</p>

          <p>Fire crews on Maui responded to a brush fire burning above the Ka'anapali resort area, near the location of the catastrophic Lahaina wildfires from two years ago. The fire prompted the closure of a major highway as smoke impacted the area, but officials reported that the blaze was slowly being contained. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing fire risk in the region, which is still recovering from one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history. No major damage or injuries were immediately reported from this new fire.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a proper headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Despite his international renown and association with figures like Marcus Garvey, Bruce was buried without a marker in 1924, an oversight attributed to his modest finances and the subsequent Great Depression. A community effort using private and public funds has now commissioned a black granite headstone to honor his legacy. The tribute aims to correct a historical oversight and recognize his significant contributions to Black history and culture.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, but the court ruled the government cannot disregard laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This change reopens access to humanitarian protections, though migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The Trump administration had credited the ban for a record drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>California is on track for a more severe wildfire season than in recent years, with over 220,000 acres burned so far, well above the five-year average.

The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, has scorched over 65,000 acres and is exhibiting erratic, plume-dominated behavior. With a major heat wave forecast, officials warn the risk of large, fast-growing fires will likely increase across the southern half of the state.</p>

          <p>In a post-sentencing interview, Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson discussed the immense pressure of the Bryan Kohberger case and the decision to accept a plea deal. Thompson explained that the deal, which resulted in four life sentences without parole, provided finality for the victims' families by waiving all appeals. He stated a confession was not required because he believes Kohberger would only offer self-serving statements that would further victimize the families. Thompson described the crimes as "brutal" and said he saw "nothing" in Kohberger's eyes during the emotional victim impact statements.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that California Democrats are preparing a measure that would "trigger" a redrawing of the state's own congressional maps if Texas Republicans successfully pass their partisan redistricting plan. The plan would put a proposal before California voters in November to temporarily allow the legislature to draw new maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. Newsom framed the move as a direct response to what he called a "Trumpian power grab" in Texas. The outcome of this interstate political battle could significantly impact control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly leading a coup attempt after his 2022 election loss. The court's decision came after allies broadcast a live call from Bolsonaro at a rally, defying a ban on him using social media or having his remarks shared by third parties. The order also prohibits him from receiving most visitors and mandates the seizure of his mobile phones, escalating the legal pressure on the former leader.</p>

Descendants also report high rates of illness, but struggle to get official acknowledgment due to the difficulty of scientifically proving a generational link.</p>

China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling over 85% of processing and 90% of the production of permanent magnets. As the U.S. and its allies seek to reduce this dependency, developing countries with significant rare earth reserves are becoming a new geopolitical front line. However, analysts note that Western efforts to build alternative supply chains have so far lacked the necessary investment and technical expertise to challenge China's position effectively.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to reverse a Biden-era policy that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the health of the veteran. In a new filing, the administration called the existing policy "legally questionable" and aims to roll it back, even in states where abortion is banned. While care for miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies would continue, critics argue the change will deny essential healthcare to veterans.
