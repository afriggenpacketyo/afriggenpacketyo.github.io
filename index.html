          <p>A proposed 50% tariff on copper imports, set to begin August 1, is raising concerns among economists about potential inflation. The tariff targets a metal essential for numerous products, including appliances, electronics, electric vehicles, and infrastructure components like electrical wiring. Experts warn that the increased cost of copper will likely be passed on to consumers, making home repairs and many goods more expensive. The administration argues the tariff is necessary for national security and to rebuild the domestic copper industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, reversing a recent, temporary pause on some shipments. The President stated the aid is necessary for Ukraine to defend itself amid ongoing conflict and high casualties. The decision comes after the White House confirmed a halt in some weapons transfers as part of a broader review of military stockpiles. The move follows recent calls between the U.S. president and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its key interest rate steady at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, amidst signs of economic strain. The country's economy recently contracted, impacted by weak construction and slowing export growth. Authorities are also concerned about financial stability due to a rapid expansion of household loans driven by spiking housing prices in Seoul. The economic situation is further complicated by potential U.S. tariffs on South Korean imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, a significant escalation in trade policy. The justification provided links the tariff to what the administration calls a "witch hunt" against former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup plot. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that any such tariff would be met with reciprocal measures and warned against interference in Brazil's judicial system. This targeted action marks a departure from broader tariff strategies.</p>

          <p>A tentative three-year contract agreement has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike. The strike, involving 9,000 workers including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, had led to piles of uncollected trash across the city. The new agreement includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is much less than the union's initial demands. Workers returned to their jobs immediately, and the union members are expected to vote on the contract soon.</p>

          <p>This commentary article explores how Pixar's animated film "Elio," while not explicitly political, resonates with the current climate of fear among Latinos due to U.S. immigration policies. The author argues that the story of a Latino boy who feels alienated and dreams of leaving Earth speaks to the experiences of many children witnessing the impact of ICE raids. The piece suggests the film's poor box office performance might be partially linked to Latino families feeling unsafe to go to public spaces like movie theaters. It ultimately frames the film as a source of hope for Latino children.</p>
