          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:01:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was likely targeting the NFL headquarters, according to New York City's mayor. Investigators found a note on the shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, in which he claimed to suffer from CTE, a brain injury associated with contact sports, and blamed the league for his condition. The attack resulted in the deaths of four individuals, including an NYPD officer and a Blackstone executive, before the gunman took his own life. The incident has prompted the NFL to increase security and allow New York-based employees to work from home.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked several large California counties to provide personal information of non-citizens who were registered to vote and later had their registrations cancelled. This request, sent to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, seeks details like driver's license and social security numbers. The move is seen by critics as part of a broader administration effort to find evidence of voter fraud, a phenomenon that studies show is exceedingly rare. Voting rights advocates express concern that this focus shifts resources away from protecting against voter discrimination.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level trade talks in Stockholm, the United States and China have agreed to extend a mutual pause on imposing new tariffs on each other's imports. While no major breakthroughs were announced, officials from both nations expressed satisfaction with the progress made. China's Vice-Minister of Commerce, Li Chenggang, confirmed the agreement to continue the suspension of reciprocal tariffs. This development suggests a temporary de-escalation in the ongoing trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, though the duration of the extension was not specified.</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock fell significantly despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The decline was driven by investor concern over slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a crucial indicator of the company's profitability. While total payment volume and active accounts saw modest increases, the growth in this key margin metric decelerated from the previous quarter. The company also experienced rising operating expenses and a notable drop in adjusted free cash flow, signaling underlying financial pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

This article suggests that the novel's depiction of "chosen family" offers a powerful model for building meaningful connections based on intention rather than inherited obligation. By focusing on kinship as a deliberate act of love and loyalty, the story provides a vision for how people can combat isolation in an increasingly atomized world.</p>

          <p>Prominent American mining entrepreneur Robert Friedland has voiced his approval for the incoming 50% tariff on copper imports into the United States. The billionaire founder of Ivanhoe Mines told the BBC that the import tax would be beneficial for re-establishing the domestic copper mining industry and strengthening national security. Friedland argues that the policy correctly focuses on ensuring the U.S. has stable access to critical raw materials rather than relying on foreign sources. This perspective contrasts with critics who warn that such tariffs will be inflationary and raise costs for consumers and manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated and public calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, economists widely expect the central bank to hold its benchmark rate steady at its upcoming meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained that with a solid labor market and lingering inflation risks from new tariffs, no immediate rate cuts are necessary. The administration's pressure on the independent central bank has created a tense backdrop for monetary policy decisions. Most analysts believe a rate cut is more probable at the Fed's September meeting, depending on how economic data evolves. (not investment advice)</p>
