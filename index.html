          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is still fighting for what he believes is a rightfully deserved military pension, a battle he began in the 1980s. Williams says that a conversation with his brother-in-law revealed a discrepancy in their pension amounts despite similar service records; Williams received a discharge date in 1970, while his brother-in-law received one in 1972, a change in military pension rules in the intervening two years would have substantially increased Williams' pension had he been discharged later. Despite appeals and support from MPs, the Ministry of Defence maintains that Williams' pension reflects his correct entitlement based on the rules at the time of his discharge; Williams feels bitter about his treatment and hopes speaking out will bring attention to his case and encourage other affected veterans to come forward. He intends to contact his current MP to continue his campaign.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies ten factors, which he dubs the "Trump discount," that he believes are negatively impacting the stock market, with the primary cause being the unpredictability of the White House. He argues that this uncertainty is driving investors to look elsewhere, even to Europe, despite the strong performance of American companies. Cramer points to specific sectors like Nvidia, retail, drug companies, and food stocks as examples of areas where the market is being held back. He also notes the impact on major tech companies like Apple and Google, as well as the banking and energy sectors, and mergers and acquisitions, due to the current administration's policies and actions.

          <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported that at least 21 people were declared dead upon arrival at its field hospital in Rafah, Gaza, following an incident near an aid distribution center, with women and children among the 179 cases treated. The majority of the injured suffered gunshot or shrapnel wounds, with all patients stating they were trying to reach an aid distribution site. The ICRC noted that this was the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the hospital's establishment over a year ago, surpassing its 60-bed capacity. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that an initial inquiry indicated its forces did not fire at civilians near the aid distribution site, but the situation on the ground remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Police in Boulder, Colorado, responded to an attack at the Pearl Street Mall, where multiple people were injured, and a suspect was taken into custody. While details were initially unclear, authorities reported that the injuries were consistent with burns and occurred near a pro-Israel demonstration. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" and "ideologically motivated violence," though local police have not yet labeled it as such. The attack took place on the eve of the Jewish holiday Shavuot and involved an incendiary device thrown at participants in a Run for Their Lives walk, an event aimed at raising awareness about the hostages in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Dozens of wildfires across Canada have forced the evacuation of over 25,000 residents in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, with ongoing hot and dry weather conditions exacerbating the situation. Manitoba declared a state of emergency, and the fires have knocked out power to some communities, with resources stretched thin as officials worry about the potential for fires to grow and threaten communities. Smoke from the wildfires is drifting into the U.S., leading to air quality alerts in the Upper Midwest. The U.S. is sending firefighters and equipment to assist Canada, and officials are hoping for a change in weather patterns and soaking rain to alleviate the crisis.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists are reporting severe shortages of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (Pert), which is essential for patients with pancreatic cancer, cystic fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. The shortage is causing patients to ration their medication by skipping meals, leading to weight loss and reduced ability to cope with treatments like chemotherapy. The Department of Health and Social Care has extended a serious shortage protocol for Creon, but pharmacists argue that alternative drugs are also in short supply. The department attributes the shortage to European-wide supply issues caused by limited availability of raw ingredients and manufacturing capacity constraints, but experts predict shortages will continue into next year.</p>

Ukrainian security sources claim the attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to execute, with drones smuggled inside mobile wooden cabins carried by trucks. The drones targeted airfields, including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, with the Security Service of Ukraine claiming the operation destroyed 34% of Russia's fleet of air missile carriers. This attack comes as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site, and Zelenskyy is sending a delegation to Istanbul for ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing to accept the pardon she received for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot, citing her belief that accepting it would validate a false narrative. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, is reportedly the only January 6 defendant to reject clemency offered by Trump. She maintains that those involved were guilty and that the pardons contribute to a false narrative. Hemphill sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally acknowledge her non-acceptance of the pardon, and the Department of Justice has noted her decision.</p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie discusses the increasing trend of censorship in America, noting that it now comes from both progressive and conservative voices. He argues that while censorship is often supported in theory to protect vulnerable groups, it can be a slippery slope that ultimately harms those it intends to help. Rushdie, who has faced censorship and threats himself, emphasizes the importance of hearing from voices that may offend, as they challenge individuals and society. He expresses concern that people are more familiar with the threats against him than with his extensive body of work.</p>

          <p>A surprising number of Hollywood stars hail from Australia, a country with a population smaller than Texas, leading to an exploration of how this island nation produces so much acting talent. Factors include the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), which provides rigorous training and a "can do" attitude, and the Sydney Theatre Company, offering a platform for emerging talent. Aussie soap operas also serve as valuable training grounds, and Australian actors are known for their work ethic and down-to-earth attitudes. The remoteness of Australia allows actors to develop their skills away from the intense scrutiny of Hollywood.</p>

The FBI has been monitoring the group "Scattered Spider," known for social engineering attacks, including those on MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. These young, English-speaking hackers are partnering with Russian groups like BlackCat, who provide malware and experience, creating a powerful force multiplier. The Russian government's tolerance of ransomware gangs, as long as they don't target Russian entities, further exacerbates the problem.</p>

While the ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions may still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>
