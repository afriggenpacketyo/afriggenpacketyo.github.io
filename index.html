          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its sixth day, the Senate is preparing for crucial votes on stopgap funding measures. Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse, publicly blaming each other for the failure to reach a compromise. A Democratic-backed bill, which includes health care provisions, is expected to fail, likely prompting another vote on a Republican-supported 7-week measure that has already passed the House. The continued political gridlock leaves the timeline for reopening the government uncertain as both parties hold firm to their positions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned less than a month after his appointment, citing the unwillingness of political parties to compromise in the nation's hung parliament. This move plunges France into a deeper political crisis, marking the fifth prime minister to serve in under two years. Opposition parties, including Marine Le Pen's National Rally, are now demanding early elections. Lecornu's departure underscores the severe instability and legislative gridlock that has plagued French politics since the 2024 snap elections failed to produce a clear majority.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 million Apple and Samsung smartphone users in the UK could be eligible for a payout of around £17 each if a consumer group's lawsuit against Qualcomm is successful. The campaign group Which? is accusing the US tech giant of anti-competitive practices, alleging it overcharged for its chips and licensing fees, which inflated handset prices for consumers. The case, which is now at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London, could take years to conclude but aims to secure a total of £480 million in damages for affected customers.</p>

          <p>The National Institutes of Health has issued $50 million in grants for its Autism Data Science Initiative, aimed at improving the understanding of existing treatments and their outcomes. Cornell University received a $5.1 million grant to lead a center that will validate the research from all other projects. This funding occurs amidst the administration's controversial public health agenda, which has included promoting debunked theories about the causes of autism. Despite concerns about political influence, autism research experts have expressed relief that the funded projects are taking sophisticated, science-based approaches.</p>

          <p>CBS News is set to appoint Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, as its new editor-in-chief as part of a broader acquisition by Skydance Media. The move is widely interpreted as an effort by the network's new ownership to appeal to a more right-of-center audience and counter accusations of liberal bias. Weiss, who has no broadcasting experience, will reportedly partner with the current president, Tom Cibrowski. Her appointment comes as Skydance aims to fulfill commitments to ensure a greater diversity of viewpoints across the network's programming.</p>

          <p>A growing number of bipartisan lawmakers are publicly stating they will reject their paychecks as the federal government shutdown continues. Representatives from both parties have written to the House's Chief Administrative Officer to have their pay withheld. However, due to the Constitution and the 27th Amendment, members of Congress cannot legally forgo their salary entirely. The funds can be withheld during the shutdown, but they must be paid back to the lawmakers once the government reopens, making the gesture largely symbolic.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Australia have filed an appeal against the sentence given to Erin Patterson, who was convicted of murdering three relatives with a poisonous mushroom meal. They argue that her sentence of life in prison with a non-parole period of 33 years is "manifestly inadequate" for the crimes. Patterson, who also attempted to murder a fourth person, will be in her 80s before she is eligible for parole. Her own legal team has also indicated an intention to appeal her conviction, setting the stage for further legal proceedings in the high-profile case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that females outlive males across 72% of mammal species, suggesting the longevity gap is an evolutionary trait millions of years old. Researchers point to a combination of factors, including genetics, the protective effect of having two X chromosomes, and behavioral differences. Males in many species engage in riskier behaviors to compete for mates, which comes at a survival cost. The study also found a correlation between caregiving and longer life, suggesting that human males could potentially narrow the gap by adopting healthier behaviors and reducing risks.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops from Texas and California to Portland, Oregon. The ruling follows a previous decision that denied the administration's attempt to deploy Oregon's own National Guard. The judge stated there was no evidence that recent protests justified the presence of federalized troops, arguing the deployment would risk state sovereignty and inflame tensions. The decision is part of an ongoing legal battle over the president's authority to use military forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix stock indices surged to record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party elected staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader. Her victory, which positions her to become the country's first female prime minister, was welcomed by investors who anticipate her administration will maintain an accommodative monetary policy and pursue economic expansion. The market rally was widespread, with significant gains in real estate, technology, and industrial stocks, while the yen weakened past the 150 mark against the US dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After the first quarter of the NFL season, several teams are facing significant disappointment relative to their preseason expectations. The New York Jets remain the league's only winless team, plagued by poor coaching, penalties, and a historic lack of defensive takeaways. The Baltimore Ravens, meanwhile, have dropped to 1-4, with their chances of making the playoffs dwindling due to a porous defense, even with the expected return of Lamar Jackson. The Cincinnati Bengals' season also appears to be in jeopardy following the season-ending injury to their star quarterback, Joe Burrow.</p>

          <p>Filmmakers from both Israel and Palestine are encountering significant obstacles in securing international distribution for their work, even for award-winning films. The polarized political climate surrounding the war in Gaza has made distributors in key markets like the U.S. and Germany hesitant to take on movies from the region. This affects not only Palestinian stories about displacement but also Israeli films, which face boycotts and funding cuts from a government critical of the industry's often left-leaning perspectives. The situation highlights the increasing difficulty of sharing nuanced narratives from the conflict.</p>

          <p>A group of 176 Zambian farmers has filed a lawsuit against two local subsidiaries of state-owned Chinese mining companies, alleging an "ecological catastrophe." The suit claims that a tailings dam collapse in February released acidic waste that contaminated streams, rivers, and farms, destroying their livelihoods and causing health problems. The farmers assert that the spill violated their constitutional rights and that they were not properly warned of the danger. The case presents a dilemma for the Zambian government, which maintains strong economic ties with China.</p>

          <p>Police in Western Australia have seized 135 firearms and revoked or suspended 44 gun licenses from individuals identified as holding sovereign citizen ideologies, which reject government authority. The crackdown was prompted by the fatal shooting of two police officers in another state by a suspect believed to hold similar views. Officials used bolstered gun laws to target license holders who, through their anti-government statements, were deemed not to be a "fit and proper person" to own firearms. The operation reflects growing concern over anti-authority movements in the country.</p>

Gavin, who was backed by the Fianna Fail party, pulled out following questions about his failure to return a rent overpayment to a former tenant nearly 20 years ago. His withdrawal leaves independent lawmaker Catherine Connolly, supported by most of the opposition, to face off against ex-minister Heather Humphreys, who is backed by the Fine Gael party, in the election for the largely ceremonial role.</p>

          <p>A recent terror attack at a synagogue in Manchester is intensifying a national debate in the UK about the core tenets of 'Britishness,' particularly concerning protest and free speech. The Home Secretary pleaded with pro-Palestinian groups not to protest in the immediate aftermath, labeling such actions "un-British," while others argue that curbing protests is itself contrary to British values. The incident has brought difficult questions about antisemitism, Islamophobia, tolerance, and the balance between democratic freedoms and national security to the forefront of the political conversation.</p>
