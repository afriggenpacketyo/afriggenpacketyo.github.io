          <p>Cardiologists recommend walking regularly to improve heart health, with at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity. This breaks down to about 30 minutes a day, five days a week, to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Shorter walks can also support heart health, and individuals can enhance their walks by incorporating speed walking intervals, increasing distance, or walking on trails.</p>
