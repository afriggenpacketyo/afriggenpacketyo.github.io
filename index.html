        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mezcal, a traditional Mexican spirit, is experiencing a surge in global demand, elevating it from a local drink to a premium product. The article highlights the story of the Hernandez brothers, fourth-generation mezcaleros in Oaxaca, who returned from the U.S. to expand their family's artisanal distillery, Mal de Amor. Their partnership with the Ilegal mezcal brand, now acquired by Bacardi, illustrates the industry's rapid growth while trying to maintain traditional, handcrafted production methods. The story chronicles the spirit's journey and the economic transformation it brings to local communities, and sadly notes the recent passing of the family patriarch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game broadcast, ESPN host Elle Duncan made an off-color joke about the lack of defense, comparing it to a "girls' trip to Cancun" where there's "no D." The comment drew immediate, mixed reactions on social media, with some viewers criticizing it as crude and unprofessional, while others found it humorous. The incident occurred during a high-scoring game where defense was minimal, a common feature of all-star events. The on-air moment quickly went viral, adding to the public discourse surrounding the WNBA's increasing media visibility and the standards of sports commentary.</p>

          <p>An AI-powered tutor named Khanmigo, developed by Khan Academy with OpenAI's technology, is being piloted in over 200 U.S. school districts. The tool acts as a Socratic-style learning assistant for students and helps teachers with lesson planning, saving them significant time. It is designed with guardrails to prevent cheating, instead guiding students to find answers themselves. The platform also includes a feature that can detect if a student is discussing self-harm and alert school staff, a function that has already been used to intervene. While still a work in progress, Khanmigo represents a potentially transformative technology for personalized education.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Price of Children," reveals a Vatican-run program from 1950 to 1970 that sent thousands of Italian children, born to unwed mothers, to the U.S. for adoption. The article details how these children were often falsely declared orphans, with mothers being misled or coerced into giving them up, sometimes being told their child had died. Many mothers who placed their children in church-run institutions temporarily were devastated to find they had been sent overseas without their consent. The investigation, based on church archives, exposes the lifelong trauma for adoptees and their birth mothers who were victims of the era's social stigma.</p>

          <p>A 9-year-old Canadian girl, Melina Galanis Frattolin, was found deceased in Ticonderoga, New York, following a report from her father that she had been kidnapped. The initial claim led to a massive search and an Amber Alert, but police quickly identified major inconsistencies in the father's account. Investigators have since stated that they do not believe an abduction occurred and that there is no wider threat to the public. The father, Luciano Frattolin, is now being questioned as the investigation shifts to focus on the true circumstances surrounding his daughter's tragic death, with State Police taking lead on the case.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to close its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a significant downsizing effort. This move is framed by the Trump administration as a way to streamline operations and save nearly $750 million, while reallocating some scientific functions to other departments. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have fiercely condemned the decision, warning it will severely impair the agency's ability to use science to protect public health and environmental safety.

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, teaching children self-connection—the ability to understand their own emotions and needs—is the single most important skill for a successful life. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their inner voice, leading to insecurity and anxiety. Fostering self-connection builds emotional resilience, supports healthy boundaries, and promotes authentic confidence. The author provides practical tips for parents, such as validating emotions, modeling self-awareness, and focusing on a child's intrinsic qualities rather than just their achievements.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the difficult position American companies face in China amid ongoing trade tensions. In an exclusive interview, he expresses concern that discussions between the two nations have been overly focused on tariffs, overlooking other critical business issues. Stein suggests that a recent 90-day pause on new tariffs will likely be extended, as a return to high-tariff conflict is undesirable for both sides. He also notes a potential path toward de-escalation if the U.S. reciprocates China's move to restrict fentanyl precursors, though no such action has yet been taken.</p>

The author notes that Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, but Australian media and political opposition framed it as a capitulation or indulgence. More significantly, the author contends that by publicly challenging China over the potential sale of the Port of Darwin, Albanese undermined his own efforts to present Australia as a reliable destination for Chinese investment.

Littler stated that he put in extra practice time for the event and was glad to see it pay off. He will next face Dutchman Jermaine Wattimena in the last 16, as he continues his quest for another major title in his breakout career.</p>

          <p>After a commanding four-shot victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler humbly played down his achievement, insisting he is not "anything special." Despite winning his fourth major and drawing comparisons to Tiger Woods from his peers, Scheffler reiterated that his family and faith are more fulfilling than professional success. He stated that while winning is a cool feeling, it does not satisfy the deepest desires of his heart. The 29-year-old celebrated the victory with his wife and 14-month-old son, Bennett, expressing hope that his son will one day enjoy golf as much as he does.</p>

          <p>President Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal story claiming Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned of negative economic reactions and pointed to the Fed's likely interest rate cuts as reasons to keep Powell. In a social media post, Trump called the story "untruthful" and asserted that he makes his own decisions regarding the market and the economy. The situation highlights ongoing tensions between the White House and the politically independent Federal Reserve over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Wolff, who wrote the bestseller "Fire and Fury," noted that many of the women fit a specific mold: long hair, above-the-knee skirts, and high boots. He further claimed that these staffers, past and present, often bear a resemblance to Melania Trump, citing Hope Hicks, Alina Habba, and Margo Martin as examples. The observation touches on the psychology and visual branding within the Trump administration's inner circle.</p>
