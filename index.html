          <p>This article provides a breakdown of estimated monthly annuity payouts based on different investment amounts and the age at which payments start. The payouts vary depending on whether the individual is male or female, due to differing life expectancies, with men generally receiving higher monthly payouts. It explains that the older you are when you purchase an annuity, the larger the monthly payments will be, because the insurer anticipates making payments for a shorter period. The article also discusses when an annuity might be a worthwhile investment, particularly for those seeking guaranteed income and peace of mind in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Staffers at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), founded by Elon Musk, are reportedly worried about their futures after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump. Some fear they could become targets of political retribution or that their association with DOGE could become a professional liability. Musk, who recently stepped down from DOGE, and Trump engaged in a heated exchange of insults on social media, leading to calls for investigations into Musk's government initiatives. Despite the feud, the White House maintains that the mission of eliminating government waste will continue, and some tech companies have expressed interest in hiring DOGE alumni.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a medication commonly used to treat menopause symptoms, may also help prevent breast cancer. The study found that the drug significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth in post-menopausal women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Participants taking Duavee also reported fewer hot flashes during the study, and researchers emphasized that the medication is not a treatment for invasive breast cancer or DCIS. While the findings are preliminary, researchers are encouraged by the potential of the drug to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women at higher risk.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price has begun to regain ground after experiencing a significant drop following a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock was up more than 5% in morning trading after closing down 14% the previous day due to Trump's threats to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Analysts believe the tension between Musk and Trump unnerved investors, but remain optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly in the autonomous vehicle sector.

Authorities arrested 48 people and seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, along with boats and cash.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a court order that required the U.S. Department of Education to reinstate employees who were terminated as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that a U.S. District Judge lacked the authority to require the rehiring of the workers, who were laid off in March. The staff reduction was intended to streamline the Department and eliminate discretionary functions, according to the administration. The judge's injunction pointed out that the staff cuts led to the closure of civil rights enforcement offices and the elimination of the FAFSA supervision team.</p>

          <p>The stock market rebounded on Friday following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, which showed the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, and hourly wages increased by 3.9% compared to the previous year, exceeding expectations. This report alleviated investor concerns about a potential collapse in the labor market, which had been fueled by suboptimal reports earlier in the week. The U.S. economy is largely consumption-based, making low unemployment a critical factor for market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital, following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures also entail UBS fully capitalizing its foreign units and potentially reducing share buybacks. The government aims to enhance the stability and attractiveness of UBS, particularly in asset management. UBS has expressed disagreement with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements, estimating that it would need to hold around $42 billion in additional CET1 capital in total.</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices decreased slightly in May from April's high, driven by consumer fears of tariff-related price increases, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. Despite the decrease, prices remain 4% higher than the previous year. While President Trump's tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market. Demand for used vehicles remains strong due to low inventory levels, driven by consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, targeting travelers from several countries, has not generated the same level of protest as his initial ban in 2017, illustrating a growing desensitization to his discriminatory policies.

Critics argue that the ban is part of a demographic-engineering project aimed at excluding immigrants based on their ethno-religious backgrounds, while actual refugees are being denied entry.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal transplants, while promising for restoring gut microbiomes, may introduce unintended health risks. Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could negatively impact immune and metabolic function. The study, conducted on mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, indicates that newly introduced gut flora can "terraform" the recipient's intestinal tract. Researchers suggest that future fecal transplants should use specific, targeted microbes for the intestines to minimize potential risks.</p>
