          <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 10% baseline tariff on imports from many countries and higher tariffs on specific nations like China and the EU, have taken effect, signaling a significant shift away from the post-World War II trade system. The tariffs have already shaken global stock markets, wiping out trillions in value. While some sectors are exempted, many countries are negotiating deals, and the long-term impact on global trade remains uncertain. Some believe the tariffs will boost US industry and address trade imbalances, while others worry about the economic consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese Grand Prix practice sessions were disrupted by multiple grass fires beside the Suzuka track, leading to red flags and concerns about safety. Despite mitigation efforts after initial fires, the issue persisted, prompting the FIA to focus on dampening the grass before qualifying. Lando Norris led the final practice session in a McLaren one-two, with the fires believed to be caused by sparks from cars igniting the dry grass. With rain forecast for the race, organizers are working to ensure the event can proceed safely.</p>

Residents express a preference for American-made goods and are willing to accept potential price increases if it means bringing jobs back to the US. While some industries, like automotive, face potential challenges, steel businesses in the region see an opportunity in the new era of American protectionism.

          <p>Elon Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (Doge) is targeting the Peace Corps, potentially eyeing budget cuts to the agency. A Doge representative visited Peace Corps headquarters seeking access to financial records, indicating a possible review of costs and programs. The Peace Corps, which sends US volunteers around the world for community development, is the latest federal agency to face scrutiny from Musk's team, raising concerns about potential reductions in global aid and development efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration said it mistakenly sent notices to some Ukrainian refugees informing them that their legal status in the U.S. was being revoked. The notices, sent in error, stated that their parole status would be terminated, and they would be subject to removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) retracted the email, clarifying that the Uniting for Ukraine program has not been terminated. While the program remains in place, concerns persist about the administration's broader efforts to dismantle immigration programs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, after a dominant 8-0 start, suffered their first loss of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite a ninth-inning rally fueled by Tommy Edman's two-run homer, the Dodgers fell short, losing 3-2. Baserunning mistakes and a strong performance from Phillies pitcher Jesús Luzardo contributed to the defeat. The loss serves as a reminder that the Dodgers, despite their star-studded roster, are beatable and will face tough competition in the National League pennant race.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors are seeking more than seven years in prison for former Congressman George Santos after he pleaded guilty to federal fraud and identity theft charges. They argue that Santos's "unparalleled crimes" made a mockery of the election system and that he has shown no genuine remorse. Santos's lawyers have not yet responded, and a federal judge is scheduled to decide on the sentence during a court hearing on April 25. Santos was expelled from Congress after it was revealed he fabricated much of his life story.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Elon Musk's DOGE team, has cut funding to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, impacting libraries across the country. The cuts have led to the termination of grants and staff layoffs, potentially crippling a vital funding lifeline for libraries, especially in rural areas. Library officials express concern about the impact on services like summer reading programs and access to technology.

          <p>Gen. Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command, has been fired by the Trump administration. The decision has sparked concern from top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees, who fear it will negatively impact U.S. cybersecurity. Right-wing personality Laura Loomer reportedly played a role in Haugh's firing, and the administration is considering splitting the NSA and Cyber Command. Lt. Gen. William Hartman will serve as acting NSA director.</p>
