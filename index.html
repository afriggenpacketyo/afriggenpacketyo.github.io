          <p>The use of "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is rapidly expanding, with projections showing over 90 million American users by 2025. These services offer consumers interest-free installment plans, presenting a direct challenge to the revenue models of traditional credit card companies and banks. Financial institutions are wary not only of the lost transaction revenue but also because BNPL usage creates a significant gap in a consumer's credit profile, making it difficult to assess their overall creditworthiness. This lack of visibility into short-term loans poses a new kind of risk for the established credit industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road, forcing organizers to cancel the stage for safety reasons and declare the leader, Jonas Vingegaard, the overall winner without a formal ceremony. The protests, which have occurred throughout the race in response to the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team, have sparked a political debate in Spain. Officials are now trading blame over the escalation and disruption of the major international sporting event.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed that the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, Tyler Robinson, lived with a romantic partner who is transitioning from male to female. While investigators are exploring this as part of a potential motive, Cox emphasized that Robinson's family described his ideology as very different from their own conservative views, stating he was deeply involved in "dark places of the internet." Authorities are piecing together how Robinson may have been radicalized, with friends confirming his immersion in online culture. The governor's comments provide the first public insights into the suspect's personal life as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a recent state law, HB 128, which permits open carrying of firearms on college campuses for those with permits.

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over allegations that he sexually abused her when she was 17. In an interview with the BBC, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences despite being stripped of royal duties. The prince reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability. The family's demand for accountability comes after Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, took her own life in April after years of campaigning.</p>
