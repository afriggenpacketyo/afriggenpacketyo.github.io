The incident resulted in injuries to over 130 people, including multiple children. Doyle appeared in court via video link from prison and was not asked to enter a plea, as his legal team requested more time to review the extensive new indictment.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's characterization of Washington, D.C., as a city overrun by crime, federal data indicates that violent crime has actually fallen to a 30-year low. This gap between perception and reality is a national trend, with polls showing many Americans believe crime is rising even when statistics show otherwise. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has called the president's rhetoric "hyperbolic," while analysts note that policy should be based on data, not feelings, even as they acknowledge the challenge of making residents feel safe regardless of statistical trends.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than many regional peers. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of high inflation outpacing wage growth, expensive housing, and a cultural shift among younger generations who prioritize experiences over long-term savings. Despite a reputation for financial prudence, many Singaporeans find it increasingly difficult to save, with some spending on aspirational lifestyles and utilizing 'buy now, pay later' services, deepening a cycle of debt.</p>

Law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin and Vermont are examining potential connections between McGann and similar unsolved stabbing deaths of hikers in their jurisdictions. McGann, a former teacher, has reportedly confessed to the "completely random" Arkansas murders, and investigators are now exploring if he could be a serial killer. The similarities in the crimes have raised red flags for law enforcement across the country.</p>

          <p>In response to Texas Republicans' plan to redraw congressional maps to their advantage, California Democrats are preparing a countermove. Governor Gavin Newsom has announced an effort to redraw California's own maps, potentially gaining five Democratic seats to offset the GOP's intended gains. This would likely require a special election to amend the state constitution, which currently delegates redistricting to an independent commission. The political battle could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections and control of the U.S. House of Representatives during President Trump's second term.</p>

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed hope that the meeting could lead to peace but emphasized that European powers are actively trying to help shape the agenda for the high-stakes discussion, to which they were not invited.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is strengthening in the Atlantic and is expected to become the season's first hurricane, presenting a significant test for U.S. preparedness. This comes amid concerns that budget and staffing cuts at key agencies like NOAA and the National Weather Service under the Trump administration could undermine forecasting and response efforts. While prediction models have improved, experts worry that reduced resources may create vulnerabilities. The storm highlights the increasing threat posed by more powerful hurricanes, which are fueled by warmer ocean waters linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII approaches, newly declassified documents are providing fresh insights into Japan's infamous Unit 731 and its broader germ warfare program. Researchers are using personnel rosters to trace former members of units that conducted inhumane experiments on prisoners and developed bioweapons. The history remains sensitive, highlighted by the recent unexplained postponement of a Chinese film about Unit 731. The article also notes that the U.S. granted immunity to the unit's leaders after the war in exchange for their research data, a controversial decision that prioritized national security over justice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's call for Texas Republicans to redraw congressional maps has ignited a potential nationwide redistricting battle ahead of the 2026 midterms. In response, Democratic-led states like California and New York are exploring constitutional amendments or special elections to counter with their own gerrymandering. Meanwhile, Republican-led states such as Missouri and Indiana are also considering redrawing lines to favor the GOP. This state-by-state struggle, constrained by varying state laws and tight timelines, could ultimately determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exerting unprecedented control over corporate America, from demanding a share of a private company's revenue to calling for the firing of specific executives. This includes a deal for the U.S. government to take a 15% share of Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China and public criticism of Goldman Sachs' chief economist. Despite these actions, which some analysts liken to state-controlled capitalism, many corporate leaders are remaining silent, seemingly reluctant to criticize the president publicly for fear of retribution. This hesitance is ceding significant influence over the U.S. economy to the White House.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the 0.7% expansion seen in the first quarter but better than the 0.1% forecast by economists. The services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest growth, while business investment and household spending saw declines. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "positive" but acknowledged more work is needed, while critics argue the pace of growth is too slow. Despite the better-than-expected performance, analysts express caution about maintaining this pace due to global economic weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, has completely divested from its U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, liquidating positions worth a total of $1.41 billion in the second quarter. The sell-off included major tech companies like Alibaba, JD.com, and Baidu, marking a significant reversal from the first quarter when the fund had heavily increased its investment in Alibaba. This strategic retreat, which eliminates Bridgewater's direct exposure to U.S.-traded Chinese equities, coincides with growing market volatility and renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China, prompting a reassessment of risk.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, who faked his death and fled to Scotland to avoid prosecution, has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a former girlfriend in Utah in 2008. The conviction followed a bizarre international manhunt that ended with his arrest in a Scottish hospital, where he claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. Rossi was extradited to the U.S. earlier this year to face charges stemming from a DNA match on a decade-old sexual assault kit. He is scheduled to be sentenced in October and faces a separate trial for another sexual assault charge next month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new government initiative in China aimed at boosting consumer spending through loan subsidies may face significant cultural headwinds. Many Chinese households, particularly from older generations, remain deeply averse to taking on debt for anything other than a mortgage. This traditional mindset, which prioritizes saving over borrowing, could limit the effectiveness of the policy. Even among younger consumers, debt-fueled spending is not a popular concept, suggesting that stimulating the economy through consumer credit will be a persistent challenge for Beijing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move aimed at bolstering Pakistan's counterterrorism efforts. Analysts suggest this action could have a positive side effect on China-U.S. relations, as the BLA has been responsible for fatal attacks targeting Chinese nationals and interests in the region. By targeting a mutual threat, the designation may create an opportunity for the two global powers to cooperate on counterterrorism through their shared partner, Pakistan, easing some of Beijing's long-held security concerns.</p>

The Labour government recently reversed plans by the previous administration to scrap funding for 157 of these qualifications, preserving them alongside A-levels and the newer T-levels. This decision was welcomed by school leaders who argued that maintaining diverse post-16 educational pathways is crucial for meeting the needs of all students.</p>

          <p>Secondary sanctions are a foreign policy tool, primarily used by the United States, that extends economic pressure beyond a targeted country to third-party entities that do business with it. Leveraging the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and financial system, these sanctions compel compliance by threatening to cut off access to the lucrative American market. While they were used to bring Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program, their overall effectiveness is debated. Critics argue they can be difficult to enforce, risk retaliation, and may push adversaries closer together.</p>
