          <p>Amazon is considering displaying tariff surcharges on ultra-low-price items sold via its Haul store, but denies any plans to extend this to the main Amazon site. This consideration drew criticism from the White House, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it a hostile and political act, questioning why Amazon didn't implement this during the Biden administration's period of high inflation. Amazon has not implemented any changes on its properties. The White House believes this is just another reason why Americans should buy American.</p>

          <p>Venmo, a service owned by PayPal, is experiencing revenue growth, with a 20% year-over-year increase in the first quarter, though the company did not provide a dollar figure. This growth is attributed to increased payment volume from Venmo debit cards and other specific products like Pay with Venmo at online checkout and instant transfers. While peer-to-peer payments do not generate revenue for Venmo, the company's monetization efforts are gaining traction, addressing investor concerns about competition from rivals like Zelle and Square Cash.</p>

          <p>Consumer outlook has hit its lowest point since 2011, as concerns about tariffs and employment prospects weigh heavily on sentiment. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell sharply in April, with the expectations index indicating pessimism about the near future, reaching levels consistent with a recession. Driving this pessimism is a surge in inflation expectations and heightened fears over tariffs, which reached an all-time high for the survey. In related data, job postings have also fallen, signaling a potential slowdown in the labor market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to provide tariff relief for carmakers, weeks after the implementation of auto levies triggered warnings of price increases. While the 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and parts will remain, the new policy prevents tariffs from stacking on top of each other. Automakers will be reimbursed for tariffs up to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year, gradually phasing out over two years. The administration aims to incentivize carmakers to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Starr County, Texas, faces a disproportionately high rate of dementia, affecting approximately one in five adults on Medicare, more than double the national rate. The community's unique cultural and socioeconomic factors, including poverty, limited access to healthcare, and a high prevalence of chronic conditions, contribute to this alarming trend. Despite the challenges, strong family networks and cultural norms of caring for elders at home provide support and stimulation for those living with dementia. Researchers are investigating the factors contributing to this cluster and seeking ways to mitigate risks.</p>

Five suspected smugglers were apprehended and are in U.S. custody. The Coast Guard has intercepted multiple massive drug hauls in recent months.</p>

Protest music from the mid-1960s became a vital part of pop culture, but its real influence emerged when it left the studio and entered public spaces, building a shared cultural experience.</p>

The issue appears to relate to two separate connection problems in the southwest within moments of each other and then a disconnection from the French network for almost an hour. An increasing number of public figures are blaming a saturation of solar power and an over-reliance on renewable energy. On Monday, Spain was in chaos, but the national power collapse at 12:35 required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.</p>
