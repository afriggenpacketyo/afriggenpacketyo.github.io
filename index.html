Despite the announced truce, explosions and cross-border firing were reported in the disputed Kashmir region.

The ceasefire followed weeks of escalated clashes triggered by a tourist massacre that India blamed on Pakistan. U.S. officials commended both Prime Ministers for choosing the path of peace and starting talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.</p>

          <p>This article from DW examines the challenges facing the new German government, a coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD. The article notes that the government faces a struggling economy, the rise of the far-right AfD party, and the need to address issues such as immigration and social spending. The coalition aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and modernize infrastructure. However, the SPD is resisting drastic cuts in social policy, and the government faces the challenge of balancing investment with fiscal responsibility. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said on public broadcaster ARD that this primarily means dealing with the issues that have "made the AfD big," adding that there is "work to be done.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports that Donald Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The order did not specify how the increase in staffing would be funded, but it calls on the DHS to supplement its current efforts by deputizing and contracting with State and local law enforcement officers. This action comes as the Trump administration pursues multiple pathways to force undocumented immigrants to leave the US, including self-deportation initiatives with bonuses and paid travel. Other deportation methods have been challenged or blocked by federal courts.</p>

The Teal Wand allows women to collect a sample and mail it in for laboratory analysis to detect human papillomavirus (HPV). A clinical trial showed a 96% accuracy rate in detecting cervical precancers, and most participants preferred self-collection at home. The test will be available for women aged 25-65 who are at average risk of cervical cancer, with plans to expand access across the country.

          <p>This CBS News article details the identification of Larry Eugene Parks, who was found dead in Oregon nearly 45 years ago, with police now linking his death to the notorious California serial killer Randy Kraft, dubbed the "Scorecard Killer". Kraft, convicted in 1989 for killing 16 men, is the sole person of interest in the case. Parks, a Vietnam veteran, was last seen in 1979. The identification was made possible through forensic investigative genetic genealogy. Kraft was pulled over in his vehicle on a California freeway in 1983 after a trooper spotted him driving erratically. In the passenger seat of the vehicle was a strangled U.S. Marine. In the trunk of Kraft's vehicle was a coded list believed to tally 67 victims in California, Oregon and Michigan, according to police.</p>

They threatened Russia with "massive" sanctions if it does not comply. Russia has so far insisted that before considering a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine. Zelenksy said that the ceasefire should be unconditional. Macron said the planned truce would be monitored mainly by the US, with help from European countries. He said in the event of violation, "massive sanctions would be prepared and co-ordinated between Europeans and Americans".</p>

The article notes that the southeastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone and the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone. Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the eastern US compared with the west because of the region’s geology.</p>

Under pressure from parliamentarians and media, it later started publishing an updated list of systems and goods supplied.

Faculty are organizing and passing resolutions calling for a “mutual defence compact” to support one another in the face of repressive measures. In Indiana, the recently passed measures, which legislators attached to a budget bill at the last minute, would establish “productivity” quotas for tenured faculty and end alumni’s ability to vote for the university’s board of trustees, which would fall under the full control of the state’s governor, Mike Braun.</p>

          <h2>Barry Diller Reflects on Instinct and Decision-Making in New Memoir</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CBS News article features an excerpt from Barry Diller's new memoir, "Who Knew," where the media executive discusses the importance of instinct in creative and business decision-making. Diller argues that data and research can be harmful to instinct, and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He recounts stories from his career at ABC, including the making of the TV movie "Brian's Song," and emphasizes the value of trusting one's gut feeling over relying solely on data. Overtraining our brains on data alone doesn't confer an advantage, and it can be a deterrent if it's the only decision-making component.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article reports that at least seven people have died and major roads were cut off after heavy rains led to flooding in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, on Friday night. The regional administration spokesperson, Abdinasir Hirsi Idle, told The Associated Press on Saturday that rescue efforts were ongoing. "The death toll could rise because the rains were heavy and lasted for several hours, causing nine houses to collapse across different neighborhoods, and at least six major roads to suffer severe damage," he said. Floodwaters also damaged key infrastructure, halting public transport and temporarily disrupting operations at the main airport, Aden Abdulle International Airport.</p>

Paxton sued Google in 2022 for allegedly unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. The attorney general said the settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits against the search engine and app giant, dwarfed all past settlements by other states with Google for similar data privacy violations.

India accused Pakistan of being involved in the attack; Pakistan denied that claim.

          <p>This CBS News article details the sentencing of Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth offered the victim so-called "investment opportunities" in which she promised at least 10% interest at "no risk" on more than 20 occasions from Dec. 2013 to Sep. 2019. Prosecutors said bank records revealed that Cohen-Roth was running a Ponzi scheme where others who believed they were investing also deposited large sums of money. Cohen-Roth used the money to pay off earlier "investors" and used the rest to support a lavish lifestyle and to make gifts to family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This DW article discusses how climate change is altering bird migration patterns, affecting their ability to feed and breed. Migratory birds play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health by pollinating plants, spreading seeds, and controlling pests. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events threaten their habitats and food sources. Warmer temperatures can also lead birds to shorten their routes or not fly back to their original habitat at all, leading to conflicts over food between migratory birds and resident animals. The article emphasizes the importance of protecting areas and creating bird-friendly environments to support migratory birds.</p>

Planetary lander Kosmos 482 never made it to Earth's sister planet because it was dragged off course after a malfunction in its launch vehicle's upper stage. The mission was to deliver a lander equipped with scientific instruments — including a gamma-ray spectrometer, photometer, and atmospheric sensors — to study Venus's surface and atmosphere. A technical mishap in the upper stage of the launch vehicle meant the probe, also known as Venera 4, never left Earth's orbit and remained in a highly elliptical orbit around Earth for more than half a century before gradually descending.</p>
