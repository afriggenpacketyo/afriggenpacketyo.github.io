          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of its residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected user data. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, this settlement, which covers allegations in two separate lawsuits, is a significant win for Texans' privacy. The settlement follows a similar $1.4 billion settlement with Meta for unauthorized use of biometric data.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing further delays and cancellations for travelers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed a telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display for approximately 90 seconds. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system, including upgrades to telecommunications systems and replacement radars, but these improvements could take up to four years. United Airlines is limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing issues, and officials insist that Newark airspace remains safe despite the delays.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights.

Judge William Sessions stated that Ozturk was detained for expressing her opinion and that there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence.

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington as documents related to his abandoned federal corruption case were released. Adams stated that he planned to discuss New York City priorities, including infrastructure projects. The meeting occurred after the Trump administration moved to shutter the criminal case against Adams, leading to the release of related material, including search warrants and affidavits. The material reveals that the FBI and prosecutors investigated whether Adams committed witness tampering, though he was not charged with that crime. The Justice Department's decision to abandon the case caused an uproar within the department, leading to resignations.</p>

          <p>As Republicans explore extending President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, Trump has signaled agreement with the idea of raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to enable cuts for lower-income earners. Trump stated that this move is "good politics" and a form of redistribution, where wealthier individuals give up a small portion to benefit those with lower incomes. He dismissed comparisons to George H.W. Bush's broken promise of "no new taxes," arguing that Bush lost due to Ross Perot, not the tax statement. Trump acknowledged potential criticism from Democrats but remained open to the possibility of tax increases on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, utilizing drone warfare to enhance their ability to attack and spy on each other. Pakistan accused Indian forces of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting at least three air bases, while India claimed Pakistan sent waves of drones toward Indian airspace. The conflict has escalated since India conducted airstrikes on Pakistan, leading to intensifying exchanges of gunfire, drone attacks, and misinformation. Despite diplomatic pressure, there are no signs that either country is ready to de-escalate, raising concerns about further escalation and casualties.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge detention in court, for migrants. Miller justified this potential suspension by arguing the United States faces a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus and that unilateral suspensions by the President are unconstitutional. The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in extraordinary circumstances, such as an invasion or rebellion, when it is necessary to protect public safety.</p>

The tariffs are hurting both economies, with factory output in China taking a hit and the US economy contracting due to the uncertainty caused by the levies.

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A, a contagious liver infection, with at least seven deaths reported. Cases have been unusually high in 2025, affecting individuals outside traditional risk groups, such as unhoused people and drug users. Officials are investigating potential food contamination and community circulation as possible causes. The infection can incubate for up to seven weeks, making contact tracing difficult, and symptoms can range from mild to severe, with rare cases leading to fatal liver failure.</p>

          <p>Freddy Escobar, the suspended president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles City (UFLAC), is disputing allegations of financial improprieties, including missing receipts for credit card purchases. Escobar claims he has the necessary documentation to account for the expenses, including receipts, meeting minutes, and explanations. The International Assn. of Fire Fighters (IAFF) suspended Escobar and other union officers over the allegations and placed UFLAC under conservatorship. The audit found that Escobar had over $230,000 in transactions without supporting documentation, but he insists the expenses were for union business.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks, prompted by concerns that heat is threatening crops in China’s agricultural heartlands. These purchases mark the first made by China from Australia since last year. The wheat is intended for milling quality. Despite China being the world's top wheat grower, it imports significant quantities when domestic supply falls short of demand. Some analysts have lowered forecasts for Chinese wheat production, but large inventories may limit further purchases.</p>
