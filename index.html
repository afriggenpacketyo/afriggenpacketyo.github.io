          <p>Jurors have started deliberations in the high-profile sex trafficking and racketeering trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs. The jury will review seven weeks of testimony, including graphic evidence and accounts from former girlfriends, to decide on charges that could result in a life sentence. Combs has pleaded not guilty, with his defense arguing the case is about money and that his sexual encounters were consensual, not coerced. The trial's outcome hinges on whether the prosecution successfully proved a pattern of force, fraud, or coercion.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of federal data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has significantly increased its detention of immigrants with no criminal history since May. While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data shows that since early June, non-criminals have outnumbered those with criminal records in new detentions. Overall, only about 8% of all detainees held since January had convictions for violent crimes, with traffic offenses being the most common violation among those with any criminal record.</p>

This potential policy shift aims to balance a hardline immigration stance with the economic needs of vital sectors, though it remains in the planning stages.

          <p>The Ipswich-based punk-rap duo Bob Vylan has been thrust into the spotlight following a controversial performance at Glastonbury that is now the subject of a police investigation. Formed in 2017 by singer Pascal Robinson-Foster and a drummer, the band blends punk and grime with politically charged lyrics tackling racism, police violence, and capitalism. Their provocative style has earned them critical acclaim, including a MOBO award, but their on-stage chant of "death, death to the IDF" has drawn widespread condemnation and triggered significant backlash against the band and festival.</p>

The report highlights that some forces log CCB crimes at three times the rate of others, and more than half of forces are not using an updated risk-assessment tool.

          <p>The U.K.'s public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic has begun its module on the impact to care services, hearing powerful testimony from bereaved families. A barrister for a victims' campaign group stated that the phrase "generational slaughter within care homes," used by a civil servant, accurately reflects the experience of thousands. The inquiry will examine key government decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes in early 2020, which is blamed for seeding the virus among vulnerable residents. Families are seeking accountability for the nearly 46,000 care home deaths.</p>
