          <p>As consumers rush to buy goods before President Trump's tariffs increase prices, economists warn against going into debt. While stocking up on some items may seem logical, experts advise consumers to prioritize their long-term financial health. They suggest avoiding panic buying and unnecessary debt, as the supply chain is currently stable and shortages are unlikely. Experts recommend consumers take a measured approach and consider their long-term financial situation and goals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked international student visas at several California universities, including UCLA, UC San Diego, and Stanford, causing confusion and concern among students and faculty. The reasons for the revocations are unclear, but some speculate it may be related to pro-Palestinian activism or other violations. Universities are working to support affected students, but the lack of communication from the federal government has created uncertainty. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. had revoked 300 visas and would continue its evaluations, targeting student protesters and those with potential criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could trigger a recession, leading to a Republican "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections. Cruz expressed concern that retaliatory tariffs from other countries could damage the U.S. economy and cost jobs. He emphasized his desire for the administration's trade policies to succeed, but defined success as lower tariffs both abroad and in the U.S. Several Republican senators have also introduced legislation to increase Congressional oversight of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Economists are criticizing President Trump's tariff formula, arguing it misrepresents global trade economics. Trump claims the tariffs are "reciprocal" and based on a nation's tariff rates and "cheating," but experts say the calculations are flawed. The White House reportedly used the trade deficit divided by the value of imports, then halved the number for the final tariff percentage. Experts argue this formula doesn't align with modern definitions of trade deficits and is unlikely to achieve the administration's goals.</p>

          <p>While global leaders express concern over President Trump's tariffs, Argentinian President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Trump at a Mar-a-Lago event. Milei attended the event to receive an award and hoped to meet with Trump, emphasizing his libertarian agenda and alliance with the American president. Despite Argentina facing a 10% minimum tariff, officials framed it as preferential treatment. Milei's government aims to reconcile Trump's tariffs with its free trade ideology and seeks a $20 billion bailout from the IMF.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arguing that a federal judge cannot order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 ruling protecting him from deportation. The Justice Department claims that ordering his return would infringe on the executive branch's authority. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues the government has not taken steps to rectify its error, while the White House maintains he is an MS-13 gang member.</p>

          <p>A finalized deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations to a new company with majority American ownership is now uncertain due to President Trump's tariffs.

The deal, led by Vice President JD Vance, involved investors like Oracle and ByteDance maintaining a minority ownership. The future of the deal depends on U.S. and China negotiations on trade.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's aggressive desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark raises serious legal and ethical concerns. His persistent statements and actions, including sending his VP to pressure Denmark, suggest he is serious about acquiring the territory. This could violate American and international law, undermine peace with an ally, and potentially trigger a civil-military crisis. The author argues that senior military commanders have a moral obligation to refuse orders to seize Greenland.</p>
