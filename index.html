          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:58:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a dual legal victory for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a federal judge in Tennessee ordered his release from criminal custody while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges. Concurrently, a Maryland-based federal judge barred Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from immediately detaining him upon release, requiring 72 hours' notice for any removal proceedings. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the Trump administration called an "administrative error" before being returned to the U.S. to face charges. These rulings provide him crucial due process protections against another swift and unexpected deportation.</p>

          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share, driven by strong performance in its Search, YouTube, and Cloud divisions. Overall revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, with Google Cloud revenue increasing by an impressive 31%. Despite the positive results, the company also raised its projected capital expenditure for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion. This increased investment is planned to support the growing demand for its Cloud services and to further expand its artificial intelligence capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal judge has denied a Justice Department request to unseal grand jury materials related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation in Florida. Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that releasing the files would violate grand jury secrecy rules and that the government's public interest argument did not meet the "special circumstances" requirement. The decision comes amid political pressure on the Trump administration to increase transparency regarding the case and follows reports that the president's name appears in related documents. This ruling complicates efforts to release more information, though similar requests are still pending in New York.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to terminate three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), reinforcing the president's authority over independent agencies. The court's unsigned order allows the removal of the commissioners, who were appointed by the previous administration for fixed terms. This decision overturns a lower court's ruling that had blocked the firings and reinstated the officials. The court's three liberal justices dissented, arguing that the majority's action on the emergency docket effectively dismantles the independence of agencies established by Congress to be insulated from political pressure.</p>

          <p>The doctor who provided actor Matthew Perry with ketamine before his death has pleaded guilty to four federal counts of distributing the substance. Dr. Salvador Plasencia admitted to illegally supplying Perry with the drug in the month leading up to the actor's accidental overdose in October 2023. As part of a plea deal, several other charges were dropped, but he still faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Perry died from the acute effects of ketamine, and the case has highlighted the growing, and sometimes unregulated, use of at-home ketamine treatments for depression.</p>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock fell significantly after the company reduced its same-store sales forecast for the year, now anticipating flat growth instead of a previously projected low-single-digit increase. The revision came after the restaurant chain reported a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with a 4.9% drop in the second quarter. While overall net sales rose slightly due to new restaurant openings, the weaker-than-expected performance reflects a broader consumer pullback. However, executives noted that sales trends began to improve in June and have continued positively into July. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon known as "corn sweat" is significantly contributing to the oppressive humidity experienced during heat waves in the American Midwest. This term describes the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release large amounts of moisture into the atmosphere, particularly during hot and sunny weather. While this process can have a localized cooling effect, during extreme heat it dramatically increases the air's moisture content, leading to dangerously high heat index values. This natural process, amplified by monoculture farming, intensifies the severity of heat waves and poses health risks for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers weighing liquidity against guaranteed returns face a key decision between certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A 6-month CD offers a fixed interest rate, ensuring a predictable profit, but requires locking funds away, penalizing early withdrawals. In contrast, a high-yield savings account provides easy access to money but has a variable rate that could decrease with future market changes. Calculations based on current rates show a CD would likely yield slightly more guaranteed interest over six months than its high-yield savings counterpart. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a dramatic increase, rising by more than 42% from approximately $2,409 per ounce in July 2024 to over $3,430 a year later. This significant surge reflects investors' growing concerns about persistent inflation and market volatility, reinforcing gold's traditional role as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge. The consistent upward trend has turned the precious metal into a profitable asset for many, with experts predicting prices could continue to climb. This article suggests that even at current highs, strategic investments in gold can still be considered for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of climate and Indigenous rights activists protested at Wells Fargo's corporate offices, resulting in seven arrests in San Francisco. The demonstrations mark the start of a campaign against corporations for their environmental and political stances, specifically targeting Wells Fargo for its significant investments in the fossil fuel industry. Protesters accused the bank of abandoning its climate commitments and being complicit in financing projects like the Dakota Access pipeline. The actions are part of a planned "summer of civil disobedience" aimed at pressuring the bank to reinstate its climate goals and divest from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has paused debt forgiveness for student loan borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. This temporary hold is a direct result of court orders that have blocked the Biden-era SAVE plan, which introduced new rules for how payment counts toward forgiveness are calculated. The department stated it needs time to adjust its systems to comply with the court rulings before it can resume processing IBR discharges. This delay affects borrowers who are nearing the end of their 20 or 25-year repayment terms and were anticipating imminent loan cancellation.</p>

The sentence was delivered after Kohberger accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, and followed a series of emotional victim impact statements from the families of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves. The judge called Kohberger a "faceless coward" for his brutal crimes and for declining to make a statement or offer any explanation for his motive, which remains unknown.</p>

The shark first bit the man's board before attacking his leg, inflicting two large wounds above the knee. Despite being in open water, the surfer managed to escape and make it to shore, where he received emergency medical treatment and is expected to recover. While shark attacks are uncommon in the region, this incident follows another serious attack that occurred in the Canary Islands last year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially released its AI Action Plan, a strategy heavily influenced by Silicon Valley executives that prioritizes rapid innovation by removing "bureaucratic red tape." The plan aims to secure U.S. dominance in the global AI race by streamlining regulations, expediting permits for infrastructure like data centers, and promoting a pro-growth environment. It also addresses concerns about job displacement by framing AI as a complement to human work and seeks to eliminate perceived ideological bias from AI systems. This approach contrasts with the previous administration's focus on balancing innovation with safety and risk mitigation.</p>
