          <p>South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment offers hope to some beneficiaries, while a federal mandate is not yet in place. The Trump administration has decided not to finalize a rule that would have allowed millions more to access these drugs, citing cost concerns. Despite South Carolina's coverage, stringent prerequisites limit access to a small fraction of the state's obese population, and beneficiaries must prove they have tried and failed to lose weight through other means. Public health experts applaud the decision, but acknowledge that more work is needed to address obesity rates comprehensively.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Andrew M. Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about decisions made during the coronavirus pandemic. This inquiry follows the administration's dismissal of corruption charges against current Mayor Eric Adams, putting the Justice Department in a politically charged position. The investigation stems from a referral by House Republicans, alleging Cuomo made false statements regarding a New York State Health Department report on nursing home deaths. Cuomo's spokesperson has questioned the basis of the investigation, calling it politically motivated.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has allowed a small amount of aid into Gaza for the first time in months, citing pressure from allies concerned about famine conditions. This decision comes as the death toll in Gaza rises, with the Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting numerous casualties from Israeli military strikes. International leaders, including those from the U.K., France, and Canada, have strongly condemned Israel's actions and threatened sanctions due to the humanitarian crisis. Netanyahu defends Israel's actions as necessary for self-defense and the destruction of Hamas, blaming the group for civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for the passage of a budget package containing his legislative priorities, but faces opposition from dueling factions within the party. Conservatives are demanding deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates are resisting cuts to the program and seeking adjustments to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Trump has urged Republicans to support the bill and not let division over SALT or Medicaid derail it, while reiterating that any cuts to Medicaid would only target waste, fraud, and abuse. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to gather subgroups and resolve remaining issues to pass the bill before the Memorial Day deadline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month, impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum. The country's exports grew by 2%, in line with analysts' estimates, but this is the slowest rate since October of the previous year. Automobiles, a key export to the U.S., have been particularly affected by the 25% tariffs imposed in April. The economic slowdown comes as Japan's real gross domestic product contracted in the first quarter, driven by stagnant private consumption and reduced export growth.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that studies on red meat funded by the red meat industry are significantly more likely to report favorable or neutral cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies. The review analyzed 44 clinical trials and found that industry-funded trials often compared red meat to other animal proteins or carbohydrates rather than heart-healthy plant-based proteins. Nutrition experts express concern that industry-linked studies can confuse consumers and undermine nutrition science. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to the National Institutes of Health could lead to more industry-sponsored research, further compromising the credibility of nutrition science.</p>

          <p>The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China has generated cautious optimism in the global economy, signaling a potential step back from a damaging trade decoupling. While the U.S. has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to around 50%, the remaining tariffs still pose a significant challenge to bilateral trade. However, the truce suggests that neither side is willing to completely sever economic ties, offering hope for future resolutions on issues like fentanyl. Many business leaders anticipate that tariffs on Chinese goods will either hold steady or decrease further after the 90-day period.</p>

This action follows warnings of starvation in Gaza due to the Israeli government's blockade of essential supplies. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the military escalation as morally unjustifiable and accused Israel of isolating itself from international partners. The move also reflects growing pressure from MPs, the public, and frustration from the White House over the lack of progress toward a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is accused of illegally deporting two Asian immigrants to South Sudan, a country plagued by conflict, despite court orders prohibiting such actions. The immigrants, one from Myanmar and the other from Vietnam, were initially told they would be deported to South Africa before being informed of their removal to South Sudan. Lawyers for the immigrants filed an emergency motion in court, alleging that the deportations violated due process and endangered the individuals' safety. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

He noted that certain stocks, particularly those related to "fickle consumers" and banks, are more sensitive to bond market fluctuations. Cramer highlighted GE Vernova as a company that can withstand bond market pressures due to multiple secular trends, including the increasing need for energy from data centers and new projects. He emphasized that GE Vernova has secular trends going for it, and that's what is needed to buck the bond voters.</p>

Experts warn that the Republican tax and spending bill could accelerate this trend, pushing the debt even higher in the coming decades. Elevated interest rates and a lack of a clear crisis to justify the borrowing raise concerns about the long-term economic implications.
