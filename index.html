          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 14:44:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is increasing efforts to secure a domestic supply of critical minerals, aiming to counter China's market dominance. As part of this initiative, the Defense Department recently acquired a direct equity stake in MP Materials, the operator of the only U.S. rare earth mine. This public-private partnership model is seen as a new strategy to onshore vital supply chains for national security, particularly for materials used in advanced military technology like F-35 fighter jets and drones. The move is part of a broader $540 million investment to strengthen the U.S. industrial base for these essential resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 2.7% annual rate in June, the highest since February and slightly above the previous month's 2.4% figure. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, driven by rising costs for food and energy. Economists suggest that new tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices in categories like apparel and home furnishings. Despite the uptick, analysts believe underlying inflation remains relatively contained, making a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A transgender woman from Mexico, seeking asylum in the U.S., has been released from an ICE detention facility in Washington. Her release follows an order from a federal judge in Oregon, who ruled that she had been deprived of liberty without due process. The woman, who had been detained for over 40 days, originally fled to the U.S. after being sexually assaulted by cartel members due to her gender identity. Her attorneys stated that she has now been reunited with her family while her asylum case proceeds.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the United States. According to the announcement, the deal would grant the U.S. tariff-free access to Indonesian markets, a significant change from previous trade relations. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has reportedly committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing aircraft.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, are expressing support for President Trump's recent shift toward a tougher stance on Russia. The senators, who have been advocating for strict sanctions, are now willing to give the president's new approach—which includes threatening 100% tariffs—time to work before pushing their own legislation. They view the president's actions as a "game changer" that provides a new tool for pressuring Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. This development signals a potential alignment between Congress and the White House on Russia policy after a period of differing strategies.</p>

The article posits that to compel Russia to negotiate, the U.S. must convince President Putin that a military victory is unattainable by fundamentally changing the conditions on the battlefield. This would require overcoming internal resistance within the administration and creating a dedicated team to manage the effort.

          <p>The family of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen from Florida, is calling on the Trump administration to prosecute the Israeli settlers responsible for beating him to death in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was reportedly trying to protect his family's farm from invaders when he was attacked. His family and advocates from the Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the U.S. government for its perceived indifference to the murder of an American citizen. The incident is part of a rising wave of settler violence that has seen hundreds of Palestinians killed since October 2023.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with net income rising 25% to $4.02 billion. The bank's revenue grew 8% year-over-year, driven by a 16% jump in markets revenue and an 18% increase in banking revenue. CEO Jane Fraser noted that market volatility has been beneficial and that the bank is making progress on its transformation plan. Despite the strong performance, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deteriorating economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that Canada may need to accept the imposition of some U.S. tariffs as part of a new trade agreement with the United States. Carney noted that President Trump's trade negotiations with other countries have consistently included tariffs, suggesting a completely levy-free deal is unlikely. This statement comes as the U.S. threatens a new 35% duty on Canadian goods, escalating a trade war that has been ongoing since Trump took office. While much of the trade is covered by the USMCA, key sectors like auto manufacturing and metals remain vulnerable to the damaging effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for June is expected to reinforce the Federal Reserve's cautious, wait-and-see approach to interest rates. While core inflation was slightly softer than expected, analysts note that price increases in categories like apparel and furniture suggest that President Trump's tariffs are beginning to filter through to consumers. This growing uncertainty over the full inflationary impact of trade policy makes it likely the Fed will remain on hold for several more months. Following the report, investor bets on a July rate cut diminished significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan had improved, but the court granted a one-week stay to review the case. The program protects approximately 11,700 Afghans from deportation and provides them with work permits. Advocacy groups praised the ruling as a critical, though brief, reprieve for families who fled Taliban persecution and would otherwise face being uprooted.</p>

This strategy aims to keep the U.S. one step ahead technologically while still engaging in trade.

          <p>Recent catastrophic flooding events across the United States, from New York City subways to Texas's Hill Country, highlight a growing danger driven by climate change. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainstorms that overwhelm infrastructure and cause deadly flash floods. Scientists have found that the heaviest storms now drop significantly more water than they did decades ago. Many communities are still using outdated rainfall data for planning, leaving them unprepared for the increased risk and hampering efforts to build more resilient infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's recent memo stating there is no "Epstein client list" has caused a significant rift within the MAGA movement and among QAnon conspiracy theorists. For years, the release of these files was anticipated by supporters as proof of a "deep state" cabal of liberal elites, a narrative amplified by pro-Trump figures. The administration's finding that the list doesn't exist has led to accusations of a cover-up from some of Trump's own loyalists. This event highlights how deeply conspiracy theories have become embedded within the political movement and the challenges that arise when official findings contradict long-held beliefs.</p>
