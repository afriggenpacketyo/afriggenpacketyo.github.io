        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has begun releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, resulting in cheaper prices for consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) per 5-kilogram bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out within 30 minutes of opening, highlighting the high demand for the more affordable rice. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes this initiative will effectively curb rising rice prices by selling directly to retailers rather than through auctions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has expressed doubts regarding Russia's dedication to advancing peace negotiations, even as Moscow confirms its team's attendance at talks in Istanbul. Zelensky noted that Russia has yet to submit its negotiating proposals to Ukraine, a critical demand from Kyiv. Despite Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stating that Moscow's ceasefire conditions will be discussed in Turkey, Zelensky accuses Moscow of undermining the peace talks. As the talks approached, both sides reported explosions, leading to casualties and injuries in various regions, underscoring the continued intensity of the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German-Greek relations are facing tension due to differing views on refugee policy, as Germany seeks to return asylum seekers to Greece, a move opposed by Athens. Greece, being an EU external border country, prefers more EU support for border protection and a migration agreement with Libya. While both nations have appointed hard-liners responsible for migration, practical interests diverge, with Greece concerned about the potential burden of accepting thousands of returned migrants from Germany. The German government intends to facilitate deportations based on a court ruling that migrants do not face extreme hardships in Greece.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the global economy through tariffs is facing significant hurdles, including legal challenges and market resistance. A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a battle expected to reach the Supreme Court. Despite Trump's claims that "tariffs are easy," his administration has encountered numerous delays and exemptions, and has been forced to backtrack on some measures due to market panic and warnings about the impact on voters. The court's ruling challenges the administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose blanket tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Trump Remittance Tax to Impact African Migrants</h2>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax bill includes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens, which is expected to significantly impact African migrants. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many African economies, often exceeding aid and foreign direct investment. The tax could lead migrants to seek unofficial channels to send money, reducing transparency and potentially harming lower-income groups that rely on these funds. The US is the largest origin country for remittances globally, making this policy change particularly consequential for Africa.</p>
