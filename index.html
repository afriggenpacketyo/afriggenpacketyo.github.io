          <p>Hamdi al-Najjar, husband of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza, remains in critical condition after an Israeli strike killed nine of their ten children. The incident is under review by the Israeli military, with the Red Cross reporting the deaths of two staff members in a separate strike. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli air strikes have killed 23 people, including a senior rescue service official and a journalist. The IDF said its aircraft struck suspects operating near its troops, calling Khan Younis a dangerous war zone and urging civilians to evacuate. The doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, was at the hospital when the strike occurred.</p>

          <p>Despite pledges to halt fossil fuel funding, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, investing $93 billion between 2013 and 2024. This includes $56 billion in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. Japan benefits from increased access to LNG and reselling surplus, shifting from consumer to exporter. Japan's Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) promotes natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage (CCS) as transitional fuels, which some critics view as greenwashing. A study found that LNG involves more emissions than coal, and loopholes in Japan's G7 pledge allow for continued LNG investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert argues that emotionally safe parenting, which prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, is more effective than traditional methods. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. Practicing this involves reflecting on one's own childhood, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame. By creating an environment where children feel safe expressing their emotions, parents can foster emotional resilience, trust, and connection.</p>

Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held commemorations including a church service, candlelight vigil, and gospel concert. Some feel the national "reckoning" with racism is fading, with President Trump rolling back police reforms.</p>

          <p>Germany's finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, has called for talks with the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from Europe starting next week. Klingbeil warned that the tariffs endanger both the U.S. and European economies. The EU's trade chief, Maroš Šefčovič, said that the bloc is committed to securing a deal that works for both sides and that trade relations must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. The latest threat of a June hike sent stock markets into a tailspin on Friday, amid fears of renewed global economic disruption, with the US dollar also falling in value.</p>

After a period of intense Israeli airstrikes on Syria, the attacks have subsided since Trump's meeting with al-Shara and announcement of plans to lift sanctions. This shift in U.S. policy has undercut Israeli efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor, with Israel now appearing to de-escalate and open dialogue with the Syrian regime.</p>
