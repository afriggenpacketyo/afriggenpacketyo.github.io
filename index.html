          <p>Eli Lilly reported first-quarter revenue and earnings exceeding estimates, driven by high demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. CEO Dave Ricks noted that the threat of tariffs is incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing, but expressed uncertainty about whether tariffs are necessary. Mounjaro's revenue was $3.84 billion, up 113% year-over-year, while Zepbound's sales reached $2.31 billion.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan requiring placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines, a move that could delay the availability of updated COVID shots for the fall. While some scientists see value in understanding potential vaccine effects, they caution against delaying lifesaving shots, which could jeopardize public health. The new initiative also involves the NIH developing new vaccine technologies, potentially displacing mRNA vaccines. Experts warn that holding up authorization for updated COVID shots would be "unacceptable" and could lead to increased deaths.</p>

Some companies view the geopolitical shifts as an opportunity to bolster domestic supply chains and automate factories in the U.S., while others are concerned about increased costs and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's (FA) decision to ban transgender women from women's football has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it effectively excludes transgender women who have played for decades. One trans woman who played men's Sunday League football before joining a women's team expresses her shock at the ban, stating the effect that hormones have had on her means that she does not feel able to compete with men. The FA has offered therapy and suggested mixed-gender football from 2026-27, but critics argue it pushes trans women out of football altogether.</p>

While the agreement, which gives the US preferential access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, is a diplomatic success for Ukraine and includes language condemning Russia's invasion, its impact is limited. The presence of American businesses does not guarantee protection, and the deal does not signal a shift in Trump's relationship with Putin or a commitment to prolong US military aid.</p>
