          <p>President Trump indicated that if the U.S. doesn't reach trade agreements with other countries soon, tariffs would be imposed within weeks, while direct contact with China continues daily to negotiate a deal. Markets rallied following Trump's comments suggesting he wouldn't dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his softened stance on China, indicating a potential shift in economic strategy. However, tariffs on imported goods could cause clients to pause and take a wait-and-see approach to spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik stated that U.S. electricity demand is experiencing its most substantial growth since the post-World War II industrial expansion, driven by economic factors and national security needs. Strazik emphasized the necessity of expanding the electric power system to support economic growth and emerging technologies like AI, also noting that gas will play an important role as hyperscalers continue to build out data centers. GE Vernova's gas arm has sold out gas turbine orders for 2026 and 2027, and posted a quarter that beat the estimates and sent shares climbing.</p>

          <p>A study by Dartmouth College researchers estimates that emissions from 111 fossil fuel companies caused $28 trillion in climate damage between 1991 and 2020.

The research identified the top five emitting companies as Saudi Aramco, Gazprom, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP, collectively responsible for over $9 trillion in damages, though the companies did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record, was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and the Trump administration has cited the tattoos as evidence of alleged MS-13 affiliation, although some gang members do not believe Abrego Garcia's tattoos represent MS-13.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are proposing fines for individuals who play music or videos loudly on public transportation without headphones, referring to them as "headphone dodgers." The proposal aims to address anti-social behavior and enhance the commuting experience, with fines potentially reaching £1,000. The Liberal Democrats plan to amend the Bus Service Bill to incorporate these changes, garnering cross-party support from some Labour and Tory MPs.</p>
