          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy while excavating trenches. The remains, believed to belong to a woman from the pre-Inca Chancay culture, were found remarkably well-preserved with intact dark brown hair. Archaeologists note that such discoveries are common in Lima, a city with hundreds of archaeological sites, due to the region's dry desert climate which aids in natural mummification. This finding adds another piece to the rich tapestry of ancient civilizations that inhabited the area long before the Spanish colonization.</p>

This move angered the Environment Minister, who reiterated the country's commitment to renewable energy. The disagreement extends to plans for new gas-fired power plants, raising concerns about Germany's ability to meet its climate-neutrality goals by 2045. (not investment advice)</p>

He argues that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and operate under a mature regulatory framework. This perspective suggests China can leverage its existing digital payment infrastructure and regulatory experience to stay competitive as stablecoins become more prominent in the global economy.

          <p>The residents of Littlebredy, a village of 32 homes in Dorset, are facing eviction after the Bridehead Estate was sold for approximately Â£30 million to an unknown entity. The new owner, registered as Bridehead Estate Ltd, is linked to a private equity firm, but the ultimate client's identity remains concealed, leaving residents feeling powerless. Access to the estate's grounds has already been terminated, and villagers have been ordered to leave their homes starting in January. The situation highlights the profound impact of concentrated, anonymous land ownership on rural communities in England.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm.

Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, was arrested several times in 2024 amid the allegations. His defense attorney stated that Hoiby takes the accusations seriously but does not acknowledge wrongdoing in most of the cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>The NHL's first semi-remote draft, held with team executives in their home markets, has received criticism for its lack of energy and personal connection. GMs like Ken Holland of the LA Kings expressed a preference for the traditional, in-person format where players and their families could celebrate together in the arena. The new setup, which involved players interacting with team staff via video calls on stage, was marked by technical glitches and an awkward, slow pace. While the league's intention may have been to save on travel, many felt the change detracted from the celebratory experience for the young draftees.</p>

The talks in Washington occurred as a July deadline for President Trump's proposed "reciprocal tariffs" approaches, though there are indications the administration might extend the 90-day pause on their implementation. Japan remains strongly opposed to the 27.5% tariff on imported passenger vehicles, which it deems unacceptable. The ongoing negotiations reflect the complex trade relationship and the challenge of finding a mutually beneficial agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Neuralink, successfully helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature through a neck vein. This development represents a significant potential advancement in BCI technology, promising reduced surgical risk and faster recovery times for patients.</p>
