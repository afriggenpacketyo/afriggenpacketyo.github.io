        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel criticized a former Coast Guard officer, Peter Stinson, for allegedly threatening President Trump, claiming Stinson used language similar to a now-deleted Instagram post by former FBI Director James Comey. Comey's post, featuring shells arranged as "86 47," sparked controversy and Secret Service interest, though Comey maintained it was innocent. Patel argues that Comey's stunt diverted FBI resources and encouraged copycats, leading to more threats against the president. Stinson, a self-identified Antifa member, made graphic threats before and after the post, and while it's unclear how much Comey's post influenced Stinson, Patel insists it created a predictable situation, emphasizing law enforcement's role in preventing violence. The tone of the article is serious, reflecting the gravity of threats against a president and the potential consequences of social media posts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's foreign policy is characterized by a lack of coherent strategy, driven instead by instincts related to self-interest, deal-making, and displays of strength, leading to volatility. While the Republican Party is divided between GOP hawks advocating for forceful global intervention and the "America First" faction favoring domestic focus, Trump's actions do not consistently align with either group. His approach resembles an internationalized version of his New York real estate tactics from the 1980s and 90s, producing a mutually contradictory policy that undermines itself. This inconsistency stems from Trump's allergy to foreign policy doctrine, making him susceptible to influence from those around him and resulting in unpredictable policy shifts.</p>

Kneecap has garnered attention for their provocative lyrics and merchandise, and the group's rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalized film starring Michael Fassbender.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation remained at 3.4% in May, with food prices continuing to rise, particularly for chocolate, which saw a record increase of 17.7% due to bad weather and mismanagement in cocoa-producing regions. Economists speculate that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to consumers, contributing to the rise in food costs. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, but retailers warn that the costs from the Chancellor's Budget could not be fully absorbed. Consumers are becoming more price-conscious, especially young families, leading some businesses to offer discounts for cash payments to offset card machine fees.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the Minnesota shooting that killed Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, was described as a frustrated idealist preoccupied with societal problems. According to Charlie Kalech, who worked with Boelter on web design for his projects, Boelter was passionate and sincere in his beliefs, striving to make his ideas a reality. Boelter had developed sweeping proposals to address issues like American hunger, viewing them as solvable with the right political will. The last project Kalech was engaged for was a multifaceted collection of corporations to help start-up and expanding businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but Kalech became aware that Boelter did not have the funds to continue with the project, leading Kalech to stop working with him.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Israeli strikes targeted two centrifuge facilities at the TESA Karaj workshop and Tehran Research Center in Iran. According to the IAEA, one building at the Tehran site, where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested, was hit. At Karaj, two buildings used for manufacturing different centrifuge components were destroyed. Both sites were previously under IAEA monitoring as part of the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts are debating the legality of Israel's attack on Iran, with some arguing it violates international law, while others claim it was a preemptive act of self-defense against a potential nuclear threat. Under international law, self-defense requires an imminent attack, which some analysts argue was not the case, as no evidence suggests Iran was close to developing a nuclear weapon. Others suggest the attack should be viewed as part of a larger conflict, altering the legal context. The debate also encompasses the laws of combat, including the prohibition of targeting civilians and the requirement to minimize civilian harm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Dietary Guidelines are anticipated to remove the recommendation that adults limit alcohol consumption to one or two drinks per day. The updated guidelines, still under development, will likely encourage moderation or limiting intake due to health risks, but without specific daily limits. While current guidelines advise one drink or less per day for women and two or less for men, the scientific basis for these specific limits is considered limited. This change follows lobbying efforts by major alcohol industry players and varying conclusions from studies on alcohol's health effects, with some linking moderate drinking to increased cancer risk and others to potential cardiovascular benefits.</p>

          <p>Danny Boyle, along with screenwriter Alex Garland, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, and producer Andrew Macdonald, has reunited for "28 Years Later," a sequel to the 2002 film "28 Days Later." The film captures the anxieties of the present, evoking a sense of isolation and despair. The visual style, integral to the experience, includes the innovative use of iPhones for shooting. The new film introduces "Slow-Lows" and "Alphas" to the zombie mythos, and the storyline involves a quarantined Britain where survivors create new societies.</p>

          <p>Eric Bauman, former chair of the California Democratic Party, has died at 66 after a long illness. Bauman led both the Los Angeles County Democratic Party and the state party, expanding their influence before resigning amid misconduct allegations. He was the first openly gay and first Jewish person to chair the state party, and his tenure was marked by significant Democratic gains in the 2018 midterm elections. Despite his later controversies, Bauman is remembered for his tireless work in building the Democratic Party in California.</p>

          <p>California faces a dangerous wildfire season, exacerbated by budget cuts and restructuring at federal agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and FEMA.

These changes include staff reductions, expansion of resource mining in national forests, and potential dissolution of FEMA.

          <p>Los Angeles Metro is facing challenges in securing the $2 billion needed to lease a fleet of 2,700 buses for the 2028 Olympics, a key component of its "transit first" plan.

          <p>A new study suggests that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species move habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, predicting new biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, static creatures like the ocean quahog, a long-living clam, could struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The movement of these species could affect coastal communities, potentially leading to bigger fish catches.</p>
