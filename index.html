          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 22:07:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes after the U.S. began requiring REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or other federally-approved IDs for domestic flights. The TSA emphasized that while they appreciate Costco's offerings, travelers must present REAL IDs, passports, or other approved documents like Defense Department-issued IDs to pass through security. The REAL ID requirement stems from a 2005 law based on recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, aiming to enhance security standards for identification. The clarification is important for travelers to avoid confusion and ensure smooth passage through airport security.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could provide a temporary reprieve for Asian countries navigating the complexities of the US-China rivalry. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, may ease the pressure on these nations to prioritize trade with either power. However, some analysts caution that the detente might also complicate their strategic calculations. Lee Seong-hyon notes that while the call marks a "tentative step back from the brink," the relationship between the two powers remains fragile, highlighting the ongoing challenges for countries balancing relations with both superpowers. This situation underscores the delicate geopolitical landscape in Asia, where nations must carefully manage their economic and security interests.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong continues to be China's leading hub for global finance, surpassing Shanghai due to its strong connectivity to international capital and markets. Despite mainland China's exchanges boasting a combined value of US$10 trillion, companies are increasingly choosing Hong Kong for capital infusions. Yan Jun, chairman of AICT, cited Hong Kong's access to global markets as a key factor in his company's decision to list there. The trend reflects a broader preference among mainland companies seeking offshore capital, particularly as US-China tensions rise, making Hong Kong an attractive and stable launching pad for international expansion. This underscores Hong Kong's enduring significance in global finance.</p>

          <p>The Belmont Stakes is set to feature a rematch of the Kentucky Derby's top three finishers: Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza, although Sovereignty skipped the Preakness. Journalism, fresh off a Preakness victory, enters as the morning-line favorite with 8-5 odds. The race, temporarily held at Saratoga Race Course, will be 1 1/4 miles, deviating from its traditional 1 1/2 miles. Sovereignty, the Derby winner, aims to replicate Thunder Gulch's 1995 feat of winning both the Derby and Belmont, while Journalism seeks to continue his winning streak with jockey Umberto Rispoli.

          <p>A series of ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles triggered protests and strong reactions from elected officials, who criticized the operations as "cruel and unnecessary." Federal agents detained employees inside a clothing wholesaler, using flash-bang grenades and pepper spray on protesters. SEIU President David Huerta was injured and detained while documenting a raid, leading to further condemnation. Officials defended the actions, stating they executed search warrants related to harboring individuals illegally in the country, resulting in 44 administrative arrests and one arrest for obstruction.

Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, reported that "further progress" was made after talks with U.S. officials. Both countries aim to reach a mutually beneficial deal, with Japan advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Japan has proposed joint efforts in areas such as strengthening supply chains and expanding imports of U.S. farm products. The negotiations are set against the backdrop of the upcoming G7 summit, where leaders may seek to finalize a trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is targeting Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over soaring rice prices and an upcoming national election. Ishiba seeks to overhaul the decades-old production adjustment system, aiming to boost rice production and counter opposition parties' proposals to cut the consumption tax. Despite officially ending the "acreage reduction policy" in 2018, production adjustments have continued with subsidies encouraging farmers to grow feed rice. Ishiba's consumer-focused approach includes releasing reserve rice to lower prices, but challenges remain, including the risk of oversupply and potential market turmoil. This move reflects a broader effort to address economic issues and gain political support.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against Sonoma County, California, alleging that its code enforcement's use of drones constitutes a "runaway spying operation." The ACLU, representing three residents, claims the county has used drones with high-powered cameras to find code violations on private property without warrants since 2019. The suit argues that this violates the California Constitution's right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches. Residents report ongoing privacy concerns and reduced enjoyment of their property due to the drone surveillance.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant wrongly deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal human smuggling charges.

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador mistakenly deported in March, has been returned to the US to face federal criminal charges. He is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr. Ábrego García after the US presented an arrest warrant, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous." The White House had been resisting a US Supreme Court order from April to "facilitate" his return after he was sent to a jail in El Salvador alongside more than 250 other deportees.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's escalating feud with President Trump. The company's stock plummeted following the public spat, wiping out billions in value. The conflict could impact future regulations, investigations, and government support for Tesla. Prior to the feud, Tesla was already struggling with declining revenue, increased competition, and consumer backlash to Musk's political activities. The situation underscores the risks of blending business and politics, potentially harming Tesla's brand and financial stability. The board is urged to ensure that Tesla can stand on its own regardless of who's leading the company.</p>

          <p>A former girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, identified as "Jane," testified about feeling pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her discomfort. She alleged that employees helped procure drugs for these encounters, known as "hotel nights." Prosecutors have charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sexual assault, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty. Jane described a financial arrangement where Combs paid her monthly rent and gave her an allowance, which he allegedly used to pressure her into participating in the encounters.

          <p>The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. The money is largely used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. While the Home Office aims to end asylum hotels, Whitehall officials and charities suggest there's little incentive to reduce ODA spending because the money doesn't come from its budgets. This has led to huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world, exacerbated by reductions to the overall ODA budget. The situation has sparked criticism and debate over the use of foreign aid.</p>
