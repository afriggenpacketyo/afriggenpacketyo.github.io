            <p>This article explores the potential inflationary impact of Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports. Economists warn that tariffs could provide companies with a narrative to justify price increases, potentially leading to corporate profiteering, also known as 'greedflation'. Even companies not directly affected by tariffs might raise prices, exacerbating the situation. While Trump supporters view tariffs as beneficial, others fear they will negatively impact consumers and the economy, raising inflation expectations and potentially triggering further price hikes.

            <p>The Chinese government is directing museums to promote ethnic unity and counter 'wrong historical views,' according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums are instructed to avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and to present a unified 'China story' through archaeological findings. This initiative aims to cultivate a 'sense of community' and emphasize the country's diverse yet unified identity, with cultural relics and historical narratives placed within a framework of overall national development. This reflects the government's efforts to shape historical narratives to support its political agenda.</p>

            <p>Following Harvard University's public rejection of authoritarian demands from the Trump administration, officials reportedly attempted to claim the letter was sent by mistake. The letter had ordered Harvard to discontinue diversity efforts, limit protests, install right-wing faculty, and spy on international students. Despite the attempted retraction, the administration proceeded to freeze Harvard's public funding and ordered the IRS to revoke the school's tax-exempt status, escalating the conflict. This incident highlights the administration's aggressive stance towards higher education and its disregard for academic independence.</p>

Teachers reported instances of boys refusing to speak to female teachers and expressing support for Tate's views on women. The Department for Education has acknowledged the issue and is providing support to teachers to address the harmful influence of such influencers.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is seeking emergency intervention from the U.S. Supreme Court to temporarily halt the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members. The ACLU argues the Trump administration is rapidly deporting these individuals to El Salvador without due process, violating their rights. This action follows a Supreme Court ruling that allows deportations under the Alien Enemies Act but requires proper notice and a chance to challenge their cases. The ACLU contends the current process fails to meet these requirements, potentially leading to wrongful deportations and life imprisonment in foreign prisons.</p>

            <p>President Trump has stated the US will withdraw from brokering Russia-Ukraine peace talks if progress is not made quickly, echoing similar sentiments from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This announcement comes amid ongoing Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities and stalled negotiations. While Trump had previously expressed confidence in resolving the conflict swiftly, the lack of progress has led to growing frustration within the administration. The US is also pursuing a minerals deal with Ukraine, aiming to finalize it by April 26, though details remain unclear.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member, had his sentence reduced due to good behavior and rehabilitation efforts in prison. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, aligning with his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration policies. The governor also issued a posthumous pardon to Sgt.

Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government.</p>

While some celebrate the ruling as a victory for common sense, others express concerns about the potential exclusion and discrimination against transgender individuals.
