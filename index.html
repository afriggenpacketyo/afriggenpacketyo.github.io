          <h2>Texas Pushes Back Against Foreign Land Acquisition with New Legislation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent hostile foreign powers, including China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, from acquiring land within the state. The bill targets entities affiliated with governments deemed national security threats, prohibiting them from purchasing real estate that poses risks to public health or safety. The legislation empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals, with exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and personal homesteads. Supporters emphasize that the bill focuses on actions and affiliations, not race or nationality, to protect Texans from foreign espionage and influence.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating tensions, Pakistan and India have accused each other of launching missile strikes on air bases and missile storage facilities, leading to retaliatory actions and heightening fears of a broader conflict. Pakistan claims India initiated the attacks, targeting key installations near Islamabad, while India has yet to comment. The Pakistani military asserts its air force assets remain secure, but the exchange of strikes marks a dangerous escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors, prompting concerns from the international community, and the conflict began after militants killed 26 people last month in India-controlled Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton revealed a $1.4 billion settlement with Google over claims that the tech giant collected user data without permission, encompassing geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data. The settlement, the largest of its kind, signals Texas's commitment to protecting consumer rights and freedoms against Big Tech overreach. Google maintains the settlement addresses old claims and that it has already updated its product policies, clarifying that no new product changes are required as part of the agreement.

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni regarding allegations surrounding their 2024 film, "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson denounces the subpoena as a ploy to generate tabloid attention, emphasizing her minimal involvement with the film, limited to permitting the use of her song "My Tears Ricochet." Lively and Baldoni are embroiled in lawsuits involving allegations of sexual harassment and defamation, with Baldoni claiming Lively's wealthy and influential friends, including Swift, are making things difficult for him.

Despite the show of force, the parade masked Russia's challenges on the battlefield and in the economy, with fewer Western leaders in attendance compared to previous years.

This arrest highlights the ongoing problem of Mexican officials' collusion with organized crime, even as President Trump has proposed using American troops to crack down on cartels.

The spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, covering a wide swath of the Earth, and if any pieces of the spacecraft are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians and artists are urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, requiring transparency from AI developers regarding the use of copyrighted material for training AI models. They warn that failing to provide this protection would essentially give away their work to tech firms, jeopardizing the UK's position as a creative powerhouse. The artists support an amendment proposed by Baroness Beeban Kidron, which aims to facilitate licensing agreements between creators and AI companies. Not everyone agrees with the artists' approach, with some arguing such proposals could hamper the UK and its bid for growth.</p>

          <p>Pakistan said it launched a military operation against India, targeting multiple bases, including a missile storage site, as the neighbors extended their worst fighting in nearly three decades. Pakistan claims India fired missiles at three air bases, including one close to Islamabad, before its offensive. The military operation is named "Operation Bunyanun Marsoos". Sounds of explosions were reported in India's Srinagar and Jammu, where sirens were sounded, and at least 48 people have been killed since Wednesday, according to casualty estimates on both sides of the border.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, allegedly due to her pro-Palestinian activism. Judge Sessions criticized the government's case, stating that the only evidence against her was an op-ed she co-wrote in her student newspaper criticizing the university's response to resolutions approved by the Tufts Community Union Senate. He emphasized her commitment to her academic career and lack of any history of violence or criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, has been released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered her to be freed. The arrest follows the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. Videos of the arrest showed masked plain-clothes officers surrounding her after a Ramadan celebration, handcuffing her and then taking her into an unmarked car. The judge said Ms Ozturk had raised "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment right to free speech and her due process rights were violated.</p>

          <p>State regulators have announced that tap water is now safe to drink in areas served by all nine water systems where damage from the firestorms in Altadena and Pacific Palisades had prompted “do not drink” notices. The last water utility with such a notice, the Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, was cleared to resume delivering drinking water and lifted its “do not drink” and “do not boil” advisory on Friday, four months after the notice was issued. The restoration of service reflects the differences between water utilities but also the considerable effort that each has undertaken.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Amtrak employees conspired with New York medical professionals to swindle the company's health care plan out of over $12 million, according to the Amtrak Office of the Inspector General. Twelve Amtrak employees and three healthcare providers were criminally charged, with some employees accepting cash in exchange for their insurance information. The report highlights a troubling workforce culture in which criminal behavior was normalized. Amtrak is considering disciplinary action for the remaining active employees involved and has taken steps to address medical insurance fraud.</p>
