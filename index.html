          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled, necessitating direct engagement between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite a previous agreement in Switzerland to roll back tariff increases, disagreements persist regarding tech restrictions and rare earth limitations. Bessent remains confident that China will return to the table once President Trump communicates his preferences. The leaders last spoke in January, just before Trump's second term began, and analysts believe China will only agree to another call if there are no unexpected moves from the U.S. side.

Trump also criticized Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society, claiming they provided poor judicial recommendations. The President asserted that his tariffs are essential for a prosperous America, urging the Supreme Court to overturn what he considers a detrimental decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's 129-day tenure in the Trump administration as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has concluded, marked by significant attempts to cut government spending. Musk aimed to slash trillions but claimed to have saved $175 billion through various measures, including asset sales and workforce reductions, although the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. His presence raised concerns about conflicts of interest due to his companies' dealings with the government, and his efforts to cut international aid have sparked controversy. Musk's time in office also highlighted the spread of misinformation, such as unfounded theories about stolen gold reserves.</p>

Her story has gained attention, leading to a heated exchange between a Democratic senator and the U.S. health secretary regarding the impact of the cuts.
