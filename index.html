Homeowners can also consider refinancing a HELOC into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. With HELOC rates on the decline, homeowners should keep these considerations in mind to make an informed decision. (not investment advice)</p>

This heightened vetting includes plans to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students posing national security threats and expanded social media vetting. Bruce framed the new measures as part of President Trump's "America First" agenda, aimed at reducing alleged political indoctrination on campuses and ensuring high-quality education for American students.

          <p>Israel has announced the establishment of 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of existing outposts, drawing condemnation from Jordan and Britain. Defense Minister Israel Katz stated the decision strengthens Israel's hold on the region and prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state. Peace Now, an anti-settlement watchdog, described the move as the most extensive of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords. The international community largely views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel are awaiting a response from Hamas to a 60-day ceasefire proposal for Gaza, according to the White House. Israel has signed off on the proposal, which includes the release of 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages, with aid expected to flow into Gaza. Hamas has confirmed receiving the proposal and is reviewing it. President Trump has expressed optimism about a potential deal, while an earlier ceasefire ended in March due to a failure to agree on terms for extending it.</p>
