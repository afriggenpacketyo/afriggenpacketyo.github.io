          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass instated a curfew for downtown Los Angeles from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, encompassing a one-square-mile area, due to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew aims to prevent vandalism and looting, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and individuals experiencing homelessness. Protests have persisted for five days following immigration raids, resulting in nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses on Monday night. President Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to protect federal buildings, against the wishes of California's governor, leading to legal challenges and accusations of fueling the unrest.</p>

A hiking party reported spotting an ill-prepared hiker avoiding others in the Enchantments area, leading to a helicopter search that identified Decker. Tracking teams and K-9 units followed Decker to the Ingalls Creek Trailhead, while the search continues in the surrounding area. The daughters' cause of death was determined to be suffocation, with evidence of zip ties and plastic bags found at the campsite.</p>

          <p>A UN panel is urging the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the current agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, but the UK retained control of a military base on Diego Garcia. The UN experts argue that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to access their ancestral lands. The panel calls for suspending the current deal and negotiating a new agreement that addresses the Chagossians' rights.</p>

The deal allows Meta to gain expertise from a prominent AI startup without a direct acquisition, potentially avoiding antitrust concerns.

The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report calls for an end to "anti-play culture," noting a 50% decline in outdoor play in England due to traffic, crime concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report recommends a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies and protecting play in schools. The goal is to create child-friendly communities and reverse the growing intolerance towards children playing outdoors.</p>

This structure is attributed to the galactic tide, the gravitational field of our galaxy, twisting the orbital planes of small bodies and comets in the Oort Cloud.
