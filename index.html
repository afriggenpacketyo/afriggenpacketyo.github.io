          <p>Delta Air Lines has issued a fourth-quarter profit forecast that exceeds Wall Street expectations, citing robust demand for luxury travel and increasing airfares. The airline also reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed estimates, with premium cabin revenue growing by 9% while main cabin revenue slightly declined. CEO Ed Bastian stated that the company is well-positioned for continued growth and has not seen any negative impacts from a potential government shutdown. The positive outlook suggests a recovery in travel demand and improved capacity management within the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen successfully overcame two no-confidence votes in the European Parliament. The challenges were initiated by the hard-right Patriots for Europe and the far-left alliance The Left, but neither managed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority for her removal. While the outcome reaffirms her position, the relatively narrow margins of support highlight the increasing difficulty for the European Commission to command a stable majority for passing legislation. This reflects a more fractured European Parliament with growing populist factions on both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>A friendly soccer match between Argentina and Puerto Rico, originally scheduled for Chicago's Soldier Field, has been relocated to Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. While the Chicago Park District cited low ticket sales for the cancellation, an Argentine Football Association executive attributed the move to recent immigration-related unrest in Chicago. The situation in Chicago has involved the deployment of National Guard troops to protect federal personnel amid protests following an immigration crackdown. The relocation allows the Argentinian team, featuring Lionel Messi, to remain in Florida after a preceding match in Miami Gardens.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's shares experienced a significant drop of over 14% after the luxury automaker revised its future guidance and scaled back its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. During its Capital Markets Day, the company announced a new 2030 sales target consisting of 40% internal combustion engine cars, 40% hybrids, and only 20% fully electric vehicles, a reduction from a previous 40% EV goal. This strategic pivot, which the company attributes to a client-focused approach and evolving market conditions, comes as Ferrari prepares to launch its first all-electric model in 2026. The move reflects a broader trend among automakers adjusting EV targets amid market challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Licensing Reforms to Extend Pub Operating Hours</h2>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing laws, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars in England and Wales. The proposed reforms aim to support the hospitality sector by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music. While Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer framed the review as a way to boost local economies, critics have raised concerns that relaxing alcohol regulations could lead to an increase in antisocial behavior. The review will gather evidence on recommendations from a government taskforce, including simplifying rules for outdoor trading and temporary events.</p>

          <p>In Cameroon, 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who has been in power for 43 years, is seeking an eighth term, while the opposition remains deeply fragmented and struggles to present a unified challenge. Biya's most prominent challenger was disqualified, a move critics called politically motivated, further diminishing hopes for a competitive election. Despite a rise in voter registration, public trust in the electoral process is low, and safety concerns in the Anglophone regions threaten to suppress turnout. Analysts believe the opposition is not strong enough to unseat the incumbent, as political maneuvering appears focused on personal gain rather than a collective push for change.</p>

Comey's legal team plans to file motions to dismiss the case on grounds of vindictive prosecution and improper grand jury use. The case highlights the deep-seated feud between Comey and former President Trump and raises significant questions about the independence of the Justice Department.</p>

While offenses targeting Jewish people fell by 18% in this dataset, separate figures from the Metropolitan Police show they were the target of 40% of all religious hate crimes.

Legal scholars point out that there is no formal mechanism for designating a domestic group as a terrorist organization, and such an action could face challenges under the First Amendment's protection of free speech and association.

They identify three major trends: AI could replace genuine communication between elected officials and their constituents, concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few tech oligarchs who may seek to dismantle democratic governance, and further disrupt the information landscape by undermining fact-based journalism. The authors call for rejecting the idea that AI's development is inevitable and urge policymakers to address these foundational challenges to prevent serious damage to democratic processes.</p>

          <p>A Republican group in Pennsylvania is relaunching its campaign, "Republicans Against Perry," to oust incumbent Congressman Scott Perry, a prominent Trump ally and former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. The group is using electronic billboards to highlight Perry's role in the ongoing government shutdown, which affects many federal employees in his district. Perry's seat is considered one of the most vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections, especially without Donald Trump at the top of the ticket. The effort reflects a broader struggle within the GOP between its traditional and MAGA-aligned factions, with this race being a key battleground.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has launched her re-election campaign with a pledge to pursue the truth about UFOs, also known as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). In a fundraising email, her campaign stated that the American people deserve to know what is happening in the skies and should not be treated like children with half-truths from Washington bureaucrats. This focus on UFOs is not new for Boebert, who previously questioned a witness at a congressional hearing about the possibility of secret underwater alien bases. A political analyst described the unusual campaign message as a potential sign of desperation for voter support or funding.</p>

          <p>This article explores the modern landscape of charitable giving, dominated by crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe, where countless individuals plead for help amidst a constant stream of global crises. It highlights the disparity in fundraising success, where a small percentage of campaigns go viral while the vast majority fail, often leaving the most vulnerable without support. The rise of crowdfunding has democratized access to aid but has also created an overwhelming environment for potential donors, leading to compassion fatigue. The article suggests strategies for more intentional giving, such as supporting mutual aid groups and addressing root causes rather than only reacting to immediate emergencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>John Fabian Witt's book, "The Radical Fund," details the history of the American Fund for Public Service, established in 1922 by Charles Garland, an heir who ethically refused his $1 million inheritance. The fund was designed to be spent quickly on unpopular and progressive causes, supporting organizations like the NAACP and ACLU, and financing anti-lynching campaigns and labor movements. This article reviews how the book meticulously documents the fund's significant impact on American civil rights and legal history over two decades with a relatively modest endowment. The story serves as a historical parallel to today's issues of wealth inequality and the power of targeted philanthropy.</p>

          <p>A new report from KPMG indicates that California shoppers are planning to increase their holiday spending, not out of economic confidence, but out of fear of future price hikes due to inflation and tariffs. Consumers on the West Coast show the highest level of concern about rising prices in the country. This preemptive spending strategy suggests a psychological response to economic uncertainty, as people choose to buy now rather than pay more later. The report notes that while spending on essentials has risen, consumers expect to cut back on discretionary items like toys and furniture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film "If I Had Legs I'd Kick You," directed by Mary Bronstein, is described as an intense and anxiety-inducing psychodrama that immerses the audience in the crisis of its protagonist, Linda. Rose Byrne delivers a magnificent and vivid performance as a mother on the verge of collapse due to the overwhelming pressures of caring for her ill daughter with little support. The movie employs extreme close-ups and oppressive sound design to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, drawing comparisons to the Safdie brothers' work. While the experience is purposefully exhausting and unpleasant, Byrne's powerful portrayal makes the character's struggle deeply compelling and unforgettable.</p>

Members of MWEG view their advocacy for a fair democratic process as an extension of their faith.
