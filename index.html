          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murder of their wealthy parents, are fighting for a new trial. Their legal team is presenting what they claim is new evidence, including a newly discovered letter, that supports their long-standing allegations of severe and prolonged sexual abuse by their father. The brothers hope this new information will be enough to reopen their notorious case and potentially overturn their convictions, arguing that the killings were an act of desperation born from years of trauma.</p>

          <p>In a shocking turn of events, Kouri Richins, a Utah mother who authored a children's book about coping with grief, has been charged with the murder of her husband.

          <p>A long-unsolved case took a major turn with the arrest of Rex Heuermann, a Long Island architect, in connection with the Gilgo Beach serial killings.

          <p>The case of Suzanne Morphew, a Colorado mother who vanished on Mother's Day, captivated the public with its strange and disturbing details. The investigation uncovered bizarre clues, including a so-called "chipmunk alibi," a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen, which pointed investigators toward her husband. After his wife's remains were discovered with tranquilizer drugs present, he was arrested and charged with her murder. The case highlights a complex investigation that slowly pieced together evidence to build a case against the primary suspect.</p>

          <p>The case of Ashley Benefield, a former ballerina, culminated in a manslaughter conviction for the shooting death of her husband, Doug. Their relationship, which began with a marriage just 13 days after meeting, was marked by a series of dramatic events, including the chaotic launch of a ballet company, allegations of poisoning, and a bitter custody dispute over their child. Benefield claimed she shot her husband in self-defense during an argument, but prosecutors argued it was a calculated act to gain sole custody. The trial brought to light the couple's volatile history and conflicting narratives of fear and manipulation.</p>

          <p>Turkey has registered its highest temperature on record, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as the country, along with much of the eastern Mediterranean, endures a severe and prolonged heatwave with temperatures far exceeding seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with strong winds and dry conditions, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across Turkey, forcing evacuations and resulting in multiple fatalities as thousands of personnel battle the blazes.</p>
