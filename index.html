        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated he has no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite his repeated criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy. Trump expressed a desire for Powell to be more proactive in cutting interest rates, while also expressing optimism about improving trade relations with China. These remarks followed concerns raised by the National Economic Council about Powell's job security, which had previously triggered market instability. Powell was initially nominated to lead the central bank in 2017 and renominated in 2021, and it remains unclear if Trump has the authority to remove the Fed chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation remained at a four-year low in March, with the consumer price index rising 0.9% year-on-year, driven mainly by increases in food and private transport costs. Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, slowed to 0.5%. This data arrives as Singapore prepares for a general election in May, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledging cost-of-living pressures as a key concern due to global factors such as wars and supply chain disruptions.

          <p>Major U.S. automotive industry groups are joining forces to lobby the Trump administration against imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts. The groups argue that these tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many suppliers are already struggling financially and would not be able to absorb the additional costs. They represent a sector that supports 10 million American jobs and contributes $1.2 trillion to the economy annually. The letter comes after President Trump indicated he might reconsider the tariffs to give companies more time to adjust production.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments suggesting a softening stance on tariffs against China may give Beijing an advantage in trade negotiations, according to analysts. Trump indicated that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced but not eliminated, following earlier remarks about progress in trade talks. Experts believe these comments signal anxiety from the US side and could allow China to secure a more favorable deal. The ongoing trade war has caused volatility in the stock market and concerns about slowing global economic growth.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecasts for major Asian economies, including China and India, citing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The IMF also reduced its global growth forecast, attributing it to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. These revisions align with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies due to the intensifying U.S.-China trade war.

The reforms address concerns that officers who fail vetting checks can remain in their roles on full pay.
