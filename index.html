          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced a third round of nuclear talks in Oman, aiming to establish a new agreement that could prevent further conflict in the Middle East. These discussions, occurring amidst heightened regional instability, seek to curb Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the easing of American sanctions. A successful deal could reshape regional security by reducing the likelihood of military action against Iranian nuclear facilities and opening Iran to foreign investment, potentially transforming its economic and political landscape. President Trump has expressed optimism about reaching an accord, despite having abandoned a previous agreement in 2018.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shahid Rajaei port in southern Iran resulted in five fatalities and over 700 injuries, with initial reports suggesting a connection to improperly handled missile propellant. The incident occurred during a third round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States in Oman, adding to regional tensions. While Iranian authorities denied any link to the oil industry, evidence suggests the port had received a shipment of solid rocket fuel, raising concerns about the cause of the blast. The port has been targeted in the past, including a 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel.</p>

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett casts doubt on Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India as a strategy to reduce costs associated with tariffs, arguing that the supply chain would still be heavily reliant on China. Moffett suggests that any cost benefits would be limited, and Apple could face resistance in diversifying its production. He also notes that carriers are unlikely to absorb tariff costs, potentially leading to decreased consumer demand. Moffett maintains a "sell" rating on Apple, citing valuation concerns and the impact of tariffs on sales in China. </p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, has died at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre had accused powerful figures, including Prince Andrew, of sexual assault when she was a minor. Her family described her as “a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking” and “the light that lifted so many survivors.” The circumstances surrounding her death are tragic, leaving behind a legacy of advocacy for survivors of sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its initiative to create a new academic discipline aimed at stamping out Western bias in ethnic studies. The State Council has approved 15 more universities to establish study programs in "community for the Chinese nation."

          <p>Under President Trump, opportunities for student loan forgiveness have narrowed. The SAVE repayment plan is unlikely to survive, and other repayment plans no longer guarantee debt erasure. Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains intact, though potential changes could impact eligibility. Borrowers should keep records of their payments and employer certifications to ensure they have necessary documentation. Teacher Loan Forgiveness is still an option, but it cannot be combined with PSLF.</p>
