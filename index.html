          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan has stated that she moved to Dubai in 2014 to escape the intense and terrifying experiences she had with paparazzi in Hollywood during her youth. She revealed that these encounters left her with "PTSD to the extreme" and that she wants to protect her husband and son from similar invasive scrutiny. Lohan credits the privacy laws in Dubai for allowing her to live a normal, safe life away from "the noise" of Hollywood. She also noted that the rise of social media has given public figures more control over their own narratives compared to the early 2000s, when she, Paris Hilton, and Britney Spears were relentlessly pursued.</p>

          <p>A major legislative bill signed by President Trump, which extends tax cuts, funds mass deportations, and imposes work requirements for Medicaid, is becoming a key issue for both parties during the August congressional recess. Democrats are highlighting the bill's cuts to safety net programs and its potential to make healthcare unaffordable for millions when ACA subsidies expire. Republicans are promoting its tax relief for working-class voters and stricter immigration enforcement, framing it as a commonsense contrast to Democratic policies. With control of the House at stake in the 2026 midterms, both parties are using the recess to campaign on the bill's perceived benefits and drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has apologized after two blind passengers, Camille Tate and Sherri Brun, were left behind at a New Orleans gate while their flight to Orlando was rebooked. The majority of passengers were moved to an earlier flight from a different gate, but Tate and Brun were not verbally informed and could not see the updated flight information. The airline eventually flew the two women to Orlando on a private flight, but the friends are calling for improved communication protocols for passengers with disabilities. Southwest offered a $100 voucher, stating a full refund was not applicable as they completed their scheduled flight, albeit alone and significantly delayed.</p>

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, known as "el refugio" (the shelter) for processing over half a million Cuban refugees, is reopening after a major refurbishment. A new exhibition, "Libertad," focuses on the personal stories of those who fled Fidel Castro's regime, like Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967. The restored building, now owned by Miami-Dade College, uses technology and artifacts to convey the emotional journey of exiles who started new lives in the U.S. The exhibition aims to preserve these histories of survival and hope for future generations, highlighting the tower's central role in shaping the city of Miami.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "no tax on tips" provision, part of his larger legislative bill, is causing confusion among tipped workers who question its actual benefits. The measure offers a temporary deduction of up to $25,000 on federal income tax for qualified tips, but workers will still owe state and payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Experts and workers note ambiguity around which types of gratuities qualify, such as automatic service charges, and how employers must report them. The discussion comes as tipping averages decline amid consumer "tipping fatigue" and higher service costs, making the potential tax relief a complex issue for the service industry.

          <p>An advice column addresses the dilemma of a person with gastrointestinal issues who finds it difficult to maintain a vegetarian diet but still wants to minimize animal suffering. The article explores different ethical frameworks, contrasting duty-based deontology with consequence-focused utilitarianism and pragmatic pluralism. It suggests a "reducetarian" approach, which focuses on reducing harm rather than complete elimination of animal products. Practical advice includes choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, opting for larger animals like cows over chickens to reduce the number of lives taken, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels on food packaging.</p>

          <p>Mallary Tenore Tarpley's new book, "SLIP: Life in the Middle of Eating Disorder Recovery," explores her personal journey with anorexia nervosa, which began after her mother's death when she was 11. Combining memoir with research, she discusses the challenge of living in a "middle place" between acute illness and full recovery, a concept not formally defined by the medical community. Tarpley advocates for accepting setbacks and reframing recovery as a process of continuous forward momentum, which has allowed her to live a full life while still managing her disorder. The article details her shift from a perfectionist mindset to one of self-grace, a relevant topic amid the resurgence of diet culture.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have been protesting against the government's plan to expand its military operations, fearing it will further endanger the lives of the remaining captives. The demonstrations in cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv call for a deal to secure the hostages' release, even if it means ending the war. Some former soldiers are now publicly refusing to serve, arguing the expanded operation is a "political war." This public and military dissent adds pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose plan has also faced criticism from the army's chief of staff and international allies.</p>

          <p>More than 200 days into his second term, critics and political analysts are expressing growing alarm over what they describe as a clear trend toward authoritarianism under President Trump. Recent actions include calling for the prosecution of his predecessor, firing a government statistician over a weak jobs report, and pursuing a hostile takeover of Washington D.C.'s local governance. Observers note that compared to his first term, Trump and his allies are now more adept at using the levers of power to undermine democratic institutions, challenge the judiciary, and control information. While once dismissed as hyperbole, terms like "dictatorship" are now entering mainstream political discourse to describe the administration's actions.</p>

The article cites the negative impacts of tariffs on the economy, the projected rise in the uninsured, and the devastation of federal agencies like the NIH and FEMA as evidence of reckless and inept governance.

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a chaotic Los Angeles on the brink of a nuclear strike, is experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie has gained a cult following for its affectionate portrayal of the Miracle Mile neighborhood, featuring now-iconic locations like the May Co. building and Johnnie's Coffee Shop. The plot begins as a romance between characters played by Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham before an errant phone call plunges them into a race against time.

          <p>With recycling systems proving confusing and inefficient for many single-use items, the "reuse" movement is emerging as a promising alternative to tackle the waste crisis. A recent pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested a city-wide system where consumers used reusable beverage cups from various stores and returned them to collection bins for washing and redistribution. The program, sponsored by major corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's, saw a return rate over 50%, surpassing the environmental break-even point compared to single-use cups. Organizers found that community pride, rather than monetary incentives, was the key driver for participation, suggesting such models could be scaled successfully.</p>

          <p>As Los Angeles faces intensifying droughts and floods, urban planners are looking to the "sponge city" model, successfully implemented in cities like Bangkok and across China, as a potential solution. This approach uses nature-based infrastructure, such as parks and wetlands with permeable surfaces, to absorb, clean, and store stormwater rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. This method not only mitigates flooding and replenishes groundwater but also creates valuable green recreational spaces. While L.A. has initiated some projects through its Safe Clean Water Program, progress is slow and costly, facing bureaucratic hurdles not present in more centralized systems.</p>

In the first five months of Trump's second term, Texas and Florida had significantly more ICE arrests, both in total numbers and per capita. Experts attribute this to stronger cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in Republican-led states through programs that identify undocumented immigrants in jails. While California saw a dramatic 212% increase in arrests, its "sanctuary" policies forced ICE to conduct more visible and controversial community raids, which in turn sparked strong public resistance.</p>

According to letters received by dozens of applicants, their cases are being closed because they never underwent a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border, a screening that was often skipped due to a shortage of asylum officers during periods of high migration. Immigration lawyers fear this move will strip protections and work permits from people who have been following the rules for years. They also worry their clients could be detained if they report to ICE to request the now-required interview.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures forecast to climb above 30C (86F) in the coming days. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health alerts for most of England from Monday to Wednesday. A peak temperature of 34C (93F) is anticipated on Tuesday in the south Midlands as warm air is drawn up from the south. This marks a significant shift from the recent stormy weather, with England and Wales expected to see the most sunshine, though some scattered thunderstorms are possible. Pollen levels are also expected to rise to high across England during this period.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a surge in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands arriving via new and existing ferry routes. Turkish visitors are drawn to the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to Turkish coastal resorts. Local business owners welcome the influx, noting that the visitors appreciate the food and are friendly guests, fostering goodwill between the two peoples. This positive trend in tourism and cooperation on migration stands in contrast to ongoing political disputes between Athens and Ankara over maritime borders and airspace, showing that personal connections can thrive despite governmental friction.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing tools that make large-scale chromosome engineering easier and more efficient. The new systems, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), can precisely edit large DNA fragments, handling thousands to millions of base pairs in higher organisms like plants. Published in the journal Cell, this breakthrough is expected to accelerate crop improvement and the development of treatments for genetic diseases. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the technology also has promising applications in synthetic biology and could speed up the creation of artificial chromosomes.</p>

          <p>Young people in Shanghai are redefining the city's nightlife, with a growing passion for live theatre performances driving consumption and social activity. This trend is a key part of the city's "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to stimulate domestic demand and offset economic pressures. For many Gen Z residents, nights are spent in theatres, socializing and collecting show-related merchandise, contributing significantly to the local economy. The government is supporting this by simplifying the approval process for nighttime events and enriching cultural offerings, recognizing the night economy as a powerful engine for growth.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace negotiations must include Ukraine. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and others stressed that Kyiv must have a say in its own destiny and that international borders should not be changed by force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has strongly rejected any deals made without his country's participation, calling them "dead decisions." The diplomatic push from Europe underscores concerns that a bilateral U.S.-Russia agreement could undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and European security.</p>

          <p>Liverpool forward and Egyptian star Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned European football's governing body, UEFA, over its tribute to deceased Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid. In a post on X, UEFA mourned al-Obeid, known as the "Palestinian Pelé," but did not mention how he died. Salah replied to the post asking, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?" According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza.

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that robotics could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next two to three years. He defines this moment as the first time a robot can autonomously perform a novel task, like cleaning a room, in an environment it has never seen before. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang stated that while hardware is advancing, the crucial element of "AI for embodied intelligence" is still lacking. He expressed some doubt about current models but suggested that new approaches, like generating interactive video models from text prompts for robots to follow, show promise.</p>

          <p>A small, round piece of a bathroom door lock found under the body of nurse Alexandra Pennig was the critical clue that led investigators to charge Matthew Ecker with her murder. Ecker, Pennig's colleague, initially claimed she had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide. He told police he broke the door down after hearing the gunshot. However, detectives concluded the metal lock piece's location meant the door was forced open *before* the shot was fired, suggesting Ecker broke in and then killed her. This key piece of forensic evidence contradicted Ecker's entire narrative, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are pleading with thousands of residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to stop all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, amid a multi-day service outage. A broken valve disrupted service to 9,200 households during a heatwave, and a boil water advisory remains in effect. Although some water flow has been restored, the Department of Water and Power warned that continued consumption is depleting pressure in a major water tank, delaying the complex, 20-foot-deep repairs. The situation was complicated when a temporary pipe intended to help restore the system burst, though officials believe it will only cause a delay of hours, not days.</p>

This turmoil, combined with significant delays in the reconstruction of the Nou Camp stadium, means Rashford's debut will be at the small training ground stadium.
