          <p>The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has issued an advisory against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories due to the recent escalation in military activity with Iran. This advisory means that travel insurance could be invalidated for individuals who disregard the warning. The FCDO cited the potential for the situation to deteriorate rapidly and without warning as the reason for the updated guidance, following missile launches by both countries and the closure of Israeli airspace. British citizens currently in Israel are urged to exercise caution and monitor updates from the UK government.</p>

          <p>Dr. David A. Kessler, former FDA Commissioner, shares his experience and advice on using GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro for weight loss, detailing his own 60-pound weight loss journey.

Kessler also highlights the role of the food environment in driving weight gain and the risks associated with visceral fat. He suggests focusing on protein and fiber intake, staying hydrated, and being aware of the risks of malnutrition and compounded versions of the drugs. </p>

          <p>A Senate Republican proposal to overhaul student loan repayment could trigger a surge in defaults, according to an expert. The Senate GOP reconciliation bill's higher education provisions would make student debt harder to repay, potentially unleashing an avalanche of student loan defaults. Consumer advocates are concerned that the new terms would imperil many borrowers' ability to meet their monthly bills and get out of debt. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and outstanding federal education debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article describes Israel's multi-layered air defense system, including Iron Dome for short-range rockets, David's Sling for medium-range missiles, and the Arrow system for long-range threats. Iron Dome, in use since 2011, uses radar to detect and intercept projectiles headed toward populated areas. Israel is also developing Iron Beam, a laser defense system intended to destroy small missiles, drones, and mortar shells at a lower cost per shot. The deployment of Iron Beam was originally intended for October 2025, though Israel's military confirmed in late May that it had deployed a laser defense system in combat for the first time.</p>

The tribe will invest its own money and seek additional partners to conserve natural habitat, working collaboratively to shape the future of development in Florida.

          <p>Support for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has risen to 37% due to support for revising the government's rice production policy. A Kyodo News survey showed that 88.5% of respondents support revising the farming policy to boost rice production amid record-high prices and shortages. While 56.9% see the government's response to rising rice prices as insufficient, 36.6% said it was sufficient. The support increase comes ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>
