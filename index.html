          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other diseases. The novel approach produces anti-cancer cells directly within the human body, significantly reducing the high costs associated with conventional methods, which can exceed US$139,200 per treatment. This breakthrough, published in The Lancet, was successfully used to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, offering hope for wider access to this advanced immunotherapy.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning due to impending thunderstorms and torrential rain expected to cause dangerous flash flooding. The Met Office forecasts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to a high risk of property damage, transport disruptions, and power outages. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb the heavy rainfall, exacerbating the flood risk.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in Pakistan as the government warns the sons of former Prime Minister Imran Khan against participating in upcoming nationwide protests for his release.

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil renowned for his record-breaking 2012 parachute jump from the stratosphere, has died at the age of 56 in a paragliding accident in Italy. Witnesses reported seeing his paraglider spin out of control before crashing near a swimming pool in Porto Sant Elpidio, where he was on vacation. Baumgartner became a global icon after becoming the first person to break the sound barrier in free fall during his Red Bull-sponsored jump from nearly 24 miles above Earth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The statement comes amid ongoing negotiations, which reportedly include the return of these hostages in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. This development follows a recent visit by Israel's Mossad chief to Washington to discuss the potential relocation of Palestinians remaining in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill allows banks and other financial institutions to issue stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, a move hailed by the administration as a way to strengthen the dollar and upgrade the financial system. The legislation is seen as a significant victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear regulations to bring digital currencies into the mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its regulations for a future dominated by tokenization. The rise of stablecoins presents significant challenges, particularly for anti-money-laundering efforts and customer verification, due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This call for new rules comes as the market for digital currencies expands rapidly, fueled by the Trump administration's supportive stance and growing investor interest, prompting regulators worldwide to increase their scrutiny.

He attributed the increased need for community arrests to the proliferation of "sanctuary" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE.</p>
