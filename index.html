          <p>A stowaway was tragically discovered deceased inside the landing gear compartment of an American Airlines flight that had recently arrived in Charlotte, North Carolina, from Europe. Maintenance staff made the grim discovery, prompting an investigation by local police, homicide detectives, and the medical examiner's office. While the individual's identity and the flight's European origin are yet unknown, such incidents are rare but almost always fatal due to the extreme freezing temperatures, severe wind chill, and critical lack of oxygen at high altitudes. This tragic event underscores the immense and often insurmountable dangers associated with attempting to travel as a stowaway, with experts consistently highlighting the highly unlikely chance of survival in these perilous conditions.</p>

          <p>A gunman attacked the American Fish Company, an open-air dock-front bar in Southport, North Carolina, from his boat, killing three people and wounding five others. Nigel Edge was arrested shortly after fleeing the scene, facing first-degree murder charges in what police describe as a premeditated attack. One victim remains in critical condition, and many of those affected were vacationers, highlighting the random nature of the tragedy. This incident marks another mass shooting in the U.S. this year, prompting widespread condolences and an indefinite closure of the venue as authorities investigate the motive of the assailant.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has taken a strong lead in parliamentary elections crucial for the country's EU future. With 85% of votes counted, PAS holds 46.4%, while the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc is at 26.7%. Sandu had warned of "massive Russian interference," and bomb scares were reported at polling stations, which her party blamed on Moscow-backed groups. The election highlights Moldova's struggle with Russian influence, economic challenges, and corruption, as citizens vote for either a European future or a pro-Russian past.</p>

          <p>A shooting and arson incident at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulted in two fatalities and ten injuries. The gunman, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, rammed a vehicle into the church and opened fire before being killed in a gunfight with police. The church was deliberately set on fire, leading to a five-alarm blaze and partial collapse. Officials are investigating the motive, with President Trump and other leaders condemning the violence and highlighting concerns about targeted attacks on religious institutions. The FBI has deployed over 100 agents to assist with the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Shaun Murphy defeated Anthony McGill 10-7 in a thrilling final to claim his first British Open snooker title. The 2005 world champion delivered eight breaks of 50-plus, overcoming a strong challenge from Scotland's McGill, who was playing in his first final in eight years. Murphy didn't take the lead until the evening session and, despite McGill's resilience in briefly regaining it, won four consecutive frames to secure his first ranking title in over two years. This victory marks a significant achievement for Murphy, earning him £100,000 in prize money, while McGill collected £45,000.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following President Trump's directive to deploy 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland for 60 days to protect federal property. Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues that Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard, emphasizing that local officials can manage public safety without federal interference. Governor Tina Kotek also pushed back, stating Portland is "a far cry from the war-ravaged community" Trump described, and that military service members should be dedicated to real emergencies. This legal challenge highlights a significant federal-state dispute over authority and the use of military forces domestically.</p>

The forum, featuring candidates like Katie Porter and Xavier Becerra, saw them largely differentiate themselves on the margins, with a focus on their immigrant backgrounds and appeals to Latino voters. Notable divergences emerged on criminal justice reform, specifically Proposition 36, and support for a single-payer healthcare system.

While acknowledging current AI applications might seem limited, Cramer believes in its future potential, citing high demand for AI services and the strategic necessity for major tech companies to invest. He dismisses bubble comparisons by highlighting the current industry's strong financial backing and the genuine utility of AI as a necessity rather than a speculative gamble.

Participants who refuse placements without reasonable excuse will face benefits sanctions, reinforcing a society founded on "contribution." The scheme, funded from existing budgets, will collaborate with private companies to help young people gain skills for full-time employment, addressing the nearly one million 16-24 year olds currently not in education, employment, or training.</p>

          <p>Public opinion is sharply divided regarding Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's potential 2028 presidential run, with discussions highlighting both enthusiasm and significant concerns. Supporters praise her charisma, intelligence, and ability to draw crowds, viewing her as a "winner" for the Democratic party against "corporate clown" politicians. However, critics express doubts about her electability, citing potential obstacles like misogyny, perceived extremism by swing voters, and her progressive stance potentially alienating moderate Democrats. Many suggest a Senate run in 2028 might be a more strategic initial step, allowing her to build experience while remaining in Congress.</p>

          <p>In an interview on "Face the Nation," Robert Costa reported President Trump believes a government shutdown is likely due to a stalemate over healthcare subsidies and immigration, with Trump welcoming the prospect to wield executive power for mass firings. Costa also revealed that Trump's inner circle is discussing potential prosecutions for figures who have scrutinized or criticized the president, including Senator Adam Schiff, New York AG Letitia James, and retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley. This reflects a deepening political divide, with Republicans viewing it as accountability and Democrats alarmed by what they see as authoritarian government at work.</p>

          <p>Denmark has reported new drone sightings at several military locations, prompting the defense ministry to deploy capacities and a nationwide ban on civilian drone flights ahead of an EU Summit. This follows previous incidents raising security concerns in northern Europe amidst suspected Russian aggression. NATO has responded by enhancing vigilance in the Baltic Sea region with new multi-domain assets, including the deployment of a German air defense frigate to Copenhagen. Belarusian President Lukashenko and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov issued warnings against NATO intervention, adding to the geopolitical tensions surrounding these unexplained drone activities.</p>

          <p>Northern India, particularly the Delhi metropolitan region, is experiencing a significant surge in H3N2 influenza infections, with nearly 70% of households in the area reporting flu-like symptoms. Doctors confirm H3N2 as the predominant variant, noting it often presents more severely and lasts longer than common flu, with some patients requiring hospitalization. High-risk groups, including children and the elderly, are most vulnerable to complications like pneumonia. Health officials recommend frequent hand-washing, masking, avoiding crowds, and vaccination, while closely monitoring the virus for potential mutations that could increase transmissibility or evade existing immunity.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated a government shutdown is likely due to an impasse with Democrats, expressing confidence the public will side with him over their demands for Affordable Care Act subsidies. He insists any healthcare negotiations must address immigration and border issues, which Democrats forcefully push back against, citing existing laws prohibiting undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid. Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders, having previously canceled a meeting over "unserious" demands. The White House has also prepared for potential mass federal layoffs if a deal is not reached, signaling Trump's willingness to use executive power and welcome a shutdown.</p>

He criticized the appointment of a personal lawyer with no prosecutorial experience to pursue the case, following the firing of a federal prosecutor who declined charges.

Pundits acknowledge the win as a relief but suggest it merely "paper[s] over the cracks," given the team's poor start to the season. Martin acknowledged the fan sentiment, stating he quickly left the pitch to allow players to celebrate, as the "tanker" of fan opinion shows only tentative signs of turning.</p>

While an unlikely scenario due to Imelda's weaker status, the possibility highlights the complex dynamics of hurricane season. Both storms pose threats, with Humberto bringing life-threatening surf and Imelda expected to dump heavy rains on the U.S. Southeast.</p>
