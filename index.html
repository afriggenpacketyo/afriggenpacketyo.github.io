          <p>Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations allegedly connected to its nuclear program, prompting Defense Minister Israel Katz to declare a state of emergency and warn of potential missile and drone attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would persist until the threat is eliminated, while Iranian state media reported casualties in Tehran. Oil prices surged, and U.S. stock futures declined amid fears of a broader regional conflict. The U.S. affirmed its non-involvement in the strikes, emphasizing the protection of American forces, though President Trump had been briefed beforehand, with Israel stating the action was necessary for self-defense. Optimism around reaching a deal with Iran has diminished and Steve Witkoff's planned talks in Oman are now uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard during protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, deeming the move "illegal." The judge ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, citing a failure to follow congressionally mandated procedures and violations of the Tenth Amendment. The order, which does not limit Trump's use of the Marines, was temporarily stayed pending appeal. The judge emphasized protesters' First Amendment rights and found that the protests did not constitute a "rebellion" justifying federal deployment, with California leaders arguing Trump inflamed tensions unnecessarily, depriving the state of National Guard resources for other critical functions. The judge said the protests in Los Angeles "fall far short" of the legal requirements of a "rebellion" to justify a federal deployment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the activation was unlawful. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The judge rejected the administration's argument that courts lack authority to review the president's decision, citing the need for constitutional government. Trump had deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles over Newsom's objections, claiming there was a rebellion against the government, which Newsom refuted, calling the military deployment unlawful.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs may have been domesticated in southern China as early as the Neolithic period, around 8,000 years ago. Archaeologists analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding that pigs were consuming humans' cooked food and waste. This indicates that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy for the blood cancer myeloma, where toxic drugs are sneaked inside cancer cells. This therapy, called belantamab mafodotin, has shown to halt myeloma for nearly three times longer than current therapies, while reducing side effects. The drug is an advanced form of chemotherapy that hits cancer with a bigger dose. Clinical trials last year showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies.</p>

          <p>Caravan buyers are reporting instances of being misled, ripped off, and even threatened by holiday parks. Allegations include misleading claims about potential rental income, steep increases in site fees without warning, and pressure to sell caravans back to parks at a loss. Some buyers have felt "bullied" by holiday parks, with one couple receiving a veiled threat after seeking legal advice. The holiday park sector is described as "essentially an unregulated sector," with many buyers facing problems due to unfavorable contract terms.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as health secretary, has dismissed the expert committee advising the CDC on vaccine recommendations and appointed individuals with known skepticism towards vaccines, particularly COVID shots. These appointees have spoken out against COVID vaccines, claimed vaccine injuries, and falsely linked COVID shots to deaths. This move undermines the scientific consensus on vaccination and erodes trust in immunization. Kennedy has appointed Robert Malone, Vicky Pebsworth, and Retsef Levi to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, all of whom have publicly advocated for limiting vaccine use.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi has launched a push to lower rice prices, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move aims to alleviate rising household burdens and has returned Koizumi to the political spotlight. Analysts suggest his strong media presence and reformist approach could benefit the LDP in the upcoming national election. Koizumi's actions include releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices and drawing attention to controversial issues in the agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The re-renaming is seen as an insult to those whose names were added and then removed. The move is part of Trump's campaign against what he construes as woke initiatives.</p>
