            <p>A helicopter operated by New York Helicopters crashed into the Hudson River, killing all six people on board, including a family of five from Spain and an American pilot. The helicopter took off from the Downtown Skyport in Manhattan and flew towards the Statue of Liberty before circling back and plunging into the river near Hoboken, New Jersey. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation, with authorities working to determine the factors that led to the tragic incident. Police boats assisted in the rescue efforts but were unsuccessful in saving the victims.</p>

            <p>China has announced it is raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, escalating the trade war between the two countries. The Chinese commerce ministry stated that the U.S.'s imposition of high tariffs violates international trade rules and disregards the global economic order. The statement called rising U.S. tariffs "a joke" and said it would not respond to future U.S. tariff hikes, but threatened retaliation if the U.S. continues to infringe on China's interests. This move follows President Trump's universal tariffs on China, which now total 145%. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated that there is no winner in a tariff war and that going against the world will only result in self-isolation.

            <p>Two American women were arrested at a California immigration checkpoint for allegedly attempting to smuggle two Mexican children into the United States. Border Patrol agents discovered discrepancies in the driver's story and found that the children's IDs did not match their identities. The girls were identified as unaccompanied minors from Mexico, and authorities believe this incident is indicative of child trafficking.

            <p>Danish shoppers are boycotting U.S. products in protest of President Trump's posturing over Greenland and trade tariffs. Salling Group, a major grocery chain, has labeled European-owned brands to make it easier for shoppers to avoid American goods. This boycott reflects a wider sentiment of anti-Americanism in Europe, with some travelers also avoiding trips to the U.S. due to Trump's policies and currency fluctuations. Some analysts suggest these protests may be short-lived as consumers ultimately seek the best deals.</p>

Despite Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas's promise to look into her case, Betty feels justice is still being denied after waiting 26 years.

            <p>The Trump administration is invoking the McCarran-Walter Act, or the Immigration Nationality Act of 1952, to deport immigrant student protesters, raising concerns about free speech rights. This controversial law, originally designed to detain and deport communists during the Cold War, allows the U.S. government to deport non-citizens whose activities are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences. Critics argue this sets a dangerous precedent that could be used against American citizens with dissenting opinions. A decision about Mahmoud Khalil's case, a Columbia University graduate student facing deportation, is expected soon.</p>

The lightning's power cleanses the trees of parasitic vines and reduces competition by zapping nearby trees. Dipteryx oleifera, a tree in Panama's forests, is particularly adept at thriving after enduring these events. Researchers believe that the tree's electrical conductivity may contribute to its ability to withstand the immense current.</p>

The RSPB encourages people to take small actions in their gardens to support starlings and other wildlife, such as avoiding pesticides and providing nest boxes. The survey, involving almost 600,000 people, also revealed that house sparrows remain the most numerous species recorded.</p>
