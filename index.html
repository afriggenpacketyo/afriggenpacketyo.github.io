          <p>New data reveals that UK government borrowing in April was higher than expected, leading experts to believe that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may need to raise taxes in the autumn. The borrowing figures reached Â£20.2 billion, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. Analysts suggest that weaker economic growth could negatively impact tax receipts, further straining government finances. This BBC article highlights the economic challenges faced by the UK government and the potential implications for taxpayers, as well as the government's claim that they have taken decisions to stabilize public finances. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated a previous court order by deporting eight men convicted of violent crimes to South Sudan without due process. The judge did not order the return of the deportees but required the government to conduct interviews to determine if they have a credible fear of being deported to South Sudan, providing access to lawyers and interpreters. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling as "deranged", while lawyers for the deported men expressed concerns about access to counsel and the safety of South Sudan.

          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa's attempt to reset relations with President Trump backfired during a meeting in the Oval Office, as Trump focused on false accusations of white genocide. Trump played video clips of a South African politician calling for violence against Afrikaners, and dismissed Ramaphosa's efforts to address the footage. Despite Ramaphosa's efforts to secure trade reassurances, the meeting highlighted the strained relationship between the two countries.
