          <p>President Donald Trump announced that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from conducting business with the United States. This action is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign to halt Iran's oil exports and aims to cut off revenue used to finance militant groups. The announcement has already impacted oil prices, with U.S. crude and Brent crude both rising following the statement.</p>
