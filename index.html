          <p>Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier has been arrested and charged with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy in a federal case. Prosecutors allege he was part of a group that used nonpublic information about NBA player injuries to place illegal bets, gaining an unfair advantage. The U.S. Attorney's office described the case as a "wide-sweeping criminal enterprise" involving organized crime. Rozier's attorney criticized the arrest as a publicity stunt, stating his client had previously cooperated with authorities and was cleared by the NBA in an earlier review of the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers. Despite the increase in sales, housing inventory remains historically lean, which continues to put upward pressure on prices. The median home price rose 2.1% year-over-year to $415,200, marking the 27th consecutive month of annual gains and keeping prices significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.

          <p>The Environment Agency has given England's water and sewerage companies their lowest-ever collective score for environmental performance in 2024. The report revealed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents compared to the previous year, with eight out of nine companies rated as "requiring improvement" or worse. Thames Water received the lowest possible one-star rating amid significant financial troubles. Industry officials acknowledged the poor performance, citing factors like wet weather and underinvestment, while environmental groups called for a complete overhaul of the privatized water system to protect the nation's rivers.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity experts are urging Android users to delete a fraudulent app named "Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN" that masquerades as a legitimate streaming and VPN service. Once installed, the app deploys a sophisticated malware strain called Klopatra, which can grant attackers full remote access to the device. This allows criminals to steal sensitive information, including banking credentials, and carry out fraudulent transactions without the user's knowledge. The threat highlights the growing danger of downloading apps from unofficial sources and the importance of using reputable security software to protect personal data.</p>

          <p>A former British paratrooper, known only as Soldier F, has been found not guilty of murder and attempted murder for his role in the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Londonderry. The judge at Belfast Crown Court stated that while members of the Parachute Regiment shot unarmed civilians, the evidence against Soldier F specifically fell short of the standard required for a conviction. The verdict was met with disappointment from the families of the victims, who were shot during a civil rights demonstration. The trial has reignited painful memories and debates surrounding justice for events during the Troubles.</p>

          <p>The San Francisco Bay Area is bracing for a significant federal immigration enforcement operation, with reports of over 100 Customs and Border Protection agents staged in the region. This follows President Trump's recent statements signaling a potential crackdown, citing the need to combat crime. California's state and local leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have strongly condemned the move as a political tactic designed to instill fear and have vowed immediate legal challenges against any such deployment. Community groups are mobilizing to support immigrant communities and prepare for potential disruptions.</p>

          <p>The British government has refused to allocate parliamentary time for a debate on Prince Andrew's titles and his taxpayer-funded residence, effectively halting legislative efforts to strip him of his dukedom. The decision comes amid renewed scrutiny of the prince's affairs following the publication of Virginia Giuffre's memoir, which detailed allegations related to his association with Jeffrey Epstein. While Prince Andrew has agreed to no longer use his royal titles, only an act of Parliament can formally remove them. Downing Street stated that the Royal Family would not want to detract from other important government business.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic posits that despite the reputation of college campuses as liberal strongholds, political energy and intellectual curiosity are increasingly found on the right. The author, a recent Stanford graduate who became a conservative during college, argues that a campus culture perceived as stifling debate and enforcing progressive orthodoxy is driving students toward conservative groups. These spaces are described as offering a vibrant forum for diverse right-leaning viewpoints and robust discussion, which is attracting students weary of a perceived lack of open discourse. This trend is reflected in growing membership in conservative campus organizations.</p>

This contrasts with another group of four survivors who recently quit the inquiry's panel, demanding Phillips' resignation to restore their trust. The disagreement centers on whether the inquiry's scope should be expanded and on the minister's handling of the process.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are monitoring a severe marine heatwave, known as a "blob," in the north-western Pacific Ocean, with August temperatures reaching 2.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This significant ocean warming could lead to increased thunderstorms and disrupt marine ecosystems, forcing species to migrate or causing die-offs. Researchers suggest the phenomenon may also influence weather patterns in North America, potentially increasing flood risks in the Pacific Northwest and contributing to colder, snowier winter conditions in eastern regions. These heatwaves have become more frequent and intense over the past decade, highlighting ongoing changes in the climate system.</p>

Before 1980, agencies often continued operations during funding gaps, but legal opinions from that era established that they lacked the authority to do so. President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns, while the longest in history was a 35-day partial shutdown in 2018-2019 under President Trump. These events, often stemming from intense partisan standoffs over budget priorities, have become more frequent in the last decade, causing significant economic disruption and furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, financial experts are offering guidance on how much cash to allocate to these accounts. Planners suggest that dedicating 10% to 30% of savings to CDs can be a prudent strategy to earn higher yields than a standard savings account while maintaining liquidity. The decision depends on individual financial goals, emergency fund status, and risk tolerance, as CD funds are locked for a set term. Given that the Federal Reserve may lower rates further, now could be an opportune time to lock in current yields. (not investment advice)</p>

The complaint also includes accusations from priests that he plagiarized sermons and bullied staff members. Wood has denied the allegations, stating he believes they have no merit and will trust the church's canonical process.

The selection process is depicted as chaotic, with inexperience being no obstacle to securing a high-level position.

Previously, the administration had favored direct engagement over punitive measures. This shift from a "carrot" to a "stick" approach comes after it became clear that a new summit was unlikely to produce a breakthrough, as Russia remains determined to achieve its military objectives in the Donbas region.</p>

Instead of rules for chatbots, policy has focused on the technology's building blocks, such as advanced semiconductor chips, which both the Biden and Trump administrations have controlled through export restrictions and strategic investments. This approach prioritizes national security and maintaining a military advantage over addressing societal harms like discrimination or surveillance. The author contends that this strategy redefines regulation, creating a light touch at the surface but an iron grip at the core of AI development.</p>
