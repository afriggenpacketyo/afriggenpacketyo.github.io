          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a warning about the "rising" and unpredictable national security threat posed by Iran. The report highlights a significant increase in physical threats, including assassination and kidnapping plots against dissidents on British soil, with at least 15 such attempts since early 2022. The committee criticizes the government for focusing too much on crisis management and urges a more resourced, long-term strategy to counter Iran's wide-ranging hostile activities. The threat is now considered comparable to that posed by Russia.</p>

          <p>Australian police are appealing for public assistance in the search for a 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, who has been missing for over a week. She was last seen in the small town of Beacon, and her van was later found with apparent mechanical issues in a remote area northeast of Perth. Authorities have stated her disappearance is concerning and unexplained, with her phone being switched off. A broad search operation is underway, and while no third-party involvement is confirmed, all possibilities are being investigated.</p>

          <p>Detectives are investigating new historical sexual abuse allegations against a recently convicted former Church in Wales bishop, Anthony Pierce, and another former vicar. A BBC investigation reveals that concerns about Pierce were reported to church officials as early as 1986, years before his promotion, but were allegedly ignored. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, citing a culture of concealment and failure to act on serious complaints, including one case where Pierce himself allegedly failed to address an assault claim against a choirmaster. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, has resulted in the deaths of at least 15 Palestinians, among them eight children and two women. According to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, the victims were waiting in line for nutritional supplements near a medical facility when the strike occurred. This incident takes place amidst ongoing, but difficult, ceasefire and hostage-release negotiations in Doha, with both Hamas and Israeli officials indicating that a final agreement could still be weeks away. The overall death toll in Gaza has now surpassed 57,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

          <p>The European Union is intensifying its "de-risking" strategy from China by developing plans to regain control over key industrial sectors and reduce dependencies on Chinese supply chains. These efforts include measures like stockpiling, implementing stricter trade defenses, and diversifying supply sources for critical materials where China holds a near-monopoly. The initiative is part of a broader EU agenda that views economic resilience and industrial policy as essential tools for geopolitical alignment. This reflects a growing acknowledgment of the challenges posed by China's economic dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite public praise from President Trump, morale within the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is reportedly at a low point. Current and former employees describe a workforce feeling vilified by the public and pressured by the administration to meet high deportation quotas, shifting focus from major criminal investigations to civil immigration arrests. Agents express frustration over long hours, deteriorating infrastructure, and a mission they feel is now driven by political numbers rather than public safety.

The situation for at-risk communities is now even more challenging, as the Trump administration has frozen or canceled billions in federal disaster preparedness funding, shifting the financial burden to states.

Instead, it will pursue reforms to the existing national pricing system.

          <p>Owen Farrell has been selected as a replacement for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming match against an Australia/New Zealand Invitational XV. This will be the final tour game before the highly anticipated Test series against Australia begins. The selection marks a potential return to high-level rugby for Farrell, who recently joined the tour as an injury replacement and has not played in over two months. The match also provides a key opportunity for other players, such as scrum-half Ben White and full-back Hugo Keenan, to make their case for a spot in the Test squad.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea, the Greek-operated Eternity C, just days after sinking another vessel. The attack, carried out with rocket-propelled grenades from small boats, resulted in at least three deaths, with ten crew members rescued and others still missing. The Iran-backed group claimed it targeted the ship for heading to Israel and stated it had taken some surviving crew to a safe location. The incident marks a significant escalation in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping, which the group claims are in support of Palestinians.</p>

          <p>The European Union is confronting a significant dilemma in its trade negotiations with the Trump administration, facing a choice between accepting a potentially flawed deal or holding out for better terms. Washington has floated an offer with a baseline 10% tariff but has not guaranteed exemptions for key European industries like automobiles and steel. While the EU's chief negotiator has framed the ongoing talks as a success for having so far avoided steeper tariffs, some lawmakers warn against accepting a one-sided "diktat" from the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, has called for careful ethical and legal consideration regarding the use of humanoid robots in combat. The analysis warned against falling into "moral pitfalls" and cited science fiction author Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. The authors argued that militarized humanoid robots would inherently violate the first law, which prohibits a robot from injuring a human being. The piece underscores growing global concerns about the ethical implications of autonomous weapons systems.</p>

One survivor recounted hearing a deafening, explosion-like sound as a section of the 40-year-old bridge over the Mahisagar river gave way, plunging vehicles into the water below. Dramatic visuals showed a truck teetering on the broken edge, while others were completely submerged. An investigation into the cause of the collapse is underway as rescue teams continue to search for at least four people who are still missing.</p>

          <p>The UK and France are reportedly close to a new agreement aimed at tackling illegal migration across the English Channel. The deal would involve France taking back a certain number of migrants who have crossed, in exchange for the UK accepting a similar number of asylum seekers with legitimate claims from France. However, the ultimate test of the policy's success will be whether it acts as a significant deterrent and leads to a noticeable reduction in the number of small boat crossings. Critics argue the initial pilot scheme may be too small to have a meaningful impact.</p>

          <p>The European Union is growing increasingly concerned about China's dominance over the global supply of rare earth minerals, viewing it as a strategic vulnerability. European policymakers see China's potential to curb exports of these critical materials as a form of "strategic chokehold" that is more threatening than US tariffs. While the EU is pursuing strategies to diversify its supply chains and increase recycling capacity, analysts believe Europe will remain heavily dependent on Chinese rare earths for at least the next decade. This dependency complicates the EU's position in global trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>
