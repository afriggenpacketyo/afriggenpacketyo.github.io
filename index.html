            <p>American grandparents, particularly grandmothers, are increasingly becoming co-parents due to economic, cultural, and workplace shifts that have left parents struggling.

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are expected to negatively impact low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods and increasing the risk of a recession. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, disproportionately burdening lower-income households who spend a larger percentage of their income on essential goods. While some argue that tariffs benefit small businesses, economists warn of potential stagflation and job losses that would disproportionately harm the poor. Potential solutions include congressional action or court challenges, but the most immediate change would require Trump to reverse his policies.</p>

The government is seeking a buyer for British Steel and will not sell it to another Chinese company.

            <p>South Florida's condo market is experiencing a downturn as prices fall and listings surge due to increased ownership costs and regulatory changes. Condo owners are struggling to sell their units, with many forced to lower prices. Increased maintenance fees and special assessments have made condo ownership unaffordable for some, leading to an oversupply of inventory. Experts advise buyers to be educated about the market conditions before making a purchase. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The US has quietly exempted smartphones, including iPhones, from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China. This move reverses the previous announcement that tariffs would bring iPhone production back to the US. The exemption avoids a significant price increase for iPhones in American stores and a potential global repricing. Apple CEO Tim Cook may play a key role in brokering peace in the US-China trade war, given his expertise in supply chain logistics and his relationships with both presidents.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, which benefited from the first U.S.-China trade war, now faces uncertainty due to President Trump's latest tariffs, including a 46% tax on imports from Vietnam. Despite a temporary stay on the new duties, the potential impact on Vietnamese manufacturing and exports is significant. The country is exploring strategies to mitigate the effects, including lowering corporate tax rates and attracting foreign investment. Some analysts believe Vietnam could still emerge as a winner if it can navigate the chaotic trade landscape.</p>

            <p>The author draws parallels between characters in Homer's 'Iliad' and Donald Trump, ultimately arguing that Trump most closely resembles King Agamemnon. Agamemnon, like Trump, is portrayed as a brute who relies on intimidation, boasts when he wins, rants when he loses, and is immune to shame. The author contends that Agamemnon's leadership style, characterized by self-interest and disregard for others, mirrors Trump's approach to politics and governance.</p>
