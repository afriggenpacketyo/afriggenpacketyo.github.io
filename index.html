          <p>President Trump cut his G7 trip short due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, specifically the conflict between Israel and Iran, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump, who had met with leaders from Canada and the United Kingdom, returned to Washington to address "important matters." The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, though it has assisted in intercepting Iranian missiles, with Trump urging Iran to negotiate a deal to limit its nuclear program. He also warned against striking U.S. military bases in the region, emphasizing the need for immediate talks before it's too late. The article notes that the US had previously rejected a plan by Netanyahu to kill Iran's Supreme Leader. </p>

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, where discussions centered on international conflict and trade agreements. During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump showcased a recently signed trade agreement, although he initially misspoke, attributing it to the European Union. The agreement included details on steel and aluminum quotas, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining the amount of products eligible for tariff exemptions. Trump also praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister, highlighting the importance of the trade deal for job creation and income generation.</p>

          <p>Following a shooting in Minnesota that targeted Democratic lawmakers, members of Congress are advocating for enhanced security measures. The suspected shooter had a "hit list" of 45 elected Democrats, prompting concerns and reassessments of security protocols.

There has been a broader increase in threats to lawmakers in recent years, with the Capitol Police reporting a surge in such incidents, leading to calls for more resources for personal security. </p>

          <p>A coalition of press rights organizations is suing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) over alleged excessive force against journalists covering protests related to President Trump’s immigration policies. The lawsuit cites instances of officers using foam projectiles, tear gas, and detaining journalists without cause, violating state laws protecting media coverage of unrest. The suit aims to prevent the LAPD from obstructing journalists and calls for respect of constitutional rights. The LAPD has announced an internal review of a recent incident involving a protester injured during a confrontation with officers, but has not commented on the pending litigation.</p>

Several cities relied on BRIC funds for flood mitigation projects, such as constructing stormwater storage facilities and elevating commercial properties. The cancellation of the BRIC program has left these communities scrambling for alternative funding sources, jeopardizing their ability to complete critical infrastructure projects. Despite FEMA's promise to coordinate with affected applicants, some cities have not received any communication from the agency regarding the status of their projects.</p>

          <p>President Trump advocated for the readmission of Russia to the former G8, stating that its removal after the 2014 Crimean invasion was a mistake. This statement occurred before Trump was scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the G7 summit. However, the meeting was cancelled due to Trump's early departure from the summit, which the White House attributed to developments in the Middle East. The key stories at a glance involve Trump's stance on Russia and his abrupt exit from the summit.</p>

Arias's translation was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to strengthen ties with Latin American countries during World War II, and was considered the only official translation of the anthem. Nezza emphasizes that the song symbolizes American pride and the significant role of Latinos in building the nation.</p>

The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while increasing the Child Tax Credit to $2,200, and calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Circle's stock price experienced a significant surge after CEO Jeremy Allaire suggested that stablecoins are approaching their "iPhone moment." Allaire argued that stablecoins have yet to reach their full potential but could soon become ubiquitous in various applications. The stock jumped as much as 22% to over $168 in early trading Monday, which is more than five times its $31 IPO price. The company is positioning itself to lead the charge in making stablecoins more accessible and integrated into everyday transactions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are competing to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada for the first time since 1993, aiming to break a 30-year drought. Ice hockey is deeply ingrained in Canadian identity, with a significant portion of NHL players being Canadian. The repeated losses have united Canadians against the US, especially amid trade tensions. While the Oilers began the series strong, concerns arise that history could repeat itself, with Game 6 being a do-or-die situation for the team. </p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee unveiled its version of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which could lead to a clash with the House due to key differences. The Senate's proposal includes an extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts, a debt limit increase, and cuts to Medicaid, but differs from the House version on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. House leaders have warned senators to make minimal changes to ensure the bill's passage, while senators have conditioned their support on specific proposals, leading to potential sticking points in negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, with comments veering from support for Israel to distancing himself from the strikes. Trump's options include escalating the conflict by bowing to pressure from Netanyahu, holding the course by maintaining the current level of involvement, or pulling back and listening to Maga voices who reject traditional support for Israel. The political factors playing on Trump's mind include his domestic support and the risks associated with escalation, with different voices within his movement offering conflicting advice.</p>

          <p>A doctor charged with supplying Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the actor's death has agreed to plead guilty to distribution of ketamine. Dr. Salvador Plasencia faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and is expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks. The plea agreement comes after Perry's death was ruled to be primarily caused by ketamine, which the actor had been using as a legal treatment for depression. The doctor allegedly sought to become Perry's "go-to" source for the drug.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration secured a legal victory when a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging cuts to Columbia University's federal funding. The lawsuit, brought by faculty groups, contested the administration's decision to cut $400 million in funding due to alleged antisemitism on campus. The judge ruled that the faculty unions lacked standing to bring the suit and that the administration had not broken the law. The ruling underscores the administration's efforts to reshape American higher education and its stance on antisemitism on college campuses.</p>
