          <p>According to new court filings, Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a doomsday ‚Äúprepper‚Äù who instructed his family to ‚Äúprepare for war‚Äù as he tried to evade capture. Boelter faces multiple federal and state murder charges after allegedly killing Melissa Hortman and her husband and seriously wounding John Hoffman and his wife. His wife told investigators that Boelter had recently sent a message to their children stating they should prepare for war and leave the house because people with guns may be showing up. He was eventually captured after fleeing into a wooded area near his home, and the affidavit does not imply that Boelter‚Äôs wife knew about her husband‚Äôs alleged plans. The tone of this article is based on the reality of how tragic such an event is.</p>

Witnesses described seeing rocks tumbling and a large piece of the mountain falling off, creating a cloud of dust that obscured a group of hikers.

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war began with further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility, as Iran warned against U.S. intervention. Israel's defense minister claimed the military killed three senior Iranian commanders, while Iran launched another wave of drones and missiles at Israel. President Trump is considering U.S. military intervention, facing pressure to find a diplomatic solution, and the conflict continues to escalate alongside Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is considering selling over 16 million acres of federal land in California to address the housing affordability crisis. This proposal, part of President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig, Beautiful Bill,‚Äù aims to increase housing supply, but faces criticism for potentially impacting public lands. While some experts argue that selling federal land could ease the housing shortage, others view it as an ‚Äúun-American‚Äù idea, emphasizing the importance of local input in decisions regarding land acquisition or disposition.
