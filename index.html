        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British pound has reached its highest level in over three years against the U.S. dollar, although analysts are divided on whether it will continue to rise. Much of the pound's recent strength is attributed to dollar weakness rather than specific confidence in sterling, with factors like unpredictable U.S. trade policies shaking confidence in American assets. While some analysts predict further dollar weakening and a rise in the pound, others foresee limited near-term upside due to softer UK economic momentum and potential Bank of England rate cuts. Longer-term catalysts for the pound could include improved relations with the EU, but macroeconomic conditions may not fully support sterling's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, bringing cautious optimism to Israel, though uncertainty remains as Iran threatens to accelerate its nuclear work. While both countries claim victory, initial U.S. intelligence suggests the strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back by months, not decades as claimed by some officials. Iran intends to resume and accelerate its enrichment work without IAEA oversight, prompting lawmakers to fast-track a proposal halting cooperation with the agency. Despite the conflicting information, life in Israel is returning to normal, with hopes that diplomacy could revive talks to end the war in Gaza and bring home Israeli hostages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and housing demand are stuck in a holding pattern, with economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts having little impact on rate movement. Rates have remained in a narrow range around 7% since early April, offering little incentive to potential homebuyers facing high prices and low inventory. Mortgage applications to buy a home decreased slightly, though purchase demand is up from last year, overall demand remains historically low. Applications to refinance a home loan increased, but volumes are so low that even small changes make for big percentage moves.</p>

          <p>This article examines the claim that NATO expansion drove Russia to war in Ukraine, a justification often used by the Kremlin. While Russia views NATO's eastward expansion as a threat, particularly the inclusion of former Soviet states, NATO insists it is a defensive alliance. The article delves into the history of alleged promises made to the Soviet Union regarding NATO expansion during German reunification, analyzing different interpretations of these statements. Ultimately, the article concludes that regardless of historical assurances, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an act of aggression, although the prospect of NATO expansion may have been a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>President Trump is disputing an early Pentagon report that indicated the recent U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set the program back by a few months. Trump insists the strikes caused "total obliteration" and set Iran back "basically decades," while Defense Secretary Hegseth supported the president's position, suggesting the report leak had political motives. Democratic senators are calling for answers and suggest the conflict could have been avoided if Trump hadn't withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, and Trump expressed optimism about future relations with Iran.</p>

          <p>Japanese pop group Tokio, formerly part of Johnny & Associates Inc., has announced its disbandment following a misconduct scandal involving member Taichi Kokubun. The group, known for its support for Fukushima Prefecture after the 2011 nuclear crisis, decided it would be difficult to regain trust and continue receiving support. Kokubun has indefinitely suspended his activities due to breaches involving behavior that could be considered sexual harassment, and the disbandment follows a series of scandals involving former members of Johnny & Associates.</p>

The case involved €400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair argued the aid discriminated against other airlines, but the court found no evidence of this and ruled the Commission acted lawfully, and Ryanair may still appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>Struggling households in England, Scotland, and Wales owe billions in unpaid council tax, with bills expected to rise further. Newly published figures reveal £6.6bn is owed in England, with an additional £642m added in the past year, and total arrears in the three countries exceed £8bn. Campaigners are calling for a more sympathetic approach to debt collection, while the government proposes changes to debt enforcement and assumes council tax will rise by 5% annually. Charities argue the current collection method punishes those genuinely struggling to pay, and the Local Government Association emphasizes the need for adequate government funding to support low-income households.</p>

While celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which legalized same-sex marriage, the community faces increasing challenges, including homophobic rhetoric, restrictions on transgender rights, and corporate pullback from Pride events. This has created a sense of whiplash for Generation Z, who grew up in a relatively gay-friendly social climate but are now witnessing the erosion of their rights, and the current climate is taking a psychological toll, with increased depression and anxiety reported among young queer individuals.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts in a Republican budget bill could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance and thousands of unnecessary deaths each year. The bill would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034. This would reverse recent progress in reducing the uninsured rate, and the loss of coverage would lead to fewer preventive health screenings and between 8,200 and 24,600 additional annual deaths, according to an analysis. Senate Republicans are considering work requirements for Medicaid recipients and limits on state financing tools, which could further exacerbate these negative health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Oneil Cruz of the Pittsburgh Pirates was taken out of a game after he failed to run out a double-play grounder, admitting he lost track of the number of outs. Manager Don Kelly cited a lack of energy and effort as the reason for the removal, and Cruz acknowledged his mistake. This incident follows a recent outfield blunder, and Cruz has been struggling at the plate, but he maintained that his issue on the basepaths had nothing to do with his slump at the plate.</p>
