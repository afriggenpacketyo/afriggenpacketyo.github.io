          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has criticized reported remarks from EU Chief Ursula von der Leyen about "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine, calling public discussion of the topic premature. The article also covers several other developments, including Kyiv's condemnation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for omitting the war from its closing statement and diplomatic engagements by Russia, Turkey, and India. This live blog compilation provides a broad overview of the day's key events related to the conflict and international reactions.</p>

          <p>Several dozen Afghan nationals, including former employees of German institutions and others at risk of persecution, have arrived in Germany after securing visas through legal action. Their arrival comes despite the German government's recent move to pause resettlement plans as part of a tougher stance on immigration. A court recently ruled that the government has the right to stop issuing visas, but the families that arrived successfully acquired them after filing lawsuits. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges for Afghans seeking refuge and the shifting immigration policies within Germany.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reached an agreement with Crystal Palace to sign England center-back Marc Guehi, with the deal expected to be finalized after a medical examination. The transfer fee is a compromise from Liverpool's initial £35 million offer. This signing is part of a significant summer spending spree for the Premier League champions, aimed at strengthening their defense after conceding multiple goals early in the season. The acquisition of Guehi follows several other high-profile signings, pushing the club's total summer expenditure to a record high.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-six earthquake has struck a remote, mountainous region in eastern Afghanistan, resulting in more than 800 fatalities and nearly 3,000 injuries. The death toll is expected to rise as entire villages have been destroyed, and rescue operations are severely hampered by the difficult terrain and damaged infrastructure. The disaster exacerbates an already dire humanitarian situation in the country, which is grappling with drought and the suspension of most foreign aid. Officials describe the scale of the devastation as unimaginable, with many victims still trapped under rubble.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy who survived last week's mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school has a bullet fragment lodged dangerously close to his carotid artery in his neck. The boy, Weston Halsne, was shielded by a friend during the attack that killed two other children and injured many more. Doctors described his survival as a "miracle," and he is scheduled for surgery to remove the fragment with an expectation of a full recovery. The incident highlights the severe physical and emotional trauma inflicted upon the young survivors of the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held prominent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. These friendly exchanges are widely interpreted as a strategic message to Washington following the implementation of heavy U.S. tariffs on Indian goods. While not directly criticizing the U.S., Modi's actions and a statement from Xi condemning "bullying behavior" signal a strengthening of ties among nations challenging U.S. dominance. President Trump reacted on social media, asserting that India has more to lose in an economic dispute.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have initiated the "snapback" mechanism to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA).

Iran has stated it will not alter its position, and some political forces within the country are now advocating for withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

          <p>The UK's 30-year bond yields have risen more than those in the U.S., creating a puzzle for investors and raising concerns about fiscal sustainability. To counter a potential crisis, the article suggests the UK government must take bold, eye-catching measures in its autumn budget to change the market narrative. Recommendations include credible fiscal projections, significant tax reform like a land tax to fund reductions in taxes on labor, and policies with a "wow factor" to boost growth. The Bank of England is also urged to reconsider its policies on quantitative tightening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With CD interest rates having fallen from their recent peaks, savers are looking for the best returns. According to financial professionals, short-term CDs, particularly those with a six-month term, are currently offering the most attractive rates, with some yields still above 4%. While longer-term CDs historically offered higher rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. Experts suggest that savers looking to maximize immediate returns should focus on these short-term options, while those seeking to lock in current rates might consider a CD ladder strategy.

          <p>Amanda Goetz, a two-time startup founder, is promoting a concept she calls "sustainable ambition" as an alternative to "toxic grit" and hustle culture. After experiencing severe burnout that led to hospitalization, she developed a strategy of intentionally scheduling cycles of intense work followed by periods of proactive rest. Goetz argues that ambitious individuals can have it all, but not all at once, and should periodically reevaluate their priorities. Her approach involves accepting that different areas of life require focus at different times, creating a healthier rhythm for long-term success.</p>

The decision follows a disappointing start, including a home defeat and a draw where the team collapsed late against a 10-man opponent. The club's sporting director cited a lack of feasibility in building a successful team as the reason for the abrupt dismissal. The move highlights the immense pressure on the club, which is undergoing a major rebuild after selling several key players from its historic title-winning squad of the previous season.</p>

This behavior, which signals benign intentions, was effective with both familiar and unfamiliar cats. The study provides evidence for what many cat owners have long suspected and offers a simple, practical way for people to enhance their bond with their feline companions.</p>

However, Wimbledon officials consider their traditional mixed doubles event a key part of the tournament's identity and believe doubles competitions are already more appreciated at the Championships.

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the author's visits to Tbilisi, Georgia, amidst the country's pro-democracy protests against a Russia-aligned government. The writer contrasts the profound bravery and persistent resistance of Georgian citizens, who protest despite great personal risk, with a perceived softness and lack of resistance in the United States in the face of its own democratic challenges. The article uses the Georgian struggle for self-determination as a lens to examine the fragility of democratic rights and questions when citizens must decide to take a stand, even when it feels futile or dangerous.</p>
