          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, have pressured Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire with Ukraine, emphasizing the importance of reconnecting Ukraine's economy and reuniting families. The announcement came after discussions with US President Donald Trump, who initially suggested an unconditional ceasefire. Leaders threatened Russia with significant sanctions if it fails to comply. Russia has insisted on halting Western military aid to Ukraine before considering a ceasefire, but Ukraine maintains the ceasefire should be unconditional. The planned truce would be monitored mainly by the US, with European support, and any violation would trigger coordinated sanctions.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the US focused on Mars, the Soviets achieved several milestones with the Venera program, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. The re-entry highlights the legacy of space exploration and the numerous objects still orbiting Earth, sometimes unexpectedly returning to the planet.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, causing homes to shake and waking residents. No major damage or injuries were immediately reported, although the USGS received thousands of reports from the public. The earthquake occurred in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, an area with a history of seismic activity, and there is a small chance of aftershocks. Experts remind residents of the importance of knowing what to do during an earthquake, such as dropping, covering, and holding on, and staying clear of buildings if outside.</p>

He recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed made-for-TV movies, trusting his gut to identify compelling stories. Diller stresses that while data can provide historical context, it often hinders creative and business decisions by narrowing the scope of understanding. He shares anecdotes about greenlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on their inherent appeal rather than extensive research.</p>

          <p>Climate change is significantly altering bird migration patterns, impacting their ability to feed, breed, and maintain ecosystem balance. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, and coastal changes affect migratory birds' routes and food sources. Warmer temperatures can shorten routes or cause birds to abandon their original habitats, leading to conflicts with resident species. While some species adapt by expending more energy, others, like the slender-billed curlew, have become extinct due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts and bird-friendly practices are crucial to support migratory birds and maintain ecological health.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, according to officials from both countries, after rising tensions stemming from an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. President Trump initially announced the ceasefire, attributing it to U.S.-mediated talks, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed U.S. involvement in brokering the agreement. However, Indian officials stated that the ceasefire was worked out directly between the two countries. The agreement follows a period of escalating conflict, with both sides accusing each other of provocations and military movements.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers, a long-standing figure in the diet industry, has filed for bankruptcy after losing over a million members, struggling to compete with social media influencers and the rise of weight loss injections. The company states it is not ceasing operations and that filing for bankruptcy will help resolve its debt. The increasing popularity of medications like Mounjaro, which mimic hormones to suppress appetite, has disrupted traditional weight loss methods. While some experts are concerned about the long-term effects of these injections, others see them as a tool for gaining control over food.</p>
