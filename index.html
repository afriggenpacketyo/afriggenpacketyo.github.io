However, former regulators like Amanda Fischer warn of the high volatility and speculative nature of these assets, comparing the current fervor to the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis and cautioning about significant consumer risks.

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move to Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical with their young son. The primary motivation was to allow their son to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to experience a different culture without work pressures. The experience proved transformative, leading them to re-evaluate their career priorities and realize they could live happily on less, while also providing time for personal growth and welcoming a second child.</p>

These "agentic teammates" are designed to automate routine tasks like monitoring and initial incident response, freeing up human analysts to focus on more complex threats. While experts see this as an essential evolution to counter AI-powered attacks and address the cybersecurity skills gap, there are still questions about the scalability and trustworthiness of these AI systems as they become more autonomous.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a book review of a story set in 18th-century England where five mysterious sisters are accused of witchcraft after being seen transforming into dogs. The article explores how the novel directly engages with the historical subtext of witch stories, where femininity itself is perceived as a threat. While praising the book's lush and violent prose, the review notes that the novel sometimes states its feminist themes too bluntly, though it ultimately succeeds in showing how persecution feels new and startling to each life it touches.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has issued an apology after two blind women were left behind on their original, delayed flight while nearly all other passengers were rebooked onto an earlier plane. The women, unaware of the change because they could not see the gate announcements and were not verbally informed, ended up on a flight to Orlando as the only two passengers. They are calling for the airline to improve its communication protocols for passengers with disabilities to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently signed tax and spending bill is shaping up to be a central issue for both parties heading into the August congressional recess and the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats plan to campaign against the bill's cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which they argue will harm working families while benefiting the wealthy. Republicans are defending the legislation, highlighting tax relief for workers and stricter requirements for welfare programs, believing it will resonate positively with their base and showcase their commitment to campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Miami's historic Freedom Tower, which served as a processing center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s and 70s, is reopening after a major refurbishment. A new exhibition focuses on the personal and often traumatic stories of those who passed through its doors, like Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a child. The restored landmark aims to use technology and first-hand accounts to create an immersive experience, preserving the legacy of the hundreds of thousands of Cubans who began their new lives in the United States within its walls.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new bill offering a tax deduction on tip income has been met with both interest and skepticism from service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on qualified tips, but some workers feel it sounds "too good to be true," and confusion remains about the details. Experts point out that the break is temporary, phases out for higher earners, and does not eliminate state or payroll taxes, with key IRS rules on qualifying gratuities still unclear.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's directive for NASA to place a nuclear reactor on the moon by the end of the decade is framed as an essential step for establishing a permanent human presence there. The article argues that a lunar base, powered by nuclear energy to survive the long, cold lunar nights, is a more achievable and democratic goal than a Mars mission. Furthermore, it's presented as a geopolitical necessity to counter Chinese ambitions for their own nuclear-powered lunar base, potentially preventing a land grab and ensuring a U.S. presence in future space exploration.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of wanting to reduce animal suffering without committing to a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, especially when facing health constraints. It suggests a "reducetarian" approach, grounded in pragmatism rather than absolute moral rules, which focuses on making choices that meaningfully lessen harm. Recommendations include opting for pasture-raised products over factory-farmed ones, eating larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels on food packaging.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," Mallary Tenore Tarpley writes about her lifelong experience with an eating disorder, challenging the all-or-nothing concept of "full recovery." She argues for embracing a "middle place," where setbacks are accepted as part of an ongoing process, allowing for a full life despite continued struggles. This perspective is particularly relevant as diet culture resurges, and Tarpley discusses how this mindset helps her navigate parenting and a world filled with weight-loss messaging, shifting the focus from perfection to progress.</p>

          <p>As climate change fuels faster and more intense wildfires, some experts and emergency planners argue that evacuation is not always a viable option and that developing official "shelter-in-place" policies is crucial. The article highlights Pepperdine University's long-standing protocol, which has successfully protected students during multiple fires by having them hunker down in fire-resistant buildings on campus. Researchers are now working to develop national standards for different types of fire refuges, recognizing that for many communities in high-risk areas, this may be the only way to save lives.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of UCLA research grants, primarily from the NIH and NSF, have been frozen by the Trump administration following a Justice Department finding that the university inadequately responded to antisemitism on campus. The suspension of $584 million in funding has left thousands of academics in limbo, imperiling potentially lifesaving research in fields like cancer and diagnostics and threatening the salaries of graduate students and other staff. While the university explores stopgap measures, researchers are scrambling to find alternative funding and fear a long-term brain drain from the institution.</p>

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals that despite being a symbolic center of resistance to the Trump administration's immigration policies, California had fewer total ICE arrests than Texas and Florida in early 2025. When adjusted for population, California's arrest rate was even lower, ranking 27th nationally. Experts attribute this to a lack of cooperation from state and local law enforcement, which forces ICE agents to conduct more difficult and visible community-level raids rather than relying on transfers from jails and prisons, a common practice in Republican-led states.</p>
