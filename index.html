        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced a sharper-than-expected contraction of 0.3% in April, primarily due to the implementation of tax increases affecting employers and uncertainty surrounding US trade tariffs impacting British exporters. The services sector was particularly affected. This contraction occurred alongside rising energy, water, and council tax bills for households. These figures were released shortly after Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled spending plans aimed at stimulating economic growth, which included increased funding for the NHS and defense, but budget cuts in other areas.

          <p>The United States is undertaking a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increasing security concerns amid heightened tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy personnel and their families are being relocated. This decision follows reports that Israel was prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising fears of potential retaliation against US interests in Iraq. Despite the evacuation, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Muscat to discuss Iran's nuclear program, even as President Trump reiterates that the US does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. </p>

          <p>Viktor Gyokeres, once a little-known player who never played a Premier League game for Brighton, has transformed into a highly sought-after striker in Europe after scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting CP.

Sporting's president states they have not received an offer, but would consider one above Â£59m.

          <p>Los Angeles is under a second consecutive night of curfew following nearly a week of unrest sparked by US immigration raids, with multiple arrests made for curfew violations. Since the protests began, nearly 400 people have been arrested, including undocumented migrants and individuals charged with assault and obstruction, including attempted murder of a police officer. A total of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest, with some National Guard troops authorized to detain people until police can arrest them. Mayor Karen Bass has blamed the demonstrations on President Trump's immigration raids, while Trump vows to "liberate" the city. </p>

Other companies like CATL and Roborock are also expanding globally, building international brands with local offices and employees.

The U.S. Attorney's Office requested the removal of a juror due to a lack of candor, suggesting possible bias. A legal expert notes that if a juror lied during the selection process (voir dire), it could cause severe problems. Testimony continued with Diddy's ex-girlfriend, known as "Jane," detailing alleged drug use and hotel nights, while Diddy maintains his innocence throughout the trial, which is expected to conclude by July 4. </p>

          <p>Lady Diana Brittan, the widow of former Home Secretary Lord Leon Brittan, has criticized the decision to drop an investigation into the officer who led an inquiry into false allegations of his involvement in a Westminster paedophile ring. She expressed a lack of trust in the Met Police and the police watchdog, stating the proceedings against Met Police officer Steve Rodhouse were "quietly dropped." Lord Brittan was falsely accused by Carl Beech, who was later jailed for perverting the course of justice and child sexual offences, and Lady Brittan feels her husband's legacy has been permanently tarnished. The IOPC stated it regretted that relevant material only recently came to light. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center amidst ongoing protests in Los Angeles, drawing a mix of cheers and boos. Trump's attendance at the musical, which tells the story of revolution against authoritarianism, was met with irony given his deployment of troops to quell immigration protests. During the event, Trump was questioned about his identification with characters from the play and addressed the ongoing situation with Iran, while some audience members voiced their opposition to his policies. The event aimed to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but was marked by political undertones and cultural clashes. </p>

          <p>A former nuclear cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark legacy of the Cold War era. The Mace B cruise missile launch site, constructed during the U.S. military occupation from 1945 to 1972, serves as a reminder of the island's role in nuclear deployment despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. The site, restored by Soka Gakkai, allows visitors to witness the past presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa, which once hosted approximately 70% of U.S. military facilities in Japan. The missile site had a payload 70 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. </p>
