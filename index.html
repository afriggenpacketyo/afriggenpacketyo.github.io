          <p>Volkswagen's CEO announced a strategic push to strengthen its electromobility dominance in Europe through a new lineup of compact and affordable electric vehicles. The German automaker, already a market leader with 28% market share, unveiled the ID. Cross Concept car, set for a 25,000-euro entry price next year, as part of its fourth new electric model. This initiative focuses on improving software and battery technology, including a unified cell concept, to maintain competitiveness. The article highlights Volkswagen's ambition to further expand its significant market share, particularly ahead of the IAA Mobility car show in Munich.</p>

          <p>China has extended its gold-buying spree for another month, with holdings rising to 74.02 million ounces by August's end, increasing gold's share of total foreign exchange reserves to a record 7.64%. This move reflects Beijing's strategy to diversify reserves due to mounting geopolitical risks and uncertainties regarding the US dollar's long-term stability. Other central banks globally are also increasing gold reserves, with a recent survey indicating 95% expect to boost holdings in the next year. This trend suggests a significant global rebalancing of financial assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores how the international order established after World War II, characterized by institutions like the United Nations, is currently being challenged by both Western nations and China. For the past 80 years, these mechanisms have aimed to prevent major conflicts and foster trade globalization, but recent years have seen accusations from both sides of undermining this order. This analysis delves into historical events, principles, and trends that shaped the post-war world and how current geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, are reshaping global dynamics. The future of global governance is at a critical juncture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asylum applications in the European Union dropped by 23% in the first half of 2025, with 399,000 new requests lodged, a decrease of 114,000 compared to the previous year. Germany, previously the most preferred country, saw the largest decline at 43%, followed by Italy and Spain. This reduction is largely attributed to fewer applications from Syrians, who now form the third-largest group after Venezuelans and Afghans, possibly due to increased hope for stability in Syria. The article suggests this shift is more due to changing circumstances in origin countries than new EU policies.</p>

          <p>A former Army sergeant major, Michael Webber, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting teenage soldier Jaysley Beck, who later died by suicide after being "terrified" by the incident. An inquest found the Army's mishandling of Beck's complaint contributed significantly to her death, as superiors initially tried to dissuade her from reporting the sexual assault. Beck's mother expressed relief at the guilty plea but highlighted the devastating loss, asserting that police involvement from the start could have saved her life. The Army has since apologized and implemented a "zero tolerance" policy for sexual misconduct.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has begun in Florida for the trial of Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump while he played golf last year. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, is representing himself with standby counsel. Prosecutors allege Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks, aiming a rifle before being thwarted by a Secret Service agent. This trial follows another assassination attempt on Trump earlier in Pennsylvania, highlighting ongoing security concerns.</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei's La Libertad Avanza (LLA) party suffered a significant defeat in Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing to the opposition Peronist party by a larger margin than predicted.

This loss is seen as a wake-up call for Milei, who faces criticism over a bribery scandal involving his sister and growing unease about public spending cuts.
