        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deliveries of China's domestically produced C919 narrowbody passenger jet to its top three airlines are reportedly falling behind schedule, raising concerns about potential disruptions in engine supply. Air China and China Eastern Airlines each received only one C919 aircraft in the first half of the year, despite aiming for ten each in 2025, while China Southern Airlines noted financially leasing three, with no ownership mentioned. The Shanghai-based manufacturer, Comac, has seen over 2 million passengers on the C919 since its 2023 commercial launch, but independent analysts suggest it is now encountering "turbulence" in securing crucial engines. This development could impact China's ambitions to challenge the market dominance of Western aviation giants.</p>

          <p>Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe has signed the "Missouri First" congressional redistricting map into law, a move supported by former President Donald Trump that is expected to give Republicans an additional U.S. House seat. This new map targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district, shifting it eastward to include more rural, right-leaning voters, potentially creating a 7-1 Republican advantage in the state's House delegation. The action is part of a broader Republican effort, mirroring similar pushes in Texas and facing Democratic counter-efforts in states like California, to solidify the party's slim House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Cleaver has vowed legal action against the new map.</p>

          <p>A violent weekend across the U.S. was marked by multiple mass shootings, including a deadly attack at a Mormon church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where a 40-year-old gunman killed at least two and injured eight, also setting the building on fire. This incident occurred as Mormons mourned the death of their oldest-ever president, Russell Nelson. Separately, three people died in a North Carolina waterfront bar shooting, two were killed and five injured at a Texas casino, and one woman died in a New Orleans Bourbon Street shooting. These events contribute to a grim statistic of over 320 mass shootings in the U.S. this year, reigniting calls for gun control amid legislative inaction.</p>

          <p>This article explores how to identify and manage friendships with "energy vampires" – individuals who drain your emotional and mental reserves. Common signs include excessive need for attention, constant complaining, and a lack of interest in your life, often leaving you feeling exhausted after interactions. Psychologists and journalists suggest that honest communication is crucial; expressing feelings of not being heard or having space can help maintain the friendship if the other person is receptive. If not, setting clear boundaries, reducing contact, or changing shared activities, like opting for walks over intense conversations, are recommended strategies to protect your well-being.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing constant media speculation about his future and a Campaign Finance Board decision to withhold funds. His departure sets up a three-way contest between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who took office in 2022, faced a tumultuous year marked by a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, which he claimed wrongfully charged him. Both Mamdani and Cuomo have responded to Adams' decision, with Mamdani linking Trump's alleged "meddling" to the race and Cuomo thanking Adams for his leadership.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are poised for a historic mass resignation on Tuesday, a direct outcome of a Trump administration program aimed at drastically cutting the federal workforce. This unprecedented exodus is further compounded by White House directives for federal agencies to draft plans for extensive firings should a government shutdown occur due to ongoing funding disputes in Congress. Employees affected describe a climate of "fear and intimidation" that left them feeling compelled to depart their positions. This development reflects the administration's assertive strategy to reshape government operations and its significant impact on the stability and morale of federal personnel.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations for green marine fuels, particularly methanol, are heavily dependent on establishing a robust supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, president of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already implemented liquefied natural gas and biodiesel fueling operations, the challenge lies in creating a reliable system for importing, storing, and selling mainland-produced green methanol tax-free. This comes as CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, embarks on its maiden voyage with a quarter green methanol fuel mix, despite its higher cost. The company anticipates increasing green methanol usage from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

Despite previous federal court blocks, President Trump aims for a definitive judgment on his order, which unilaterally declares only newborns whose parents have permanent legal status are eligible for U.S. citizenship. The administration argues this policy is crucial for border security and seeks to prevent citizenship for an estimated 255,000 children born annually to non-citizen parents.

Notes found at Jahn's residence revealed a strong animosity towards ICE and a premeditated plan for the attack. Jahn used a legally purchased rifle to fire from a nearby rooftop, intending to harm or kill personnel. The incident resulted in the death of one detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, and critical injuries to two others, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, who were inside targeted vans. Officials also noted Jahn used apps that track ICE agents, and blamed "wild rhetoric" for a significant increase in assaults on officers.</p>

          <p>Tutu Atwell, previously a quiet presence this NFL season, emerged as the hero for the Los Angeles Rams, catching an 88-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford with under two minutes remaining to secure a 27-20 comeback win against the Indianapolis Colts. This pivotal play marked a significant moment for Atwell, who had seen limited targets in earlier games. Stafford also delivered touchdown passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, while Kam Curl contributed two interceptions, improving the Rams' record to 3-1. The team's strengthened run defense also contained Jonathan Taylor, positioning them as potential Super Bowl contenders despite ongoing inconsistencies.</p>

          <p>The Village of Broadview has launched a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter, Asal Rezaei, had her vehicle struck by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent. The incident occurred while Rezaei was alone near an ICE facility, with no active protest, causing chemical agents to engulf her truck and leading to physical distress. Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills condemned the "unprovoked attack" and expects full cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security. This event raises serious concerns about press freedom and the conduct of federal agents, prompting an official inquiry into the agent's actions.</p>

Other incidents include the Newnew Polar Bear damaging two telecommunications cables and a gas pipeline in October 2023, and the Yi Peng 3 severing two data cables in November 2024, with its transponder notably turned off.

The fee aims to control visitor flow and fund maintenance and infrastructure improvements, offering museum and windmill access as a sweetener. While some tourists express hesitation over the cost, local shop and restaurant owners fear a loss of business.

          <p>The increasing use of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro, while offering significant benefits, is raising concerns that obesity management is becoming a "wealth issue." Despite some being available on the NHS, access is tightly restricted by a "postcode lottery" and varying eligibility thresholds, leading thousands to pay privately at costs between £100-£350 monthly. This creates a two-tier system, disproportionately benefiting the affluent, especially as pharmaceutical companies consider price increases. Experts warn against medicalizing obesity without addressing underlying social issues like the "broken food system" and health inequalities, where deprived areas face higher obesity rates and fewer healthy options.</p>
