          <p>President Trump announced plans to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to address protests he labels as domestic terrorism, specifically targeting groups like Antifa near federal facilities. The move, authorizing "full force if necessary," has been strongly condemned by local and state officials, including Portland's mayor and Oregon's governor, who argue there is no need for federal military intervention. This action represents an escalation of the administration's strategy of using federal forces in cities to quell unrest, a tactic previously seen in Los Angeles and Washington D.C.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry reported multiple drone sightings over several military bases, including Skrydstrup Air Base and the country's largest, Karup Air Base. This follows recent incidents where drones caused temporary shutdowns at Danish airports, raising significant security concerns across Northern Europe. Similar unexplained drone activity has also been reported in neighboring Germany and Norway, prompting NATO to affirm a resolute response against such provocations. The events have led to heightened vigilance and discussions about bolstering anti-drone capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) has drawn significant backlash for a social media post honoring Assata Shakur, a Black liberation activist who was convicted of murdering a state trooper in 1973. Shakur, who was on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists list, recently died in Cuba after escaping prison and receiving asylum there decades ago. Critics condemned the union's tribute, describing it as unhinged and a disservice to its role in education, highlighting the CTU's history of controversial political stances. The post praised Shakur as a "revolutionary fighter" and a "leader of freedom."</p>

          <p>Austin police have identified a suspect in the cold-case murders of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop in 1991, a crime that has remained unsolved for over three decades. Through advanced DNA testing, investigators linked Robert Eugene Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, to the crime scene. The case previously saw two men wrongfully convicted and later exonerated after new DNA evidence emerged. This breakthrough brings potential closure to the families of the victims and marks a significant development in one of Austin's most notorious unsolved cases.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis became activists against AI-generated deepfake pornography after discovering a man had used their social media photos to create explicit content on a "nudify" website. Their experience highlights the rapid proliferation and accessibility of generative AI tools that can be used for malicious purposes without legal consequence, as creating the images was not illegal. The women are now working with Minnesota state senator Erin Maye Quade on a bill to hold AI companies accountable, pushing for stronger federal laws to address this issue.</p>

          <p>Robert Cary McNair Jr., son of the Houston Texans' co-founders, has filed a lawsuit against the National Football League, alleging "tortious interference." The suit claims the NFL conspired with his brother, current team CEO Cal McNair, to restructure the family's business and trust. McNair Jr. alleges this was done to remove him from influential roles and silence him after he raised questions about player scandals potentially implicating the league. He is seeking over $60 million in damages for the alleged effort to sideline him from NFL-related matters.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating their policies would "tear this country apart." He specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, forcing them to reapply for visas every five years, calling it one of the most shocking policies he has heard. Starmer is facing pressure from poor polling numbers and speculation about his leadership, and he aims to use the conference to present Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal" as an alternative to what he terms Reform's "toxic divide and decline."</p>

          <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has fired over a dozen agents who were photographed kneeling during the Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C., in 2020. The termination letters reportedly cited a "lack of judgement," though the kneeling was seen by some as a de-escalation tactic. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings, accusing FBI Director Kash Patel of violating the agents' rights and weakening the Bureau. This move is part of a broader personnel purge under Patel that has raised concerns about declining morale and politicization within the agency.</p>

This would create a dilemma for the Fed, which is mandated to maintain both price stability and full employment. The central bank might be forced to navigate a situation where strong GDP growth conflicts with a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is addressing the U.S. housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory setting, a process it claims is up to 20% cheaper and twice as fast as traditional on-site building. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. By using lean manufacturing principles, Fading West aims to make homeownership more attainable for essential workers and others priced out of the market. This approach could offer a scalable solution to the nation's persistent housing shortage.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus, which were imposed following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This decision means athletes from both countries can now regain full membership rights and potentially compete under their national flags at the 2026 Winter Paralympics. Ukraine's sports minister strongly condemned the move, stating those who voted for it betrayed Olympic values. The decision contrasts with the International Olympic Committee's policy, which still requires Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals without national symbols.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent economic assertions reveals a mix of accurate, misleading, and false statements. While mortgage rates and gasoline prices have seen some decline, his claims that grocery prices are down and that inflation has been "defeated" are incorrect, as both continue to rise. The stock market has indeed reached record highs, but claims of "booming" manufacturing are contradicted by a net loss of jobs in the sector since he took office. Wage growth for blue-collar workers has been strong, but overall wage growth remains relatively flat when accounting for inflation.</p>

May, who resigned from the legislature earlier this year and is representing himself, faces five to twenty years in prison for each of the five counts.

The author contends that there is no proven causal link between the medication and autism, and that an untreated fever during pregnancy can pose real risks. The piece frames the president's comments as another instance of controlling women's bodies and perpetuating a history of dismissing female pain, fitting into a broader pattern of shaming mothers for their healthcare decisions.</p>
