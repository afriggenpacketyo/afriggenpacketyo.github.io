            <p>The CNBC Investing Club lowered its price target for BlackRock from $1,150 to $1,050 following the company's Q1 earnings report, aligning with the updated mean analyst target. The adjustment accounts for softness in assets under management and management fees due to recent market volatility. Despite near-term market pressures, the Club maintains a positive long-term outlook on BlackRock, citing its expansion into private markets and technology services via the Aladdin platform as reasons for a higher valuation premium. The Club also plans to reposition its portfolio to mitigate tariff risks. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump reaffirmed that Iran must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons as the U.S. prepares for further talks with Iranian officials in Italy. He stated that Iran desires to negotiate but lacks the understanding of how to proceed, and confirmed upcoming discussions aimed at resolving the nuclear program issue. While describing the previous talks as 'positive and constructive', Trump cautioned that unresolved issues remain. He also reiterated the threat of military action if Iran does not cease its nuclear ambitions, while asserting he could easily solve the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply as investors reacted to tariff-related news and continued volatility in the bond market. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped significantly following President Trump's announcement of tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers, and electronic components. Despite the exemptions, uncertainty remains regarding the permanence of these measures, leading to speculation about potential dumping of Treasury holdings by foreign investors. The bond market has experienced unusual volatility recently, with significant yield increases followed by this week's decline, reflecting investor unease over trade policy.</p>

In both cases, he expects the Fed to cut interest rates, with the timing depending on the size of the tariffs.

            <p>The Trump administration has officially canceled Temporary Protection Status (TPS) for Afghans, reversing a previous extension by former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. This decision, based on a review of conditions in Afghanistan, will make Afghans deportable after May 20.

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to trigger a reshoring boom in U.S. manufacturing. Most companies surveyed cite cost as the primary deterrent, with nearly three-quarters stating it as the top reason against reshoring. Instead, many companies are considering relocating supply chains to lower-tariff countries. Automation is expected to play a significant role in any potential return of manufacturing to the U.S., with the majority anticipating greater use of automation over human workers.</p>
