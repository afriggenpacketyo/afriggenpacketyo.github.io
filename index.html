          <p>Iran's deputy foreign minister has stated that the United States must guarantee it will not conduct further military strikes before any new diplomatic negotiations can occur. This demand follows a recent US bombing raid on three Iranian nuclear sites, which disrupted a planned sixth round of talks. Tehran insists on its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes, rejecting claims it is developing nuclear weapons, and views US threats as "the law of the jungle." The Iranian government is currently seeking clarity from the US on whether aggression will cease during potential future dialogue, emphasizing the need for confidence-building measures.</p>

          <p>Throughout June, cities across the globe have hosted Pride Month events, celebrating the LGBTQ community while highlighting the ongoing fight for equal rights and inclusion. These celebrations trace their origins to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The annual tradition, which first received federal recognition in the U.S. in 1999, was marked by vibrant parades and festivals from Kathmandu to Washington, D.C. New York City's 2025 Pride March, in particular, drew large crowds to honor the legacy of Stonewall.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek re-election in 2026 has drawn strong responses from across the political spectrum. Former Senator Jeff Flake, a notable Trump critic, suggested Tillis could only win by compromising his beliefs, while Senator Bernie Sanders characterized the modern Republican Party as a "cult" that stifles independent thought. The retirement follows Tillis's vote against President Trump's major legislative bill, which prompted Trump to label him a "grandstander" and vow to support a primary challenger. Tillis cited the increasing polarization and "political theater" in Washington as key factors in his decision to leave office.</p>

          <p>According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Senate's version of President Trump's major budget bill could cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance coverage. The CBO also projects the legislation would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. These figures have intensified the political debate surrounding the bill, which includes significant cuts to Medicaid and tax reductions that primarily benefit wealthier individuals. Despite narrow procedural passage, the bill's future remains uncertain as Republican leaders can only afford to lose three votes from their party. (not investment advice)</p>

Drawing a comparison to the period after the 1989 Tiananmen Square disruptions, he notes that American students and scholars are once again beginning to return to China, acting as pioneers in re-establishing cultural and academic ties. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed an incredibly warm and welcoming reception.

The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service.

Diesel stated this decision was one of three conditions he gave Universal Studios, alongside returning the franchise to its Los Angeles street-racing roots.

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, has apologized after mistakenly notifying thousands of Eurojackpot players that they had won millions more than their actual prizes. The error occurred when converting winnings from Euros to Norwegian kroner, where a multiplication was used instead of a division, inflating the amounts by a factor of 10,000. While no incorrect payments were made, the company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, expressed deep regret for the disappointment caused and subsequently announced her resignation. The incident is the latest in a series of technical issues for the company, which is now investigating the cause of the failure.</p>

The decision ensures he will surpass his shared record with Vince Carter for the most seasons played in the NBA. James is also approaching another milestone, needing only 50 more regular-season appearances to break the all-time record for games played, currently held by Robert Parish.</p>

Warner stated on "Face the Nation" that the university received explicit threats of cuts to jobs, research funding, and student aid if Ryan did not resign by a specific deadline. The pressure was reportedly linked to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

          <p>A concerning trend of rising right-wing extremism and racism is spreading among youth in eastern German cities like Dessau, where Nazi-era symbols and slogans are becoming more common. Experts warn of a radicalization of young people, with some viewing far-right affiliation as "cool" and part of pop culture. This shift is occurring in a region that has faced economic decline and depopulation since reunification, despite significant investment. The rise of the far-right AfD party, which recently saw a politician with a neo-Nazi past elected as Dessau's mayor, reflects the growing mainstream acceptance of extremist views in the area.</p>

          <p>An analysis of battle damage assessment (BDA) history suggests that recent US strikes likely inflicted severe, lasting damage on Iran's nuclear program, contrary to some preliminary, hasty reports. The assessment considers the advanced precision munitions used, such as the 15-ton GBU-57 "bunker buster," and the ideal operating conditions for the sophisticated B-2 bombers. Furthermore, the US attack was the culmination of a broader 12-day Israeli campaign that targeted the entire nuclear ecosystem, including scientists and design facilities.
