          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki from Allen, Texas, emerged as the winner of the 2025 Scripps National Spelling Bee, marking its 100th anniversary. Faizan, who was last year's runner-up, triumphed over eight other finalists after several rounds of intense competition. The final showdown saw Faizan correctly spell "éclaircissement," a noun meaning "clearing up of something obscure," without hesitation, leading to an emotional celebration on stage. The competition, held just outside Washington, D.C., featured 243 young spellers who had advanced through local and regional bees, with Faizan earning over $50,000 in cash and prizes.</p>

          <p>Kell Morris, a 61-year-old Alaska man, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours during a hike near Godwin Glacier. His wife, Jo Roop, a retired Alaska State Trooper, kept his head above water while waiting for rescue. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and used its helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. Firefighters used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a local hospital, where he was observed for two nights before being released unscathed; Morris attributes his survival to luck and his wife's quick thinking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent US Court of International Trade ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, leading to a legal battle that could limit his economic policy tool. The court initially ordered the White House to remove almost all tariffs, arguing Trump exceeded his emergency powers, but this was stayed by a federal appeals court pending further review. The administration argued that restricting Trump's tariff power would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. The debate centers on whether tariffs should be legislated by Congress, which would reduce the element of surprise, or remain a presidential prerogative.</p>

His presence also raised concerns about conflicts of interest due to his companies' business dealings with the government, and the elimination of USAID programs signaled a shift towards US isolationism.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily allowed President Trump to continue collecting import taxes, suspending a lower court ruling that deemed many of his global tariffs illegal. The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision improperly challenged the president's authority and threatened trade negotiations. The case originated from challenges by small businesses and states, who claimed Trump overstepped his power by imposing the duties. While the White House seeks a permanent reversal, the tariffs can be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5.</p>

Up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand will also be placed between two crucial points along the rail between Mariposa and North beaches.

          <p>Natalie Phelps, a 43-year-old mother with stage 4 colorectal cancer, reports that her life-saving treatment at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been delayed due to cuts implemented by the Trump administration. The cell-based immunotherapy trial she was scheduled to begin in mid-June has been pushed back to mid-July due to staff reductions. Phelps' case has gained attention, leading to congressional hearings and a dispute between a Democratic senator and the US health secretary. The cuts have affected NIH scientists and grants, impacting treatment for cancer patients and delaying research discoveries.</p>

The technology could strengthen Beijing's position in international disarmament talks and spark debate about AI's role in managing weapons of mass destruction. The project, built on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists, faced hurdles including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and ensuring the system would not leak technological secrets.

          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing the leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) due to ongoing frustrations within the White House regarding the number of immigration arrests and deportations. Kenneth Genalo, head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, and Robert Hammer, who leads ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, is being reassigned. The changes are framed as a way to support ICE's increasing operational tempo and meet the administration's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal unauthorized migrants. The White House is pushing ICE to make at least 3,000 arrests per day, aiming for an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement.</p>
