          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has announced a new 10% tariff on countries aligning with what he terms "Anti-American policies" of the BRICS alliance, a group including China, Russia, and India, designed to challenge Western dominance. This threat, made via social media, follows BRICS leaders' criticism of US tariff policies and their call for reforms to global financial institutions. The additional import taxes, intended to boost American manufacturing and protect jobs, are slated to begin on August 1st. This article underscores the escalating trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions as the BRICS bloc seeks to increase its international standing.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a depression after making landfall in South Carolina and is now moving into northern North Carolina. Despite the downgrade, significant flash flooding concerns persist across central North Carolina and south-central Virginia, with forecasts predicting up to six inches of rain. Chatham County has reported over 100 flooded roads and a highway collapse, leading to ongoing rescue operations for stranded motorists, though no immediate injuries have been reported. This article highlights the system's continued impact and the broader context of an active Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 03:05:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, such leave is only available for losses after 24 weeks or for children under 18. This change, championed by Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Labour MP Sarah Owen, aims to acknowledge the emotional grief of early pregnancy loss, allowing parents at least one week off work. The article notes this is a significant step towards recognizing these losses as true bereavements, preventing individuals from returning to work before they are ready.</p>

          <p>Global birth rates are plummeting, with women worldwide having fewer than half as many children as in the 1960s, leading to concerns about depopulation and future workforce shortages. This article explores how increased female freedom and economic independence are driving this shift, with many choosing to delay or opt out of parenthood due to career focus and financial considerations. While some see environmental benefits, the trend poses challenges for social safety nets like Social Security and could necessitate increased immigration.

          <p>This article argues that Europe's escalating housing crisis, marked by soaring rents and unattainable homeownership, is a "political timebomb" fueled by the financial sector's increasing control over residential properties. Since the 2008 crisis, institutional investors have tripled their real estate holdings, viewing housing as a lucrative asset class. This has led to practices like "renoviction" and increased prices, disproportionately affecting renters and minority groups. The article contends that governments have weakened tenant protections to incentivize private investment, leading to widespread disillusionment and fueling far-right political movements. It calls for fundamental structural changes to reclaim housing as a public priority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research indicates a single gene therapy injection could reverse hearing loss in weeks for individuals with congenital deafness or severe impairment caused by OTOF gene mutations. A clinical trial showed significant hearing improvement in all 10 participants, with one 7-year-old regaining almost full hearing. The therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver a functional OTOF gene to the inner ear.
