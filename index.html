          <h2>Japanese Survey Reveals Strong Support for Regulating Election Social Media</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 23:36:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that a majority of Japanese citizens, approximately 58%, believe that social media platforms should be legally regulated during elections to combat the spread of unverified information. The survey highlights growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, citing a recent gubernatorial election where accusations of abuse of power were dismissed through online campaigns. While some respondents feel social media operators should self-regulate, the overall sentiment leans toward legislative intervention, particularly as Japan has already enacted laws aimed at removing defamatory content online, though its effectiveness remains limited. The survey also touched on constitutional matters, revealing divided opinions on revising Article 9, which renounces war, and broad support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames.</p>

          <p>According to a report by the Washington Post, the Trump administration planned to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency by 1,200 positions and implement similar cuts at other intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency. The reductions were expected to occur over several years, largely through reduced hiring. The CIA issued a statement asserting that these changes were intended to align the agency with Trump's national security priorities, infuse it with new energy, and improve its mission effectiveness. The Trump administration also eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies, though some of these efforts were temporarily blocked by a judge. The report also mentioned the abrupt firing of Tim Haugh, the general who led the NSA and the Pentagon's Cyber Command.</p>

The incident occurred on the school campus, and the victims, believed to be female employees of the college, were transported to a nearby hospital with critical injuries. The suspect, who was possibly wearing a security uniform, was apprehended in Pico-Union after his family called 911 to report that he had shot two women, and they informed the authorities that the gun was in the backseat of his car.

          <p>Federal transportation safety officials are investigating an incident where two commercial flights had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army helicopter entering restricted airspace. The helicopter, a Black Hawk headed to the Pentagon, caused air traffic controllers to instruct Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to abort their landings. The incident has sparked outrage among officials, including Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who questioned the disregard for helicopter restrictions implemented after a fatal midair collision in January.

Emails reveal that the city had considered reactivating the Pacific Palisades Reservoir but ultimately deemed it too risky due to structural and safety concerns.

          <p>China's private sector has been given new legal recourse with the passage of the Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20. The law aims to bolster the private economy and curb administrative powers, potentially allowing firms to challenge local governments in court. The legislation also seeks to protect private businesses from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers are closely monitoring the law's implementation to assess its effectiveness in safeguarding the private sector and promoting fair adjudication in legal disputes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. Judge Beryl Howell's ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie for representing clients and causes disliked by Trump. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins Coie as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The ruling underscores the importance of protecting lawyers' ability to represent clients without fear of retribution.</p>
