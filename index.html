          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington is set to hear arguments regarding the legality of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The case, brought by several states and businesses, challenges the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs, arguing it bypasses congressional authority. The outcome could significantly impact the administration's trade negotiations with China and other nations, as no previous president has used the IEEPA to justify such measures. The legal challenge also targets tariffs on fentanyl-related imports from China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

The couple, Clinton and Cristen Brink, were found deceased on a hiking trail, while their two young daughters were unharmed. The arrest followed a five-day search aided by public tips and video footage from other park visitors. McGann, who had a history of complaints regarding his conduct as a teacher in Texas, was apprehended in a nearby city and faces two counts of capital murder.</p>

A victory would mark the first 3-0 series win for the Lions since their 1974 tour of South Africa. The Wallabies will be missing key players Rob Valetini and Allan Alaalatoa due to injuries.</p>

          <p>An issue with the UK's air traffic control system on Wednesday led to significant flight disruptions, including cancellations and delays at all UK airports. NATS, the national air traffic service, reported a "radar-related" problem that required a temporary reduction in flight traffic for safety, though it was resolved within an hour. Despite systems returning to normal, passengers are urged to check with airlines as the backlog is expected to cause lingering effects for days during the peak summer travel season. The transport secretary is meeting with NATS to investigate the cause and prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including ten prominent lawyers, has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria outlined in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single, effective government. This intervention follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions. The government has countered that it does not subscribe to the convention and that recognition is based on established international views.</p>

          <p>China's top cybersecurity agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), has summoned Nvidia to address security risks associated with its H20 AI chips. The regulator is concerned about potential vulnerabilities, "backdoors," and tracking features, citing calls from U.S. lawmakers to implement such location-verification technology on advanced chips. This scrutiny from Beijing adds a new geopolitical challenge for Nvidia, which had anticipated resuming shipments of the China-specific H20 chips. The inquiry highlights the ongoing tension between Washington's export controls and the company's access to the lucrative Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, professions requiring physical labor and direct human interaction, such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers, were identified as the most AI-safe.

Though his efforts didn't secure an overall win for his team, they were instrumental in wearing down Pogačar.

          <p>Britain's Emma Raducanu defeated American Peyton Stearns 6-2, 6-4 to advance to the third round of the Canadian Open in Montreal. This victory continues her strong performance on the North American hard-court circuit ahead of the US Open, where she was a champion in 2021. Raducanu, who was born in Canada, overcame a brief deficit in the second set by winning four consecutive games to secure the match. She will next face American fifth seed and Wimbledon runner-up Amanda Anisimova, as she continues to build momentum in the lead-up to the year's final Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of a sacred collection of ancient jewels, known as the Piprahwa Gems, to India. The jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, were withdrawn from a planned auction in Hong Kong following pressure from the Indian government and Buddhist leaders who argued the sacred relics should not be commodified. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the gems and will place them on permanent public display in India. The collection was originally unearthed in 1898 from a stupa in northern India and had remained in a private British collection for over a century.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's August 1st tariff deadline approaching, the U.S. has secured framework deals with eight partners, including the UK, EU, and Japan, while others like Canada, Mexico, and India face steep new levies. The deals establish baseline tariffs, such as 15% for the EU and Japan, which are higher than previous rates but avert even harsher threatened penalties. These agreements often include significant concessions, like large investment commitments in the U.S. Meanwhile, China's trade dispute remains in a state of flux with ongoing talks and temporary truces over its high "reciprocal" tariff rate.

          <p>India has appeared unfazed by the U.S. threat of a 25% tariff, choosing not to rush into a trade agreement ahead of the deadline. Analysts suggest this resistance is primarily to protect its agricultural sector, a crucial and politically sensitive part of its economy, from U.S. competition. Indian officials have stated they will not negotiate based on deadlines and will prioritize national interest. Strategically, some experts believe the U.S. has an interest in not alienating India, viewing it as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a manufacturing alternative to China.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a second-quarter operating profit of 4.7 trillion Korean won, a significant drop from the previous year and below analyst expectations. The decline was driven by a staggering 93.8% year-over-year profit slump in its crucial chip division, attributed to inventory adjustments and the impact of China-related export restrictions. While the company's mobile division saw improved sales, the overall results reflect a challenging semiconductor market. Despite this, Samsung anticipates a performance rebound in the second half of the year, fueled by a gradual IT industry recovery and growing demand for AI-related products.
