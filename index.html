            <p>Washwood Heath, a community health clinic in a deprived area of Birmingham, is being touted as a potential model for reforming the NHS in England. The clinic brings together hospital doctors, GPs, social care teams, and charity staff under one roof to provide integrated care for frequent users of health services. The goal is to address social issues like loneliness and housing problems alongside medical needs, aiming to keep people well and out of hospitals. While the model has shown promising results in reducing hospital visits, questions remain about its feasibility on a larger scale due to funding and logistical challenges.</p>

            <p>As the UK faces economic uncertainty exacerbated by potential tariffs from the US, Labour leader Keir Starmer is grappling with how to respond. New polling suggests public concern over the tariffs' impact on the cost of living, raising questions about the government's economic policies. Starmer reaffirmed his commitment not to raise income tax, VAT, or National Insurance for employees, but avoided directly addressing whether he might loosen fiscal rules in response to the economic hit. This signals a cautious approach amidst growing economic anxieties.</p>

            <p>To counteract the economic strain caused by increased tariffs from the US, China is focusing on boosting household income to stimulate domestic spending. While China has made progress in reducing its vulnerability to external shocks through its "dual circulation" strategy, its export sector is expected to slow down due to the tariffs. Despite pledges to further open up to global investment and trade, the external environment could be less accommodating for Chinese exporters, requiring a greater emphasis on internal economic drivers.</p>
