          <p>The Tall Ships Races, described as Scotland's largest tourist event of the year, has commenced in Aberdeen. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are anticipated to view the dozens of international vessels, with festivities including concerts by bands like Deacon Blue. Despite a yellow weather warning for heavy rain, the event began with large crowds, celebrating the city's maritime history and fostering international friendship among young sailing crews. This marks the third time Aberdeen has hosted the event, which runs for four days before the ships sail to Norway.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's tariff policies reveals mixed results more than 100 days since their implementation. Economists note that the tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and spurred some corporate commitments for U.S. investment, aligning with the administration's "America First" goals. However, experts also express caution, pointing out that these investment promises are long-term and could be reversed. Concerns remain about the potential for rising consumer prices and inflation, as the effective tariff rate reaches its highest point since 1910. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The government of Congo and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group have signed a declaration of principles aimed at establishing a permanent ceasefire in the conflict-ridden eastern Congo. The agreement, brokered in Qatar, commits both parties to signing a comprehensive peace deal within a month, aligning with a U.S.-facilitated agreement from June. This marks the first direct commitment since the rebels captured key cities, a major escalation in a conflict that has displaced millions. The success of the deal hinges on complex issues, including the withdrawal of rebel and Rwandan forces.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain across most of England and parts of Scotland, indicating a risk of flash flooding. The alerts, which follow a recent heatwave, warn of potential travel disruptions, power cuts, and fast-flowing water. The dry, parched ground from the preceding warm spell increases the likelihood of severe runoff, as it is less able to absorb the sudden, heavy rainfall. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the South East has ended.</p>

Proponents argue the measure provides crucial financial and emotional relief, easing the burden of bills during an incredibly challenging time.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article discusses recent proposals in Europe to eliminate national holidays for economic reasons, connecting it to former President Trump's suggestion of having too many holidays, made on Juneteenth. The author argues that while Trump's motivation was likely not purely economic, the idea of re-evaluating holidays is worth considering. The piece contends that if a holiday were to be cut in the U.S., it should be one with problematic historical origins, like Thanksgiving, rather than Juneteenth. The author highlights Juneteenth's economic and historical significance as marking the end of slavery, which ultimately spurred massive economic growth.</p>

The project involved relocating frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula to their historic range, a complex international collaboration. A key breakthrough came from using a custom-built artificial intelligence model to sift through thousands of hours of audio recordings to detect the frogs' mating calls. This technological assistance confirmed the re-introduced population was successfully reproducing, marking a significant victory in the fight against extinction for the threatened species.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the persistent connection between Donald Trump and the late Jeffrey Epstein, which has become a focal point of right-wing conspiracy theories that Trump himself has fueled. The author notes the irony that while Trump's base dismisses numerous credible sexual abuse allegations against him, they are fixated on an Epstein-related pedophile conspiracy that they believe implicates his political enemies. The article argues that Trump is now trapped by this narrative, as his administration's failure to produce a mythical "client list" of Democrats has caused frustration among his most ardent supporters, creating a "conspiracy theory gap" he cannot easily close.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Six months into his term, President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy is facing scrutiny as consumer prices show an upward trend, contradicting White House claims of low inflation. The implementation of widespread tariffs has led to price increases on various imported goods, with economists noting the costs are ultimately passed to consumers. This has created a tense standoff with the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates on hold to assess the tariffs' inflationary impact. Trump has publicly criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for this inaction, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas has passed a new law, the "Life of the Mother Act," intended to provide clarity for doctors regarding the medical emergency exceptions in the state's strict abortion ban. The law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to justify an abortion and confirms that the burden of proof lies with the state in any prosecution. While supported by some medical groups as a step in the right direction, critics argue it does not go far enough, as it fails to add exceptions for sexual assault or fatal fetal anomalies. Its ultimate impact remains uncertain, as doctors may still fear the severe penalties for misinterpretation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is demanding that states hand over personal data, including names and Social Security numbers, for all SNAP recipients since 2020, sparking a federal lawsuit and significant privacy concerns. Anti-hunger and privacy advocates, along with several SNAP recipients, are challenging the unprecedented data collection, arguing it violates federal privacy laws. Critics fear the data could be used for purposes beyond program integrity, such as immigration enforcement, turning a vital food assistance program into a tool for mass surveillance.

          <p>To curb impulsive and emotionally-driven spending, financial therapists and consumer experts suggest asking a series of introspective questions before making a purchase. They advise considering whether the purchase is a genuine need or an attempt to fill an emotional void, such as hunger, anger, or loneliness. It is also important to evaluate if the spending fits within your budget without drawing from essential funds, and to research products to ensure value. By being more intentional and aware of the motivations behind a purchase, consumers can make more mindful financial decisions and avoid regrettable buys.</p>

The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal action, citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" that being on the list would directly lead to an individual being targeted, a conclusion disputed by those affected.</p>

For many Muslims, Mamdani's rise represents a new era of political leadership that challenges long-held assumptions about who can represent New York. His success is seen as a sign of hope and growing political power in a city marked by post-9/11 Islamophobia.</p>

The NTSB, which is assisting in the investigation, emphasized that complex probes take time and that drawing conclusions now is irresponsible.
