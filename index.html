          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to ban 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues. The initial ban, based on the Navy's own search terms, included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". However, the new review identified only about 20 books needing removal pending further assessment by the Department of Defense. This reversal ensures nearly all originally pulled books are back in circulation at the Nimitz Library and other Navy educational institutions, aligning with directives issued by the President and Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling new international students and retaining current foreign students, citing an "unsafe campus environment" due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators, many of whom are foreign students. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, a move Harvard calls unlawful. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard failed to adhere to the law and fostered violence and antisemitism. A federal judge issued an injunction that could block the administration from acting on its threat against international students currently enrolled at Harvard.</p>

          <p>During a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump made several contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa. Trump played a video purporting to show burial sites of murdered white farmers, which was actually footage of a memorial for a farming couple. He also claimed there was a "genocide" occurring against white farmers, which is not supported by available data. Trump played footage of rallies where participants sang "Kill the Boer," led by figures like Julius Malema, who does not hold an official government position.</p>

Experts note the difficulty in defining antisemitism amid heightened political outrage over the war's humanitarian impact.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are advancing a bill that introduces nationwide work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. The GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act would require certain Medicaid enrollees to report at least 80 hours of monthly work or community activity to maintain benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to this and other provisions. Critics argue that these requirements will harm vulnerable populations without significantly improving employment rates, citing the failed implementation of similar policies in Arkansas during the Trump administration.</p>

The European Central Bank warned that President Trump's tariffs pose risks to the global financial system, and Moody's downgraded the U.S. creditworthiness, citing the rising national deficit. This shift reflects a changing perception of the U.S. as a riskier place to invest compared to six months prior.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the US, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>Annuities are pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. Fixed-term annuities, variable or indexed annuities, and annuities with a withdrawal rider can all run out of money.</p>
