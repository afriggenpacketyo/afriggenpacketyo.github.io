          <p>Reports indicate that Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While explosions were reported and missiles were seen over Doha, Qatari authorities claimed successful interception, with no reported casualties. President Trump acknowledged the attack as a "weak response" and expressed gratitude for early notice, which he said prevented casualties. The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of sovereignty and international law, stating they reserve the right to respond, while Iran's supreme leader asserted they did not intend to harm anyone. The tone of the article reflects a tense but contained situation. Optimism is slightly higher due to the lack of casualties.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration permission to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own, without providing advance warning or the opportunity to challenge the deportations based on potential torture or death. This decision overturns a lower court injunction and will remain in effect during the appeals process. The dissenting justices criticized the decision as an abuse of the Court's discretion, highlighting the risk of sending individuals to unsafe countries. This ruling has significant implications for due process and the safety of vulnerable immigrants. The summary reflects a somber and concerning development regarding immigration policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has reignited the debate over war powers. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while the president serves as Commander in Chief. Legal experts argue that historically, presidents have engaged in military actions without formal declarations, but legislative approval is generally required. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, but presidents have often bypassed its requirements, leading to ongoing tensions between the executive and legislative branches. The article reflects the ongoing struggle between the executive and legislative branches regarding war powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent price increases. While initial market reactions saw price fluctuations, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions and potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities could still disrupt the energy market. Analysts suggest that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could cause prices to spike significantly, impacting economies worldwide, although limited disruptions would likely have a limited impact. The analysis suggests a volatile market influenced by geopolitical factors. (not investment advice)</p>
