          <p>A tragic school trip ended when a coach carrying students from Minehead Middle School crashed near Wheddon Cross, Somerset, resulting in the death of a 10-year-old boy. Four other people, two children and two adults, are still receiving hospital care following the incident where the coach slid down a 20-foot slope. The local community has responded with immense support, raising over £40,000 through fundraisers to assist those affected by the horrific event. The school, which was temporarily closed, is scheduled to reopen as the police investigation into the crash continues.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the next two weeks will be historic, as the Trump administration pushes to finalize trade deals before an August 1 tariff deadline. Lutnick asserted that President Trump's strategy of threatening steep tariffs has successfully brought numerous countries, including the European Union, to the negotiating table to open their markets to American goods. He anticipates that smaller countries will likely face a baseline 10% tariff, while larger economies must either forge new agreements or pay higher rates. The secretary dismissed concerns about consumer price hikes, arguing the policy will bolster American manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a social media post, Donald Trump called for the Washington Commanders and Cleveland Guardians to revert to their previous team names, which were changed due to being considered racially insensitive to Native Americans. Trump claimed that a large number of Native Americans want the names restored to honor their heritage and prestige, which he says is being taken away. He referred to Washington's NFL team as the "Whatever's" and incorrectly identified Cleveland's MLB team as one of baseball's "original six." Both franchises changed their monikers in recent years amid a broader cultural reckoning over race in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was marked by public frustration over rising prices and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. A significant loss would further weaken the coalition's power, following the loss of its lower house majority last year. Analysts note that voter discontent and a shift of conservative support to more right-wing parties have contributed to the poor showing, potentially leading to political instability and leadership challenges within the LDP.</p>

          <p>Ten officials in China's Gansu province are under investigation following a lead poisoning scandal at a kindergarten where test results were deliberately falsified. An official probe found that the provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and a local hospital manipulated testing procedures and results for children from the affected kindergarten. Senior provincial health and municipal party officials are among those being investigated for oversight failures. The government has issued a public apology and promised to provide free medical treatment for the affected children and their families.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest AI's Role in Recent Layoffs Is Larger Than Companies Disclose</h2>

          <p>While companies often cite restructuring or optimization for recent job cuts, employment experts suspect that artificial intelligence is a larger, unstated factor. Firms like IBM and Klarna have been transparent about replacing roles with AI, but many others may be using vague terminology to avoid public and employee backlash. This strategic silence allows companies to reshape their workforce with automation while managing public perception. However, experts also note that companies sometimes overestimate AI's capabilities, leading them to quietly outsource or rehire to fill the gaps left by displaced workers when the technology underperforms.</p>

          <p>The family of an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, Luis Leon, reports he was secretly deported after visiting an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Leon, who was granted political asylum in 1987, was detained by ICE officers and, according to his family, sent to Guatemala, a country with which he has no connection. His family was initially unable to locate him and was even falsely told he had died, before learning of his hospitalization in Guatemala. ICE has stated it is investigating the matter concerning the elderly man who suffers from several health conditions.</p>

          <p>A cast member of the opera "Il trovatore" unfurled a large Palestinian flag on stage during the final curtain call at London's Royal Opera House. Video of the incident shows a brief struggle as a venue official attempted to take the flag, but the performer resisted. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the act as a "spontaneous and unauthorised action," stating it was inappropriate and contrary to their commitment to political impartiality. The protest, which occurred on the opera's closing night, drew a mixed reaction from the audience, with some booing and others reportedly showing support.</p>

The attacks also affected Kaluga International Airport and regions near the Ukrainian border. This event marks another instance of the ongoing conflict causing travel chaos in Russia, as both sides continue their military engagements nearly three and a half years into the full-scale invasion.</p>

Kennedy Jr. regarding vaccine safety. The article refutes Kennedy's claims that children receive 92 mandatory shots, that most vaccines are not tested against placebos, and that 97% of federal vaccine advisers have industry conflicts of interest. Citing a database of hundreds of clinical trials, the author clarifies that the childhood schedule involves fewer shots with a significantly lower antigen load than in the past and that every routine vaccine has been tested against a placebo or inert substance.</p>

Sources suggest the meeting could happen either on the sidelines of the October summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. Relations between the two nations have been stabilizing after initial tensions following Trump's return to office, marked by a recent meeting between their top diplomats and a preliminary trade deal.

          <p>Traditional metrics for the U.S. labor market, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming increasingly obsolete in a changing economy. This article argues that factors like the rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work efficiencies make "jobs" a poor measure of economic health. Instead, it proposes a shift towards measuring income, suggesting a metric like the percentage of the population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold would be more relevant. This approach would better capture the complex reality of how Americans earn money today.</p>

Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by the I-40 interstate in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events, tours, and improvements to attract the thousands of tourists expected to travel the famous route for its centennial. They hope the anniversary will breathe new life into the area, which is home to landmarks like the Bagdad Cafe, famous from the 1980s cult film.</p>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza are voicing increasing distrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure their release. Campaigners and relatives feel the government is not prioritizing a deal, pointing to the insistence on maintaining military positions and the influence of far-right coalition members who they believe value land over human life. Many now place more hope in the U.S. administration to pressure Israel into an agreement. This sentiment is fueled by the painful reality that some hostages, who could have been released in previous deals, have since been killed in captivity.</p>
