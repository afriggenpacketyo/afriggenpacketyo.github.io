          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese hospitals are still maintaining strict visitation restrictions, causing distress for families wanting to see hospitalized loved ones. Physicians and social workers are calling for these restrictions to be abolished or significantly reduced, arguing they violate human rights. While the health ministry recommends considering visitation opportunities, specific policies are left to individual facilities, resulting in inconsistent and often overly restrictive rules. Some doctors argue there's no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these restrictions in preventing infection spread, emphasizing the importance of patients' rights to see their families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports reveals that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently transfer their anxiety to their canine companions. The research found that dogs belonging to owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that employed dog owners may benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was wrongly deported to Mexico, despite his fear of harm there. The man, who is gay, had been protected from deportation to Guatemala, but was instead sent to Mexico. The judge criticized the administration's actions, stating that the deportation lacked due process. The ruling is one of several against the Trump administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is implementing new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, citing national security concerns. The new policies limit access for credentialed media to many areas of the Pentagon without an approved government escort. The Pentagon Press Association has expressed deep concern, calling the memo a direct attack on the freedom of the press. The National Press Club is urging the Pentagon to reverse course, arguing that restricting access undermines public trust.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has pledged to reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. The party aims to fund these policies by cutting net zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement follows pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer from Labour MPs to address both policies. The commitments will be unveiled at a press conference next week, highlighting policy divisions within the Labour party.</p>

          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, significantly less than the 1,400 needed for full staffing. Despite the shortage, the number is higher than last year, and city officials anticipate staffing to increase as students finish school. The city is offering incentives like increased hourly wages and signing bonuses to attract lifeguards. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards, though some have become accustomed to being more cautious due to the shortage.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine conducted another prisoner exchange, releasing hundreds of soldiers on both sides, even as airstrikes on Kyiv continued. Each side brought home 307 soldiers, a day after each released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. The swaps are seen as a moment of cooperation in otherwise failed efforts to reach a ceasefire in the three-year war. The news of the prisoner swap came hours after Kyiv came under an attack that left at least 15 people injured, local officials said.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," passed away at the age of 90. Her book, published in 1975, redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, significantly influencing societal attitudes and legal reforms. The book faced criticism for its assertions about men and its views on young women and personal responsibility. Brownmiller's work also included activism against pornography and explorations of femininity and the Vietnam War.</p>
