          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Emil Bove's nomination for a federal judgeship despite strong opposition. Democrats walked out of the meeting in protest, accusing Republicans of rushing the process and ignoring whistleblower allegations of unethical conduct against Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump. Bove's confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain, as his nomination is shadowed by controversy from his time at the Justice Department.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Significant Wage Gap for Migrants in Germany Persists Across Generations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than their native-born counterparts, a gap that shrinks but doesn't disappear in the second generation. Researchers attribute this disparity not to unequal pay for the same job, but to structural barriers limiting migrant access to higher-paying industries and roles. The report suggests that improved language support and recognition of foreign qualifications are key to addressing these structural issues and fostering better economic integration.</p>

          <p>Following a claim by Donald Trump that he persuaded Coca-Cola to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in the U.S., shares of producer ADM fell. Coca-Cola issued a noncommittal response, appreciating Trump's enthusiasm but not confirming a change, later defending the safety and composition of corn syrup. The Corn Refiners Association warned the move could cost American jobs, highlighting the complex interplay between political statements, corporate strategy, and agricultural economics.

          <p>Former chairs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are raising alarms over the Trump administration's executive orders aimed at quadrupling nuclear power by 2050. They argue that the push to slash regulations and expedite plant approvals threatens the NRC's independence, which is crucial for public safety. Citing the Fukushima disaster as a cautionary tale of regulatory capture, the former officials warn that prioritizing speed over safety could lead to grave mistakes and undermine public confidence in nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>China has launched a sophisticated "mini-brain" organoid to its Tiangong space station to investigate the effects of microgravity on the human mind. This advanced model, grown from living human tissue, includes nerve and immune cells and a structure mimicking the blood-brain barrier. Researchers hope this experiment will provide more human-like data than previous studies, offering powerful new insights for space medicine, neuroscience, and the development of drugs for neurological disorders.</p>

          <p>The Iranian government has dramatically increased the deportation of Afghan migrants, expelling hundreds of thousands in recent months and over 1.4 million since January. Authorities are using the unsubstantiated claim that Afghans assisted in recent Israeli military operations as a pretext, though anti-immigrant sentiment has been rising for years. The policy is creating a humanitarian crisis at the border and is particularly devastating for Afghan women and girls, who are being forced back to life under the Taliban's oppressive rule.</p>
