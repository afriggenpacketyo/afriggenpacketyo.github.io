          <p>North Carolina has been named America's Top State for Business for 2025, praised for its robust economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly policies that attract major investments from companies like Amazon and JetZero. The state's success is attributed to bipartisan support for pro-business initiatives, including low corporate taxes and a strong pipeline of educated workers. However, the article also highlights significant challenges, such as a low ranking for quality of life, minimal worker protections, and potential economic headwinds from federal policy changes and hurricane recovery costs.</p>

          <p>Following former President Trump's comments on Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article explains the deep historical ties between the United States and Liberia. The West African nation was founded in the 19th century by freed African-American slaves, which is why English is its official language and many cultural aspects, including its flag and capital city's name, reflect a strong American influence. This shared heritage accounts for the American-style accent that Trump likely noticed during their interaction, providing important context to his remarks.</p>

          <p>The Italian food conglomerate Ferrero Group has announced its intention to purchase WK Kellogg Co. for $3.1 billion, a strategic move to expand its global presence. WK Kellogg is known for iconic cereal brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops, which will now join Ferrero's portfolio of products like Nutella and Rocher chocolates. This acquisition follows Kellogg's 2023 decision to spin off its snack brands into a separate company, Kellanova, which was subsequently acquired by Mars.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has proposed restricting access to disability and sickness benefits to British citizens only, calling the current welfare bill a "ticking time bomb" for the economy. The plan aims to require individuals to have paid into the system and acquired citizenship before becoming eligible for such support. The proposal has drawn criticism from the Labour party, which argues the Conservatives failed to reform the system during their 14 years in power and warns of potential reciprocal actions against British citizens abroad.</p>

          <p>Police in Belfast have declared a major incident over a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, following a request from the city council to dismantle it. Authorities have raised serious concerns that the structure's proximity to a major electricity substation poses a risk to the power supply for two major hospitals, and that asbestos is present at the site. The situation has escalated tensions, with bonfire builders and loyalist activists opposing the removal, viewing it as an attack on their culture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel without pay for periods ranging from 10 to 42 days following the security failures during the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. The agency stated it is focused on fixing the root causes of the operational breakdown, such as inadequate training and coordination, rather than simply firing individuals. This disciplinary action comes after a bipartisan House report found that the tragic and preventable incident stemmed from preexisting systemic issues within the agency.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old hiker from Texas has died on the South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon, prompting renewed warnings from the National Park Service about extremely hazardous heat. The man was attempting a multi-day hike to the Colorado River when he became unresponsive. Park officials are advising against hiking the inner canyon trails between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., as temperatures at the canyon floor can soar above 120 degrees Fahrenheit, creating life-threatening conditions for even experienced hikers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deep-dive by the Los Angeles Times argues that the city's severe homelessness crisis is not an inevitable social problem but the direct result of a century of specific policy failures. The article traces the issue back to decisions such as halting public housing construction in the 1950s, demolishing thousands of single-room occupancy hotels, and implementing slow-growth policies that slashed the city's housing capacity. These factors, combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs and soaring housing costs, created a systemic shortage of affordable housing that underpins the modern crisis.</p>

These photos serve as a powerful and visceral public record of nuclear power from an era before the Limited Test Ban Treaty moved such detonations underground and out of sight.</p>
