          <p>Alexi Saenz, the leader of a Long Island-based MS-13 clique, is set for sentencing after pleading guilty to a federal racketeering case that includes his involvement in eight murders. The case gained national attention, particularly for the 2016 killings of two high school students, which prompted calls for the death penalty from then-President Trump. Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year sentence, citing Saenz's "senseless" crimes, while his defense argues for 45 years, pointing to his remorse, intellectual disabilities, and traumatic upbringing as mitigating factors.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a pause on certain weapons deliveries to Ukraine, citing a need to prioritize "America's interests" following a Department of Defense review of military support. This decision has caused concern in Kyiv, with officials warning that any delay in aid could embolden Russia and hinder Ukraine's defensive capabilities, especially its air defense systems. While US officials have not specified which shipments are affected, the move is reportedly based on concerns about dwindling US military stockpiles, a point the Kremlin has welcomed as a step toward ending the conflict.</p>

The initiative, described as "America First," aims to ensure that American contributions abroad are clearly and consistently identified, replacing a variety of disparate logos previously in use. This visual overhaul is part of a larger restructuring of the agency under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which includes absorbing the foreign aid agency USAID and streamlining operations to better reflect American diplomatic and public diplomacy goals.</p>

The personnel claim their illnesses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes from helicopters such as the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook. Although the MoD has not admitted liability, it has provided out-of-court settlements in at least six cases and is now conducting tests on aircraft emissions. Veterans' groups are urging the MoD to implement screening programs and raise awareness for those potentially affected.</p>

In a new report, researchers argue that mainstream metrics have "systematically underestimated" the country's actual consumption level. While unadjusted data shows China's per capita spending is a fraction of that in developed nations, the think tank contends that when properly assessed, its real consumption power may have already surpassed Mexico's and reached up to 50% of levels in countries like Japan and Germany, offering a new perspective on the economy's potential.

However, the current situation presents an ironic twist: Canada's resistance to an illiberal US administration is being led by its Liberal Party, rallying around a modern national identity defined by tolerance and multiculturalism, which Grant might have seen as an American import.</p>

          <p>An intense heatwave sweeping across Europe has turned deadly, with authorities reporting two heat-related fatalities in France and the discovery of two bodies by firefighters in Spain's Catalonia region. The extreme temperatures, which made June the hottest on record for both Spain and England, are also causing widespread disruption, including wildfires in Spain and power outages in Italian cities like Florence and Bergamo due to overheating electrical cables. The UN's weather agency has stated that such extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense as a direct result of human-induced climate change.</p>

          <p>Police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have arrested two people after discovering 383 corpses improperly piled up in a private crematorium. Officials attributed the grisly find to negligence, stating the bodies had been accepted by the facility but never cremated, with some potentially having been there for up to two years. Instead of ashes, families were reportedly given other materials. The state attorney general has promised a thorough investigation and the highest possible penalty for those responsible, as this event highlights the ongoing crisis in Mexico's overwhelmed forensic system.</p>

To secure a conviction, prosecutors must prove that Combs directed a criminal enterprise, using his network of associates to commit crimes like sex trafficking and obstruction of justice over several years. The defense argues that staff members were not knowingly complicit in the alleged "freak-offs," which were prolonged sexual encounters central to the prosecution's case.

Experts advise creating a detailed retirement budget to understand future spending and eliminating high-interest, non-mortgage debt to free up income. Securing a comprehensive healthcare plan is also vital to prepare for unexpected medical costs, a major source of debt for seniors. Additionally, creating an estate plan, developing a social and mental plan to combat post-career boredom, and conducting a lifestyle trial run can help ensure a smooth and fulfilling transition.

A justice select committee cited the CCRC's "inability to learn from its own mistakes" under Kneller's leadership.

          <p>Scientists believe they have solved the puzzle of why Earth remained lethally hot for 5 million years after the "Great Dying" mass extinction 252 million years ago. By analyzing a vast fossil archive from China, researchers concluded that the collapse of global tropical forests was a critical tipping point. The loss of this vegetation severely diminished the planet's ability to absorb and store carbon through processes like silicate weathering, causing atmospheric carbon to remain at extreme levels long after the initial volcanic activity ceased, offering a stark warning for today's climate change.</p>
