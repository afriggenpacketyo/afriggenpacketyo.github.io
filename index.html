He also commented on New York City politics, expressing opposition to the mayoral candidacy of Zohran Mamdani, whom he characterized as having the wrong policies to solve the city's problems despite accurately identifying them.

          <p>A third survivor has resigned from the panel of a UK inquiry into grooming gangs, intensifying criticism that the investigation is becoming chaotic. The departing members expressed concerns that potential chairs with backgrounds in policing or social work represent a conflict of interest, as those systems failed victims. In her resignation letter, one survivor stated the situation feels like a "cover-up of a cover-up," creating a toxic environment and downplaying the motivations behind the abuse, further undermining faith in the process.</p>

          <p>The United States and Australia have formalized an $8.5 billion framework deal to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to lessen dependence on China. The agreement will mobilize financing for mining and processing projects in both nations, with a goal of generating end products for American and Australian buyers. Analysts suggest that while this is a significant step, developing a fully independent and secure supply chain outside of China's market dominance could take between 10 and 20 years.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a series of reforms aimed at cutting red tape to foster business growth, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually. The plan includes simplifying the corporate merger process and eliminating lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. While business groups like the British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the initiative, others, such as the Federation of Small Businesses, remain skeptical, stating the true test will be whether the government avoids raising employer taxes in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering competitive returns that can help savers protect their money's buying power against inflation. The article notes that online banks typically provide higher rates than traditional institutions due to lower overhead costs. It also highlights the current inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs of around six months to one year often feature higher annual percentage yields (APYs) than longer-term CDs, presenting a unique opportunity for savers.

          <p>Several states are warning that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits for over 40 million Americans could be disrupted in November if the federal government shutdown continues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has informed states that there will be insufficient funds for full benefits if the funding lapse persists and has instructed them to pause payment processing. While the USDA has contingency funds, it is unclear if they will be used, leaving millions of low-income individuals and families facing uncertainty about their food security.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent public appearances, marked by confusing statements and rambling tangents, have renewed questions about his fitness for office and the mechanisms for removing an impaired president. While Republicans have largely ignored these episodes, some critics have called for invoking the 25th Amendment. However, legal experts explain that Section 4 of the amendment, designed for a president who is unable to function, sets an extremely high bar for removal, requiring support from the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet, followed by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress if the president contests it.</p>

          <p>Gavin Plumb, a security guard convicted of soliciting the murder and inciting the kidnap and sexual assault of presenter Holly Willoughby, has had his appeal dismissed. The Court of Appeal upheld his life sentence with a 16-year minimum term, ruling that he intended harm "of the gravest and highest possible kind." The plot was uncovered when Plumb was caught by an undercover US police officer in an online group, leading to his arrest and the discovery of a "kidnap kit" in his home.</p>

          <p>In southwest Madagascar, a novel conservation project is attempting to restore collapsing fisheries by building artificial coral reefs rather than restricting fishing access. This approach acknowledges that traditional conservation often fails in impoverished nations where communities depend on natural resources for survival. By creating new habitats for fish, the project aims to improve food security and livelihoods for local villagers, treating conservation as a byproduct of a human-centered public health and economic intervention in a region beset by overfishing and poverty.</p>

While the impacts in the UK may not be severe enough for the system to be named by the Met Office, meteorological agencies in France or Belgium could name it Storm Benjamin if it intensifies as it moves across the continent.</p>
