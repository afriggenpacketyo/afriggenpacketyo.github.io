          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced sharp criticism from Democratic senators during a congressional hearing where he reiterated unsubstantiated claims about vaccine safety. Kennedy endorsed a panelist's statement that mRNA vaccines cause "serious harm" and clashed with lawmakers over whether his new policies are restricting public access to COVID-19 shots. The tense exchange follows significant leadership changes at the CDC and accusations that the administration is deliberately weakening the nation's public health system. Kennedy defended his actions, claiming he was removing conflicts of interest and not limiting vaccine availability.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Angela Rayner as Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary is a significant blow to both her career and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government just 14 months into its term. The departure raises numerous questions about the future of the Labour Party's leadership and policy direction, including who will replace her and whether the government can still deliver on its ambitious housebuilding commitments. This unexpected event disrupts the intended start of the government's "phase two" agenda. The political fallout and its impact on the government's popularity will unfold in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday as investors awaited the release of the U.S. August jobs report, which is expected to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on a potential interest rate cut in September. The Stoxx 600 index saw gains, led by mining stocks, reflecting a brighter market sentiment after a week of sell-offs. Meanwhile, Danish wind energy company Orsted experienced volatile trading after securing shareholder approval for a major rights issue amidst ongoing legal battles with the Trump administration over offshore wind projects. Market analysts are watching for a jobs report that signals economic softness without indicating a severe downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities conducted a major raid on a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia, resulting in the arrest of more than 450 people for alleged "unlawful employment practices." The operation, which involved multiple federal agencies including ICE, has drawn a strong reaction from the South Korean foreign ministry, which called the detention of its nationals an "unjust infringement" of their rights. The raid targeted a facility that had been hailed as a major economic development project for the state.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has suspended production at its UK factories and instructed staff to stay home after a significant cyber attack forced the company to take its IT systems offline. The disruption has halted manufacturing at plants in Halewood, Solihull, and Wolverhampton, and has also heavily impacted vehicle sales during a popular time for new car registrations. The attack's effects are cascading through the supply chain, forcing parts suppliers to restrict operations and causing potential delays for existing customers needing repairs. The company is working to restore its complex systems, but the full duration of the shutdown remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that faulty diagnostic machines used in 16 NHS hospital trusts in England have produced inaccurate diabetes test results, affecting at least 55,000 patients who now require re-testing. The errors, linked to machines from manufacturer Trinity Biotech, have led to some individuals being wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed unnecessary medication. NHS England confirmed the issue, which was first reported in April 2024, and stated that all affected laboratories have since replaced the machines or corrected calibration issues. Patients who require a new test are being contacted by their local health providers.</p>

The proposal, which follows a Delaware court's rejection of his 2018 pay package, would grant Musk additional shares in 12 tranches, significantly increasing his voting control over the company. The plan is designed to keep Musk motivated, with the first award contingent on Tesla's market cap nearly doubling to $2 trillion.

          <p>A forecasting tournament designed to test predictions about artificial intelligence found that both domain experts and generalist "superforecasters" significantly underestimated the pace of AI advancement over the last three years. The study, conducted by the Forecasting Research Institute, revealed that actual AI performance on several benchmarks far outpaced the 2022 predictions from both groups, though experts were slightly closer to the mark. For example, an AI achieved a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad a decade earlier than forecasters predicted. The results suggest that predicting AI's trajectory is exceptionally difficult, with the most reliable method being the aggregation of all forecasts.</p>

          <p>The Duchess of Kent, who has died at 92, led a life marked by a quiet withdrawal from traditional royal duties in favor of her passions for music and children. Best known publicly for presenting Wimbledon trophies, she made the surprising decision to become a music teacher at a primary school in Hull, where she was known simply as "Kath." Born Katharine Worsley, she married Prince Edward in 1961 and navigated the pressures of royal life while dealing with personal tragedy and health struggles. Her conversion to Catholicism in 1994 was a notable moment, but her legacy is equally defined by her choice to lead a more private, purpose-driven life.</p>

Married to the late Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, Prince Edward, she was known for her compassion, famously consoling a tearful Jana Novotná at Wimbledon in 1993. A great music lover, the Duchess quietly stepped back from many royal duties to work as a music teacher at a primary school in Hull, where she was known simply as "Mrs Kent." She was also the first member of the senior Royal Family to publicly convert to Roman Catholicism since the 17th century.</p>

This move, part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to boost sales, reverses previous trends of removing seats and outlets.

By designating Latin American criminal groups like Tren de Aragua as terrorist organizations, the Trump administration has created a legal framework to use deadly military force against them. This approach, long hinted at by the President, raises complex legal questions and suggests a more militarized foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.

          <p>Researchers have determined that solar flares, the powerful eruptions from the sun's surface, can reach temperatures of up to 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, which is more than six times hotter than prior estimates. A new report explains that previous measurements focused only on the temperature of electrons, assuming that ions would be the same. However, recent simulations and calculations show that ions within the flares heat up significantly more than electrons. This finding could lead to a better understanding of how solar flares work and help improve protections for satellites and astronauts from these dangerous solar events.</p>

          <p>This article presents evidence arguing that the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority consistently manipulates legal procedures and precedents to favor former President Donald Trump and his administration. The analysis points to the Court's frequent granting of emergency requests from the Trump administration, the creation of new legal doctrines like the "major questions doctrine" applied only to the Biden administration, and decisions that seem to ignore facts to rule in favor of conservative religious litigants. The author contends that this pattern of behavior, which they label "Calvinball jurisprudence," suggests the justices are acting as partisans rather than impartial arbiters of the law.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, exceeding analysts' expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The increase was largely driven by strong sales in clothing, footwear, and online retail, attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. The release of the data was delayed by two weeks due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS apologized. Despite the monthly rise, the broader trend shows a 0.6% decline in sales volumes in the three months leading up to July compared to the previous quarter.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States is prepared to "blow up" foreign criminal organizations if necessary, potentially with the cooperation of allied nations. His comments, made during a visit to Ecuador, followed a recent U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean that the White House said killed 11 drug traffickers. Rubio also announced the designation of two major Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations, a move that allows for sanctions and expanded intelligence sharing. The statement signals an increasingly aggressive and militarized U.S. stance against international crime.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating between Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu and the Trump administration over the city's "sanctuary" policies, with reports suggesting a major federal immigration enforcement operation is being planned for the area. Mayor Wu has strongly defended Boston's laws that limit local police cooperation with ICE, arguing they enhance public safety by building community trust. In response, administration officials have vowed to "flood the zone" with more agents in sanctuary jurisdictions. Wu stated that her administration is preparing for the possibility of a National Guard deployment, similar to actions recently taken in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are initiating an investigation into the recent firings of at least 20 Justice Department employees, including staff who worked on Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into former President Trump. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the senators demand records and justification for the terminations, which they describe as a "petty but pernicious abuse of power." Those dismissed reportedly include not only prosecutors but also paralegals, administrative staff, and U.S. Marshals. The senators allege the firings were politically motivated, antidemocratic, and likely unlawful, targeting career public servants without cause.</p>

Speaking in Beijing, Deripaska noted that Chinese banks' heavy dependence on U.S. dollar assets and their risk aversion have been a source of frustration for Moscow. He urged China to accelerate the expansion of a yuan-based global debt market to increase the currency's use in international financial settlements, arguing it is a necessary step for the country to become a true global power.</p>

          <p>Dozens of residents from the Olive Dell Ranch, a nudist community in Southern California, have filed a lawsuit against the property's new owners, alleging a campaign of neglect and harassment designed to force them out. The lawsuit claims that since the new ownership took a more active role, essential services like trash collection and pool maintenance have ceased, and a new mandatory clothing rule was implemented. The 56 plaintiffs, many of whom are elderly or disabled, are seeking at least $5 million in damages, alleging civil rights violations, elder abuse, and breach of contract in an attempt to rebrand the property and raise rents.</p>

          <p>A new technology called BurnBot, a large remote-controlled vehicle that incinerates flammable vegetation, is being demonstrated as a potential weapon against wildfires in Southern California. The machine, likened to a "Roomba for the forest," can perform highly controlled burns with precision, allowing it to clear flammable brush near homes and highways even during peak fire season with minimal risk. Wildfire officials are observing the technology as an innovative alternative to traditional methods like mowing or prescribed burns, which have limitations. BurnBot aims to reduce human-caused ignitions and create strategic fuel breaks to slow the spread of future fires.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, on September 6, 1995, Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's long-standing record by playing in his 2,131st consecutive baseball game. The moment became iconic not just for the record itself, but for the spontaneous 22-minute victory lap Ripken took around Camden Yards, shaking hands with fans, opponents, and officials. This display of class and connection with the public is credited with helping to revitalize baseball's image and win back fans who were alienated by the 1994 players' strike. The streak, which ultimately reached 2,632 games, cemented Ripken's legacy as baseball's "Iron Man" and a symbol of dedication.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to create a massive housing center for veterans in West Los Angeles is being developed in secrecy, alarming advocates and congressional members. The Department of Veterans Affairs has required all involved parties to sign non-disclosure agreements, preventing review of the plan, which aims to house up to 6,000 veterans. At a recent roundtable, veterans and lawmakers expressed frustration over the lack of transparency, fearing that a plan developed without community input will fail to meet the diverse needs of the veteran population. Questions also remain about the project's funding and the type of housing that will be provided.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes the Trump administration for attempting to rewrite American history, specifically highlighting a White House complaint about a Smithsonian exhibit describing 19th-century "Californios" losing land to Anglo "squatters." The author argues that this is part of a broader effort to create a triumphalist narrative of U.S. history that minimizes or erases the injustices faced by non-white groups. The piece asserts that the loss of land by Californios is a well-documented historical fact, not a partisan viewpoint, and calls on Californians to resist efforts to sanitize the state's complex and often tragic past.</p>

          <p>Americans are expressing growing anger and confusion over the difficulty of obtaining COVID-19 vaccines this fall, a situation resulting from new Trump administration policies. The Department of Health and Human Services, led by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has introduced new hurdles, requiring many adults under 65 to consult a healthcare professional or attest to an underlying condition to get a shot. This has created a confusing patchwork of rules that vary by state and pharmacy, leading to delays and denials even as a late summer COVID wave spreads. Health experts warn these barriers will inevitably lead to lower vaccination rates and more severe illness.</p>

          <p>A new, rigorous clinical study has found that a single high dose of LSD can significantly reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for up to 12 weeks. The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved nearly 200 adults and showed that those who received 100 or 200 micrograms of the substance experienced rapid and sustained improvements compared to those on a placebo or lower doses. The proprietary form of LSD, known as MM120, has been granted "breakthrough therapy" status by the FDA, potentially speeding up its approval process as a revolutionary treatment for psychiatric conditions.</p>
