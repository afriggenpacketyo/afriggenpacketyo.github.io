          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her experiences navigating Washington D.C.'s political landscape in her new memoir, "Far from Home." Murkowski, a third-generation Alaskan, emphasizes her commitment to her constituents and her independent approach to politics, noting that she was re-elected through the support of Alaskans across party lines after losing in the Republican primary. She highlights her dedication to representing the diverse needs of her state and expresses concern over Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, regardless of the president's party. She stresses the importance of maintaining relationships to effectively serve Alaska, even with those she disagrees with. The senator did not vote for Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarifies the United States' position following airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, asserting that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not Iran itself. Vance stated that the strikes substantially set back Iran's nuclear ambitions, potentially delaying their ability to develop nuclear weapons for years, while not directly confirming the complete destruction of all facilities. He mentioned the administration's plan to address Iran's enriched uranium stockpile and warned that any Iranian retaliation would be met with "overwhelming force." Vance emphasized that the Trump administration is focused on eliminating Iran's nuclear program, not pursuing regime change.</p>

The election results are viewed as a reflection of voter sentiment on national issues, including inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies.

          <p>Following US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran is deliberating its response, considering options ranging from immediate retaliation to delayed action or non-retaliation. Internal debates are occurring amidst heightened security concerns and fears of further Israeli targeting or betrayal. The potential for escalation carries significant risks for Iran and the region, with discussions focusing on the survival of the Islamic Republic regime. Options include direct attacks on US interests in the Middle East, utilizing proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, or employing cyber warfare. Ultimately, Iran's decision will be influenced by the desire to protect its regime while responding to the perceived aggression.</p>

          <p>Bimco, the largest global shipowners organization, warns of heightened risks to commercial shipping in the Arabian Peninsula following the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The organization anticipates potential disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil chokepoint, through attacks on merchant ships or the laying of sea mines, while it is expected that U.S. warships and merchant ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. would be the preferred targets for the Iranians. Ocean freight rates have already surged, particularly from Shanghai to Jebel Ali, and spot rates for VLCC voyages between the Middle East and China have increased significantly. Integrated logistics provider Maersk announced Friday it is temporarily suspending port calls to Israel's largest container port, Haifa.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran "reserves all options to defend its security interests and people" following U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities. He condemned the American operation as an "outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation" of the United Nations Charter and international law. Iran's ambassador to the U.N. requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council to address the attacks. Meanwhile, the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iranian nuclear officials stated there was no spike in off-site radiation levels following the U.S. strikes.</p>

Yastremska fought back in the second set, saving multiple match points, but Kessler regained her composure to secure the victory. The achievement is notable for Kessler, as she had only recently recorded her first career grass-court win at Queen's.</p>

          <p>The author argues that President Trump's decision to bomb nuclear sites in Iran without congressional approval undermines American democracy. They contend that the Constitution assigns the war power to Congress, and bypassing Congress deprives Americans of representation and the ability to hold their representatives accountable. The author compares the situation to the 2002 authorization for the Iraq War, highlighting the importance of debate, education, and accountability. The author concludes that the trend of denying the public democratic channels to oppose war is dangerous and can lead to radicalization.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, identifies five common phrases that can make children resistant to listening and suggests alternative approaches to foster cooperation. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Raouda argues that these phrases trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while alternatives that respect a child's autonomy and acknowledge their feelings promote a more positive and collaborative dynamic. She emphasizes that the key to getting kids to listen is creating conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there due to "armed conflict, terrorism and civil unrest."

          <p>Recent acts of politically motivated violence in the U.S. have sparked fears of a new era of political violence. Multiple incidents, including an attack on Democratic legislators in Minnesota and violence during "No Kings" demonstrations, have raised concerns. Experts point to a historically high period of American political violence, with rising support for the use of force to achieve political means. The Israel-Gaza war has also contributed to the tension, with acts of violence committed in solidarity with Palestinians. While violence has been committed by both sides, some argue that Republican political leaders bear more culpability for the current climate.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are accused of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters in the Tampa Bay area, according to a court hearing. The ACLU argues that the redrawn districts artificially whiten the electorate by separating Black voters across a 10-mile waterway. The case highlights previous efforts by Republican officials in Florida to manipulate voting districts to their advantage. The three judges will give their ruling at a later date on whether the Republican-held senateâ€™s 2022 redistricting process was unconstitutional.</p>

He echoed President Trump's warning to Iran, stating that any targeting of Americans would be met with a response far greater than the recent strikes. While the full damage assessment is still underway, Cotton asserts that the strikes have severely damaged Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure. He emphasizes that the U.S. is not pursuing regime change in Iran, but rather aiming to eliminate their nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>The shooting of an Indiana kidney doctor has prompted discussions about vigilante violence and the shortcomings of the American healthcare system. The case has drawn parallels to a previous incident involving UnitedHealthcare, sparking concerns about the rise of for-profit dialysis clinics and their impact on patient care. The author of "How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine" says the incident conjures many of the same complex swirl of emotions that Americans expressed after the UnitedHealthcare shooting. The prosecutor voiced a broader concern about what he said he fears is a growing wave of disturbing vigilante violence that has no place in a civilized society.</p>
