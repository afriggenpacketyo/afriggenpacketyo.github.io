          <p>President Donald Trump has stated it is "highly unlikely" he would dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite his ongoing public criticism of Powell's performance. This comment came shortly after reports that Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Powell with Republican lawmakers, which caused instability in stock markets. While continuing to assert that Powell is "doing a lousy job" by not lowering interest rates, Trump clarified that a dismissal would only be considered in an extreme case, such as fraud.

          <p>U.S. Central Command announced that its Yemeni partners have intercepted a massive shipment of Iranian weapons intended for Houthi rebels. The seizure, described as the largest in the history of the Yemeni National Resistance Forces, included over 750 tons of munitions such as advanced missiles, drone components, and radar systems. CENTCOM commander Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla stated that the interdiction highlights Iran's role as a destabilizing force in the region and is crucial for maintaining regional security and freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review led by Lord David Anderson KC has determined that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism scheme failed to act on multiple warnings about Axel Rudakubana, the individual responsible for the deadly Southport knife attack. Despite teachers referring him three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was repeatedly closed because he lacked a clear terrorist ideology. The report calls for Prevent to broaden its scope to include individuals fascinated with extreme violence, even without a specific ideological motive, to potentially avert future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has suspended four of its Members of Parliament after they rebelled against the party's position on a government welfare bill. The MPs were part of a larger group of 47 who voted against proposed welfare cuts, forcing the government to amend its plans. The suspended MPs, including Rachael Maskell, stated they were acting in the best interests of their constituents and could not support measures that would make disabled people and others poorer. This disciplinary action occurs at a time when party leader Keir Starmer's authority is being tested.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report reflects on the unusual 2007 case of Linda Duffey, who admitted to fatally shooting her husband but claimed it was an accident that occurred while she was mimicking a Bugs Bunny cartoon. This bizarre explanation, dubbed the "Bugs Bunny Defense," created significant division among law enforcement officials even before it reached a courtroom. The case is notable not just for its cartoon-related premise but also for the unexpected twists that unfolded, offering lessons about the workings of the justice system in highly unusual circumstances.</p>

          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing in action during World War II, has been reunited with his personalized Zippo lighter after 80 years. The reunion was made possible after a relative saw the lighter, inscribed with Musashe's name, in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector. With assistance from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the family contacted the collector, who willingly returned the artifact. The airman's 95-year-old sister, who last saw him as a child, was able to hold the lighter, bringing a tangible piece of her brother's memory home.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment giant ASML dropped by 11.4% after the company expressed uncertainty about its growth prospects for 2026. Despite beating revenue and profit expectations for the second quarter, ASML's guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short of analyst forecasts. CEO Christophe Fouquet stated that while fundamentals for its AI-related customers remain strong, increasing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty prevents the company from confirming growth for 2026 at this time. ASML is a critical supplier, producing the advanced lithography machines necessary for manufacturing the world's most sophisticated chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the suspension for former Dodgers pitcher Julio Urías concludes, his agent, Scott Boras, has stated that Urías fully intends to resume his baseball career. Urías became the first player to be suspended twice under MLB's policy on domestic violence and sexual assault, following a 2023 incident. Once he is removed from the restricted list, any team will be eligible to sign him. Boras noted that Urías is currently getting back into shape and will have options available, though the level of team interest and the timeline for a potential return to a major league mound remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a powerful performance from its trading division. The bank's trading operations generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. This success reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where market volatility from U.S. tariff policies has created profitable conditions for trading desks. Investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% increase, contributing to the firm's overall strong quarterly results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, ProPublica climate reporter Abrahm Lustgarten characterized the recent severe floods in Texas as a significant "early warning" of the chaotic climate future. He expressed deep concern over the combination of increasingly common extreme weather events with political decisions that undermine science and cut funding for key agencies like FEMA and NOAA. Lustgarten argues that this confluence of factors, where disaster frequency is rising while preparedness and scientific infrastructure are being weakened, should be "extraordinarily concerning" for the public and policymakers alike.</p>

          <p>A report from Deutsche Welle explores the possibility that First Lady Melania Trump is playing a role in shaping President Donald Trump's policy toward Ukraine. The President recently revealed that his wife often points out the contradiction between his "nice" phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. This has led to a flurry of positive social media activity from Ukrainians, who have dubbed her "Agent Melania Trumpenko." The article notes that her upbringing in the former Yugoslavia may give her a unique perspective on the region's geopolitics.</p>

It recounts key moments, including Epstein's death, Trump's shifting statements on declassifying files, and the Justice Department's recent announcement that no client list exists. The timeline culminates in the recent backlash from right-wing commentators and Trump supporters, who feel betrayed by the administration's handling of the case, and Trump's subsequent pleas for them to move on from what he now calls a "hoax."</p>

          <p>President Trump has forcefully pushed back against the controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, labeling it a "Hoax" and "bulls***." In a social media post, he criticized his own supporters who have bought into the issue, calling them "weaklings" and stating he no longer wants their support. This outburst highlights a significant rift within his party, as prominent conservatives and Republicans continue to call for more transparency from the Justice Department regarding the investigation into the deceased sex offender. The President has defended Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>An NHS Fife nurse, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct allegations that arose after she complained about sharing a female changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended last year and faced accusations including misgendering her colleague, Dr. Beth Upton. An internal NHS hearing found insufficient evidence to support a finding of misconduct. The decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Peggie claims unlawful discrimination, resumed. The case has become a focal point in the broader UK debate over transgender rights and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>Republican senators have indicated they will amend a spending cut package to protect funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The move would spare the globally recognized HIV/AIDS program from a proposed $400 million cut, leaving the total rescissions package at $9 billion. The original bill, which targets foreign aid and public broadcasting, faced bipartisan opposition over the proposed cuts to PEPFAR, a program credited with saving millions of lives. The amendment means the revised bill must return to the House of Representatives for another vote.</p>
