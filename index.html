          <p>Emergency search operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, were suspended due to a new and severe flood threat. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning as heavy thunderstorms moved over the already saturated region, with the Guadalupe and San Saba rivers expected to rise dangerously. This development complicates the ongoing massive search for over 160 people still missing after the initial disaster, which has already claimed at least 129 lives statewide. Authorities have urged all crews and volunteers to evacuate the river corridors immediately.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures, expanding rapidly due to strong winds. The fire also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to evacuate and hindered containment efforts. This event is part of a worsening wildfire season, with another large, uncontained fire burning in Kaibab National Forest. Meanwhile, smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>A small, 12-meter aircraft crashed and caught fire shortly after takeoff at London Southend Airport on Sunday afternoon. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane bank sharply before it inverted and hit the ground, resulting in a large fireball. Emergency services responded immediately to the scene, and the airport confirmed that all four scheduled departures for the evening were cancelled due to the serious incident. The number of casualties or the status of the pilots has not yet been officially confirmed by authorities.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has launched a commission of inquiry and placed Police Minister Senzo Mchunu on leave following serious allegations of his links to criminal syndicates. The move comes after a top police commissioner publicly accused the minister of interfering with investigations into political killings and organized crime. The broad-ranging inquiry, led by the deputy chief justice, will investigate potential infiltration of the police and justice system by criminal elements. This action addresses growing public and political pressure for accountability amid concerns over national security and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service, the SBU, announced it has killed two suspected Russian agents who allegedly assassinated a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv last week. The daylight attack on Colonel Ivan Voronych was captured on surveillance video, and the suspects were reportedly killed after resisting arrest in the Kyiv region. Voronych was believed to be involved in covert operations within Russia-occupied territories. The incident highlights the ongoing shadow war of assassinations between the two nations, as both sides have targeted high-profile figures since the 2022 invasion.</p>

Described by Graham as a "sledgehammer," the legislation would give President Trump the authority to levy tariffs up to 500% on nations like China, India, and Brazil that purchase Russian goods, thereby funding the Kremlin's military. The push for stronger measures comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the conflict.

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin Monday, in hopes of reaching a trade agreement with the Trump administration. The decision came after President Trump declared new 30% tariffs on EU goods would start on August 1, citing a persistent trade deficit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the suspension of countermeasures provides a window for negotiations until the new U.S. deadline. EU trade ministers are meeting to discuss the path forward in the escalating trade dispute.</p>

          <h2>Government Data Shows Most ICE Detainees Have No Criminal Convictions, Contradicting Trump's Rhetoric</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's rhetoric about deporting "the worst of the worst," government data reveals that the majority of immigrants currently detained by ICE have no criminal record. As of late June, over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in ICE detention had no criminal convictions. Of those with a record, a small fraction were for high-level violent crimes, with most being for nonviolent offenses related to immigration or traffic. Critics argue there is a significant disconnect between the administration's claims of targeting dangerous criminals and the reality of who is being arrested and detained.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem clarified that President Trump's goal is to "remake" the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), rather than eliminate it entirely. Speaking amidst criticism of the federal response to the deadly Texas floods, Noem defended the administration, calling its handling of the crisis the "best response" in years. Her comments appear to soften previous rhetoric from both herself and the president about phasing out the agency. Critics, however, point to staff departures and budget issues as signs that FEMA's capacity to handle major disasters has been eroded under the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week, a meeting that comes as the administration plans to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine.

The meeting also occurs amid a strong bipartisan push in the U.S. Senate for new, sweeping sanctions against Russia and its economic partners. This signals a potential turning point in the U.S. and NATO's strategy to increase pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were waiting to collect water, according to emergency officials. The Israeli military acknowledged the incident, stating a "technical error" caused a munition targeting an Islamic Jihad militant to miss its mark by dozens of meters, and said the event is under review. The IDF expressed regret for any harm to civilians. The strike is part of an escalation of Israeli attacks across Gaza, and it has drawn further attention to the high civilian toll of the conflict, particularly around aid and resource distribution points.</p>

          <p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett has affirmed that President Trump's threatened tariffs on Mexico and the European Union will be implemented unless improved trade deals are reached.

European leaders are now scrambling to find a diplomatic solution before the deadline, while also preparing potential countermeasures.

However, a new FAA notification states the design is not considered an unsafe condition warranting a mandate, a position Boeing has echoed to its operators.</p>
