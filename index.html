        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details significant advancements in understanding and treating chronic pain. The article highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," where patient experiences guide lab-based studies, rather than the other way around. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of pain in the brain for the first time. This breakthrough has led to clinical trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for treatment, though the technology is not yet widely available.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis star Jelena Ostapenko has publicly apologized for comments made to American player Taylor Townsend following a U.S. Open match. After her 7-5, 6-1 loss, Ostapenko told Townsend she had "no education," sparking controversy. In her social media apology, Ostapenko explained that as a non-native English speaker, she was referring to tennis etiquette, not Townsend's general education, and acknowledged her words could be offensive. Townsend, who is Black, accepted the apology but noted the historical weight of such language, stating she hopes Ostapenko learns to focus on herself rather than trying to control others.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the world is entering a new, multipolar arms race that significantly heightens the danger posed by advanced ballistic missile capabilities. The author contends that, much like during the Cold War, adversarial nations can now hold populations hostage under the threat of nuclear annihilation, with the risk of accidental conflict being dangerously high. While acknowledging the nature of warfare has changed, the piece suggests the current trajectory towards perpetual conflict is reversible. It serves as a stark warning about the fragile state of the global strategic environment 80 years after the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>A powerful project by CBS News' Steve Hartman and photographer Lou Bopp documents the bedrooms of children killed in school shootings, left untouched by their grieving families. Over six years, they visited eight families who shared these deeply personal spaces, hoping the images convey their profound loss and motivate change. The photographs serve as portraits of the absent children, capturing their personalities through the small details they left behind. The project aims to combat the numbness that can accompany frequent news of such tragedies by presenting a tangible and heartbreaking reminder of the young lives that were cut short.</p>

          <p>This article examines the significant implications of President Donald Trump's efforts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, highlighted by his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook. While the administration portrays these actions as necessary reforms for an institution often blamed for inflation, experts warn it threatens the central bank's crucial political independence. Such a shift could politicize monetary policy, affecting interest rates, bank regulation, and the stability of the U.S. financial system.

          <p>A decade ago, the declining industrial town of Altena, Germany, volunteered to accept more migrants than required, hoping to reverse its economic and population downturn. While the initiative brought new life, filling empty housing and schools, it was not a simple solution. Many newcomers integrated successfully, contributing to the local economy with community support, but others struggled with language barriers or moved to larger cities for better opportunities. The town now faces rising welfare costs and growing support for the anti-immigration AfD party, reflecting a complex reality where migration has provided benefits but also created new challenges.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts by the Department of Justice has drawn criticism for what many see as a failure to press for key information. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but Deputy US Attorney Todd Blanche did not ask for names. Critics, including former federal prosecutors and attorneys for victims, argue that the questioning was superficial and allowed Maxwell to evade substantive answers. This has fueled speculation that the disclosures are more performative than a genuine effort for transparency, leaving crucial questions about Epstein's powerful network unanswered.</p>

          <p>In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—introduced surfing to the U.S. mainland in Santa Cruz, California. While studying at a nearby military school, they fashioned boards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport, an event documented by a local newspaper. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seeds for the sport's popularity, which would later be globalized by Duke Kahanamoku. A new museum exhibit in Santa Cruz highlights this pivotal moment, showcasing replicas of their massive, finless boards and celebrating the cultural exchange that brought the iconic sport to American shores.</p>

Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process.

The firing of key officials, including NLRB Chair Gwynne Wilcox, has left the agency without a quorum and unable to issue decisions, effectively rendering it powerless. This, combined with legal challenges from corporations like SpaceX questioning the NLRB's constitutionality, threatens to roll back worker protections to pre-1935 levels. Critics argue these moves elevate corporate interests over workers' rights and hobble the agency's ability to enforce labor laws and protect collective bargaining. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This essay addresses the common feeling of guilt associated with experiencing personal happiness while the world faces numerous crises. Drawing on ancient religious and philosophical traditions, the author argues that humanity is like a single body where if one part suffers, all suffer. However, this interconnectedness also means that if one part rejoices, all should rejoice as well. The piece advocates for embracing "sympathetic joy" alongside empathy for pain, suggesting that focusing solely on global suffering leads to cynicism. Feeling both the world's horror and its delight is presented as a natural and healthy part of being a connected human, and a form of resistance against despair.</p>

Critics fear his actions could dismantle the program, which provides a no-fault system for compensating rare vaccine injuries and shields manufacturers from most lawsuits. Undermining the VICP could destabilize the vaccine market, potentially leading manufacturers to exit and reducing vaccine availability. Experts suggest Kennedy could alter the program by making it easier to approve claims without scientific backing or by pushing to abolish it entirely, which would make it harder for genuinely injured individuals to receive compensation.</p>

          <p>The IRS has issued guidance clarifying how consumers can still qualify for the up to $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, even if they don't take possession of the car by the September 30 deadline. According to the new rules, a buyer can secure the credit by entering into a "written binding contract" and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before the deadline. This allows consumers to order a vehicle now and claim the credit when it is delivered later. This clarification provides a crucial window for buyers as the popular federal incentive is set to expire under a new tax and spending law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's high-profile crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., is facing significant setbacks in court, with federal prosecutors struggling to secure indictments. In the past month, grand juries have refused to indict in at least five cases involving alleged assaults on federal officers, including the widely publicized "Sandwich Guy" incident. Federal judges have also expressed frustration with sloppy casework and unnecessary delays, questioning the strength of the surge's arrests. This judicial resistance suggests that the administration's push to file harsh federal charges is colliding with the skepticism of both jurors and the judiciary in a city overwhelmingly opposed to the federal deployment.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the increasing use of the National Guard for roles like law enforcement, immigration control, and even as substitute teachers is a dangerous trend for American democracy. The author, a former Guard member, contends that such deployments blur the line between civilian and military roles, erode public trust, and hollow out civilian institutions by providing a temporary fix instead of addressing underlying social issues. This misuse not only casts soldiers as occupiers in their own communities but also degrades their readiness for their intended missions of disaster response and national defense. The article calls on governors to resist these deployments to preserve the Guard's essential purpose.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, which once championed the rapid development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines through Operation Warp Speed, is now actively dismantling that achievement. Led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, the administration is canceling grants for mRNA research, replacing expert advisory panels with critics, and removing recommendations for certain groups to get vaccinated. This reversal, which contradicts established scientific data on the vaccines' safety and efficacy, is making it harder for Americans to access the shots. The policy shift appears to be a politically motivated effort to appease a base that has grown hostile to pandemic-era policies.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to curb the trend, India continues to lead the world in deaths and injuries related to taking dangerous selfies, often called "killfies." Recent incidents include tourists being charged by elephants while attempting to take photos, and new surveys confirm India accounts for a disproportionate number of such accidents. The most common danger zones are heights like cliffs and waterfalls, and the majority of victims are men. Researchers note that one person's mistake can lead to wider tragedies, as others often die trying to rescue the initial victim. Psychologists attribute the phenomenon to the pursuit of online validation overriding personal judgment.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party, if elected, would eliminate all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. The plan aims to "maximise extraction" by removing mandates for emissions reduction and carbon capture technologies, which she described as a burden on producers. This policy marks a significant shift from the UK's legally binding 2050 net zero target and aligns with calls from Reform UK for more fossil fuel production. The current Labour government criticized the proposal, stating it would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills and reiterated its commitment to a fair transition away from oil and gas.</p>

          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha has created a supply bottleneck, causing prices to skyrocket and shortages even in its native Japan.

Japan's aging farming community is struggling to keep up with the labor-intensive process of growing tencha, the tea used for matcha. As a result, retailers are rationing supplies, and major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for the popular green powder.

While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels.

The author contends that the current political climate exhibits many fascist traits Morrison described, but warns against viewing it as a new phenomenon or one exclusive to a single political party. The article posits that Black history provides a powerful model for antifascist resistance through unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and profound faith. By celebrating Black culture, as Beyoncé does, and continuing the fight for justice, Americans can draw strength from a legacy of prevailing against seemingly impossible odds.</p>
