        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders to change their name back to the Redskins, a move he argues is widely desired. His stance received backing from HUD Secretary Scott Turner, a former player for the team, who agreed it was time to bring the name back. Trump also threatened to block a potential new stadium deal for the team in Washington, D.C., if the name change is not reversed. However, the team's current ownership has stated they are moving forward with the Commanders name and are not looking back.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns over looming trade tariffs, one market analyst argues that ten key factors are currently buoying the stock market. These include strong corporate earnings, the economic stimulus from the proposed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," and increased business spending incentives. Other positive drivers cited are the re-shoring of manufacturing, massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electrical grid, and a more favorable environment for bank lending and initial public offerings. The analysis suggests that these elements create a robust economic foundation that could lead to a boom, contrary to more pessimistic forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:13:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to address a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that pensioners in 2050 could be worse off than they are today. A Department for Work and Pensions analysis revealed that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly low earners and the self-employed, are not saving into a private pension. The commission, which previously led to the creation of auto-enrolment, will seek to build a national consensus on strategies to encourage saving. Experts and union leaders have welcomed the move as a vital step toward ensuring dignity and security in retirement for future generations.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old girl from Canada was found dead in Ticonderoga, New York, after her father had initially reported her as kidnapped. The father's report prompted an Amber Alert and a large-scale search operation near Lake George. However, investigators soon identified inconsistencies in his account of the events. Police have since stated that there is no indication an abduction occurred and that the investigation is now focused on the father's conflicting story. Authorities have not yet disclosed the cause of death or whether the father has been arrested in connection with the tragic incident.</p>

The alert applies to on-premise SharePoint servers, not the cloud-based SharePoint Online service. Microsoft has released a security update for its SharePoint Subscription Edition and is working on patches for other versions, urging customers to apply them immediately or disconnect servers from the internet.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll indicates that public support for former President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The decline in support coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals, and approval among Hispanic Americans has notably dropped. The survey also reveals persistent public concern over the economy, with seven in ten Americans believing the administration is not doing enough to lower prices. Most respondents also expressed disapproval of the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," viewing it as primarily benefiting the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a bruising election. Despite the significant setback, Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning, focusing instead on pressing trade negotiations. The defeat undermines the coalition's legislative power and reflects voter frustration over rising prices, a string of political scandals, and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. Analysts note that previous leaders who lost the upper house majority have resigned, suggesting Ishiba's position may become increasingly unstable amid internal party challenges.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project suggests it was beset by problems from its inception, due to inherent challenges in building major infrastructure in the country. Insiders and experts point to a combination of factors, including the project's ambitious goal of being the world's fastest railway, which dramatically increased costs. Furthermore, the UK's complex planning system and the political need to compromise with affected communities led to expensive changes, such as extensive tunneling. Critics argue these issues highlight a fundamental problem with how Britain approaches large-scale projects, leading to massive budget overruns and delays.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Announces Plan to Shutter EPA's Scientific Research Division</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to close the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific research arm. The move is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23% and save nearly $750 million. The ORD is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards and providing the scientific basis for regulations. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the decision as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health and will have generational impacts.</p>

          <p>During a concert in Wisconsin, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin offered a lighthearted warning to the audience before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where they feature fans on the large video screens. He jokingly advised attendees to do their makeup, a comment that follows a recent viral incident at another show. Last week, a man and woman were shown on the Jumbotron cuddling, and their quick separation sparked internet speculation that they were having an affair. The man, later identified as a tech CEO, has since resigned from his position following a formal investigation by his company.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Argues 'Self-Connection' is the Most Crucial Skill for Parents to Teach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships asserts that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand one's own emotions and needs. The article argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, protecting long-term mental health. It suggests that common parenting responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or upsets, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings. Instead, parents are advised to validate emotions, welcome all of a child's traits, and model their own emotional awareness.</p>

          <p>Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, describes the difficult position American businesses face in China amidst ongoing trade tensions. In an interview, he notes that while a recent 90-day pause on new tariffs is likely to be extended, the core discussions between the two nations have focused almost exclusively on tariffs, ignoring other critical issues. Stein expresses concern that this narrow focus fails to address the broader challenges and uncertainties for U.S. companies operating in the country. He suggests a potential path toward normalcy could involve reciprocal tariff reductions following China's recent actions on fentanyl precursors.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller has launched Better Angels, a nonprofit with a $300 million fund aimed at proving that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. The initiative seeks to use private equity and conventional loans to finance projects, cutting down the time and cost associated with government-funded developments. By providing capital upfront, Better Angels aims to attract for-profit developers to the affordable housing market. While the rents will be higher than in subsidized projects, the goal is to create a new, faster supply of housing for low- and moderate-income individuals, including those with Section 8 vouchers.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident at a Long Island medical center after being sucked into a running MRI machine. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy, 20-pound metallic chain used for weight training when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field drew him in, resulting in a fatal "medical episode." The victim's wife, who was the patient, said she had called him into the room for assistance. This incident highlights the extreme danger of bringing metallic objects near MRI machines, which use powerful magnets that can turn any magnetic item into a dangerous projectile.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has stated that as women's football grows in popularity, players are facing an increasing amount of abuse. Her comments come after teammate Jess Carter revealed she had received significant racial abuse on social media during the Euro 2025 tournament. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, the online targeting of female players seems to be a growing problem. In response, the Lionesses have decided to stop taking a knee before matches, seeking a new way to address racism, and have called for social media platforms to be held more accountable.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that despite a positive visit by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to China, his government's subsequent actions may be sabotaging its own diplomatic efforts. While Chinese media focused on the positive aspects of the visit, Australian media and opposition figures highlighted potential conflicts with the U.S. and criticized the trip. The author points specifically to the Australian government's stance on the potential sale of the Port of Darwin as a self-inflicted wound. This move, framed as defying a Chinese retaliation threat, undermines the message that Australia is a reliable partner for Chinese investment.</p>
