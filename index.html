          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reported that AI stocks have rebounded, suggesting Wall Street's concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek surpassing leading tech companies were unfounded. He noted the resurgence of data center-related stocks like Nvidia and AMD, indicating renewed confidence in the AI sector's growth potential. Cramer argued that the market's initial panic over DeepSeek's capabilities caused investors to prematurely sell off tech stocks. Looking back, Cramer believes it is now evident that these stocks should not have been sold in the first place, as DeepSeek's impact proved less significant than initially feared.

          <p>A U.S. intelligence agency assessed that Iran could potentially develop a nuclear weapon within three to eight months, although there was no definitive indication of an active decision to do so. This assessment was made on the same day that President Trump ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The intelligence summary indicated that Iranian officials had discussed concealing highly enriched uranium to prevent its destruction. Despite Iran's increased uranium enrichment, U.S. intelligence maintained that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003, although internal pressure to resume the program was noted. </p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticized a lawsuit filed by hardware startup Iyo, accusing OpenAI of trademark infringement. Altman described the lawsuit as "silly, disappointing, and wrong," noting Iyo's previous attempts to solicit investment from OpenAI. The lawsuit stemmed from OpenAI's announcement of acquiring Jony Ive's AI startup io, leading to OpenAI removing the announcement from its website due to a court order. Iyo claims that OpenAI's use of "IO" infringes on its trademark. </p>

          <p>President Trump is claiming a major diplomatic victory with the establishment of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, sharing praise from NATO officials for his decisive action in attacking Iranian nuclear facilities. However, despite the administration's claims that the US bombing raid "obliterated" Iran's nuclear research facilities, US military intelligence officials have indicated that the damage is not as severe as the White House has claimed. Questions remain about the quantity and location of Iran's enriched uranium supply, and reports suggest the existence of an undisclosed and undamaged research facility elsewhere in Iran. While the ceasefire is currently holding, the situation remains tenuous. </p>

God is portrayed as being involved in minor interventions, such as influencing lottery ticket purchases and assisting influencers, while ignoring larger global problems. The piece satirizes the idea of divine involvement in political decisions and the tendency to invoke God's name for self-serving purposes. </p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 individuals, citing changes in California law that narrowed the definition of gang activity. The decision follows mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased and violated California's Racial Justice Act. Gang injunctions, which restrict suspected gang members' activities, have been challenged as overly broad and draconian. Similar actions have been taken in other California jurisdictions, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Francisco. </p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's ceasefire between Israel and Iran, while appearing to be a foreign policy victory, may have made a crucial mistake that could bring about the very outcome that successive American presidents have sought to prevent: an Iranian nuclear weapon. Because the ceasefire is not linked to a diplomatic agreement with Iran on the future of its nuclear program, there is a risk that Iran will end cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Without eyes and ears on the ground, the international community will lose the ability to monitor Iranâ€™s program, and Iran could then choose to build a bomb covertly. </p>
