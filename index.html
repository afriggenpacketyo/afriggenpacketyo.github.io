          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $80,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility stemming from President Trump's global tariffs. The cryptocurrency's price dipped to its lowest level since November, mirroring a broader market sell-off driven by recession fears. This decline triggered substantial liquidations as traders betting on price increases were forced to sell, highlighting Bitcoin's vulnerability to wider economic anxieties. While some analysts suggest Bitcoin could benefit long-term from deglobalization, it currently trades in tandem with equities (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield increased above 4% despite concerns that President Trump's new tariffs could hinder economic growth. The tariffs, impacting over 180 countries, have led to fears of a global trade war as nations retaliate with their own tariffs. This situation has caused traders to anticipate lower Federal Reserve rates, with futures pricing indicating a high probability of rate cuts.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated that President Trump's recently announced tariffs are likely to increase prices on both imported and domestic goods, thereby slowing down an already weakening U.S. economy.

While acknowledging legitimate reasons for tariffs, he stressed the potential short-term inflationary outcomes and the cumulative negative effects over time.

          <p>A leading international relations scholar, Graham Allison, cautioned that war between the U.S. and China is likely, though not inevitable, due to the "Thucydides trap" dynamic. This concept suggests that a rising power and an established hegemon are prone to conflict. Allison's warning comes after President Trump imposed additional tariffs on China, escalating trade tensions. The interdependence of the two nations in areas like the economy and climate change could potentially mitigate the risk of conflict.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns that President Trump's sweeping tariffs will lead to a recession, increased prices, and job losses. A majority of CEOs (69%) expect a recession, with over half anticipating it will hit this year. Many CEOs are "war rooming" inflation scenarios and anticipate price hikes of 5% to 20%. Concerns also include potential boycotts of American brands and the negative impact on consumer sentiment. Most CEOs disagree that the tariffs will ultimately prove beneficial in the long term.</p>

Increased defense spending in Europe, driven by pressure from Trump and rising geopolitical tensions, is expected to boost the sector.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have caused significant disruption in global stock markets, raising concerns about a potential recession. While stock market performance does not always directly correlate with economic health, large falls in stock values indicate a reappraisal of future profits. Increased tariffs are expected to raise costs and reduce profits for companies, increasing the likelihood of a recession. An economy is defined as being in recession when spending and exports shrink for two consecutive three-month periods, and while it's too early to confirm, the risks have clearly increased.</p>
