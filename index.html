        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty against Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming the fine "excessive" and a violation of the Eighth Amendment. While the financial judgment was vacated, the court upheld other sanctions, including a three-year ban on Trump serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation. The deeply divided panel of justices struggled to reach a consensus, resulting in a complex series of opinions that ultimately eliminated the massive disgorgement award. New York's Attorney General has announced plans to appeal the decision to the state's highest court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent securities filings show that family offices of prominent billionaires like David Tepper, Leon Cooperman, and George Soros made significant portfolio adjustments in response to tariff and recession fears. Many exited positions in casino stocks with exposure to Macao and reduced holdings in major tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet. However, these investment firms also demonstrated opportunistic strategies, increasing stakes in semiconductor companies like Nvidia and TSMC, and investing in energy providers poised to benefit from AI's power demands. The moves reflect a blend of caution towards geopolitical risks and bold bets on long-term growth sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the country's third-largest steel manufacturer, has been placed under government control after a court granted a winding-up order due to hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. The collapse of the Liberty Steel subsidiary puts the future of nearly 1,500 jobs in Rotherham and Sheffield in jeopardy. The government will cover wages and costs while seeking a buyer for the business, which has been struggling for over a year. This move highlights the broader challenges facing the UK steel industry, including high energy prices and international competition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated his intention to personally join police and military personnel on patrol in Washington, D.C., on Thursday evening. The announcement follows his recent mobilization of the National Guard to address what he has described as a crime emergency in the nation's capital. Trump's direct involvement in overseeing the law enforcement surge is an unconventional move for a sitting president. The action comes a day after Vice President JD Vance and other officials were met with protests during a visit to National Guard troops stationed in the city.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have detailed the commitments under a new trade framework, which includes a 15% U.S. tariff on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and other goods. In return, the EU will eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and provide preferential market access for certain U.S. agricultural and seafood products. The agreement, which builds on a preliminary deal announced in July, also includes significant EU commitments for energy purchases and investments in U.S. AI chips. This pact aims to solidify the trade relationship between the two economic powers and avert higher potential tariffs threatened by the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Primary Disadvantages of Reverse Mortgages for Retirees</h2>

          <p>A financial article explains the significant drawbacks of reverse mortgages, a tool often marketed to seniors for accessing home equity. The primary disadvantages include high upfront fees, compounding interest that erodes home equity over time, and the risk of foreclosure if the homeowner fails to pay property taxes or insurance. Furthermore, these loans can significantly reduce the inheritance left to heirs, as the growing loan balance must be repaid upon the owner's death or departure. The article advises potential borrowers to carefully consider these risks and explore alternatives like downsizing or traditional home equity loans before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that approximately 44% of American adults are ordering kids' meals at restaurants, a trend driven by a desire for smaller portions and lower prices amid rising food costs. This consumer behavior coincides with reports from fast-food chains like McDonald's and Wendy's of sluggish sales, particularly among low-income customers feeling economic pressure. The cost of fast food has risen dramatically over the past decade, making the simpler, less expensive options on children's menus an attractive alternative for budget-conscious diners. The trend reflects broader consumer adjustments to ongoing inflation.</p>

This follows past controversies, including being filmed using a racial slur in 2021 and a recent misdemeanor charge, which have overshadowed his immense popularity.

The referral, initiated by FHFA Director Bill Pulte, alleges potential mortgage fraud, claiming Cook declared two different properties as her primary residence simultaneously. President Trump has publicly called for Cook's resignation, but she has stated she has no intention of being bullied into stepping down. The move intensifies the administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve, though Powell does not have the legal authority to fire a board member.</p>

          <p>A Memphis jury has found Hernandez Govan not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2021 killing of rapper Young Dolph. Prosecutors had alleged that Govan organized the ambush at a local bakery, but the jury was not convinced by the evidence, which heavily relied on the testimony of one of the admitted shooters. Govan’s defense questioned the police investigation and argued there was no direct evidence linking him to the crime in cellphone communications.

The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense against years of abuse, a claim prosecutors contest.

He asserts that this brand of comedy, by humanizing fascist ideas under the guise of free speech, has a tangible and destructive influence on cultural and political norms.

Their concerns are gaining traction as AI becomes more integrated into society.</p>

          <p>Newly released UK government data reveals a complex picture of its asylum policies, showing both challenges and some progress. The number of asylum applications reached a record high of 111,000 in the year to June, and small boat arrivals increased by 38% over the previous year. However, the government has significantly reduced the overall backlog by processing claims more quickly, and the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels remains far below its 2023 peak. The figures highlight the ongoing political and logistical difficulties in managing immigration, with officials making modest gains in some areas while facing record inflows.</p>

          <p>A satirical article in The Atlantic imagines what a museum designed by Donald Trump would be like, following his recent criticism of the Smithsonian as being too focused on negative aspects of American history like slavery. In this imagined museum, the past is replaced with a "bright" future filled with mirrors that make you look thin, hoverboards, and sci-fi gadgets. The piece humorously critiques Trump's aversion to historical introspection and his focus on success and self-promotion. The perfect museum, according to the satirical Trump narrator, would be more like an Apple Store, devoid of any challenging historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone, are investigating the recent $8 billion merger of Paramount and Skydance Media. They are examining whether the companies capitulated to "illegitimate demands" from President Trump to secure regulatory approval from the FCC. The probe focuses on a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to end a lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe." The investigation also scrutinizes reported commitments by the new company to alter CBS's editorial practices to align with the administration's political agenda.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic critiques the increasingly mainstream narrative that public-health restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic were known to be ineffective and did more harm than good. While acknowledging some policy mistakes, such as prolonged school closures, the author argues that the revisionist view dangerously overcorrects. The piece refutes claims that the pre-pandemic consensus was against measures like masks and closures, and it challenges the use of Sweden as a successful counterexample. The author warns that this revisionism could undermine public trust and leave the country unprepared for future pandemics.</p>

          <p>A financial article outlines the potential returns for investing $25,000 in a certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. While yields have decreased from their 2023 peak, rates near 4% are still common, offering a stable and predictable return compared to variable-rate savings accounts. The article breaks down the estimated interest earned over various terms, from approximately $269 for a 3-month CD to over $5,250 for a 5-year CD. It emphasizes that CDs provide a safe way to grow cash without market risk, but advises savers to match the term length to their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>
