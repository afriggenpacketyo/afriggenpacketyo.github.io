          <p>Former Cleveland manager Terry Francona has voiced his support for the team's name change from the "Indians" to the "Guardians." He stated he was proud of the organization for making a respectful decision, pushing back against recent calls from Donald Trump to revert to the old name. Francona suggested that opposition to the change often comes from a perspective that doesn't consider the feelings of all communities. The team's current management has also dismissed the political pressure, indicating they are focused on building the Guardians brand.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has reached a deal with the Trump administration to restore $400 million in federal funding, but the agreement has sparked controversy. In exchange for the funds, Columbia will pay over $220 million in settlements and implement new measures that critics argue will restrict academic freedom and pro-Palestinian speech. Supporters of the deal believe it brings necessary structural reforms to combat antisemitism on campus. The agreement is seen as a significant moment for higher education, setting a precedent for government influence over university policies.</p>

          <p>UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has stated that the government understands the public's "huge frustration" regarding the pressure the asylum system places on the national housing supply. The issue is highlighted by competition between the Home Office, which houses asylum seekers, and local councils seeking accommodation for homeless residents. Reynolds emphasized that the long-term solution involves building more homes, accelerating asylum claim processing, and reducing illegal crossings. Critics and local councils are calling for more immediate action and better cooperation between government departments to alleviate the crisis.</p>

The specific assets at risk depend heavily on whether one files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Chapter 7, or "liquidation" bankruptcy, may require selling non-exempt property like second homes or valuable collectibles to repay creditors. In contrast, Chapter 13 involves a repayment plan that typically allows individuals to keep their property.

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a senior official from the Department of Justice, met with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell at a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. The meeting was arranged after President Trump directed the DOJ to pursue all credible evidence related to the case. Maxwell's attorney stated that she would "always testify truthfully," while the House Oversight Committee has separately subpoenaed her for a deposition in August.</p>

          <p>Following the life sentencing of Bryan Kohberger, police released documents revealing strange occurrences at the victims' home in the weeks before the murders. One victim, Kaylee Goncalves, had reported seeing an unknown man staring at her and had mentioned having a stalker. The documents detail the extensive investigation, including following up on numerous tips and using DNA from a knife sheath to identify Kohberger. The records also describe Kohberger's brief interaction with police after his arrest, where he requested a lawyer before any substantive questioning about the crime could occur.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax" and has called for "full transparency" and justice for all involved. His comments stand in contrast to President Trump, who has used the word "hoax" to describe some of his supporters' intense focus on the case. The remarks come as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information from the federal investigations into the late sex offender. Johnson's stance reflects a divide on the issue, even as he resisted a floor vote to force the release of DOJ files.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups and lawyers are urging the German government to clarify its policy regarding asylum seekers from Palestinian territories. Germany's migration office had previously "deprioritized" processing applications from Gaza, citing an "uncertain situation," a move that courts repeatedly ruled against. Now, with processing resumed, advocates argue that Palestinians should be granted full refugee status under the Geneva Convention, rather than the lesser "subsidiary protection." This is particularly relevant as the UN agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) faces operational bans, which could legally trigger full protection status.</p>

A former EPA official involved in the original finding called the move a rejection of "clear cut" science that has only become more evident.
