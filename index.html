          <p>A public dispute erupted between Donald Trump and Elon Musk after Musk criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" as a "disgusting abomination" that would increase the budget deficit. Musk had previously served as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) but left the position recently. Trump responded by suggesting Musk was upset about the removal of electric vehicle mandates, which could negatively affect Tesla. The exchange escalated quickly, involving accusations and counter-accusations, highlighting a rift between the former allies. Optimism surrounding the future of this conflict is tempered by the high stakes involved.</p>

          <p>David Beckham is anticipated to be knighted in King Charles' Birthday Honours list, adding to his previous appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2003. This recognition celebrates Beckham's achievements in football, including 115 appearances for England and successful stints with Manchester United, LA Galaxy, Paris St-Germain, and AC Milan, as well as his contributions to British society. Beckham was initially nominated for a knighthood in 2011, and despite leaked emails in 2017 criticizing the honors system, his role in securing the London 2012 Olympics and his ambassadorships for Unicef and the King's Foundation have solidified his candidacy. The award highlights Beckham's continued positive impact beyond his athletic career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological findings in Shandong, eastern China, suggest that a matrilineal community thrived around 4,500 years ago, marking it as the world's earliest known society of this kind. Researchers analyzed ancient DNA from 60 individuals dating between 2750 and 2500 BC, confirming the existence of a Neolithic society that traced lineage through the female line. The community farmed millet, raised animals, and potentially engaged in fishing, maintaining a stable lineage for at least 10 generations over 250 years. The discovery supports the idea that early matrilineal systems could emerge and persist in communities without strong mechanisms for wealth accumulation.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, resulting in at least three deaths and 49 injuries, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The strikes targeted Kyiv, Lutsk, and the Ternopil region, following warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin about responding to recent Ukrainian strikes on Russian airbases. Zelenskyy urged America, Europe, and the rest of the world to unite and pressure Russia to end the war, referencing a lack of willingness to put pressure on Russia and calling it complicity. The attack damaged metro tracks in Kyiv, disrupting the city's train system and forcing civilians to seek shelter underground.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the rationale behind Donald Trump's travel ban, which includes full restrictions on citizens of 12 countries and partial constraints on seven others, several of which are African nations. The policy is part of an immigration crackdown aimed at addressing security threats, according to Trump. An exemption within the order could apply to participants in the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2028 Olympics, ensuring minimal disruption to these events. Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics expressed confidence that the ban would not affect the Games or their preparations, acknowledging special consideration for the Olympics in the directive.</p>

          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing each year due to lost, damaged, or missing evidence, according to a BBC investigation. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reveals that over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including 70 homicides and over 550 sexual assault cases. The CPS records these cases as "E72" when police do not have the necessary evidence to secure a conviction, with figures suggesting an increasing trend. The loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service (FSS) in 2012 and cuts to police forces are cited as contributing factors, leading to a lack of resources and expertise at a local level.</p>

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May due to fluctuating tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, with economists forecasting the addition of 125,000 jobs, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000. The U.S.-China trade agreement in May reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, boosting the stock market, while the White House paused some of Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. Despite these actions, an across-the-board 10% tariff remains on nearly all imports, excluding semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, with China facing 30% tariffs. Major companies have warned of potential losses due to tariff-related uncertainty, though key economic measures have largely defied fears of a downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy Jr. has promoted "freedom of choice" in health decisions, yet his policies have drawn criticism for limiting access to certain products. Kennedy removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC's immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, requiring shared-clinical decision-making. He has also advocated for states to ban food stamp recipients from purchasing soda and praised states for banning fluoride from public drinking water.
