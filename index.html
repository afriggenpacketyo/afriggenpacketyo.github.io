          <p>The NFL season commenced with the Philadelphia Eagles narrowly defeating the Dallas Cowboys 24-20, in a game interrupted by a 65-minute lightning delay. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected early for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, impacting the game's dynamics. Jalen Hurts scored two touchdowns for the Eagles, while Javonte Williams scored twice for the Cowboys. Despite the weather interruption and Carter's ejection, the Eagles managed to secure the win, showcasing resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges. The final score reflects the competitive nature of the game and the impact of key plays and disruptions. Optimism surrounds the Eagles' ability to overcome adversity, but concerns linger regarding player discipline. The game ended late due to the delay.</p>

          <p>Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, assured that the UK's national security is secure for the present and coming years, citing its nuclear power status and NATO membership. In an interview, Radakin praised the UK's response to the Ukraine invasion and emphasized the importance of European nations taking responsibility for their security. He dismissed concerns about a new non-NATO axis forming, urging skepticism towards military parades as indicators of deeper alliances. Radakin highlighted the difficulties Russia faces in the Ukraine conflict and underscored the strength of Western alliances in addressing global security challenges. He noted the commitment of multiple Prime Ministers to supporting Ukraine, and the UK's clear stance on the Russian invasion. This paints a picture of cautious optimism.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies not shifting production to the U.S., while indicating potential exemptions for firms like Apple that increase domestic investments. He emphasized discussions with tech leaders about chips and semiconductors, signaling imminent tariffs. Trump referenced Apple's commitment to invest in domestic manufacturing as a factor influencing tariff considerations. The U.S. has been actively working to bring semiconductor supply chains onshore, attracting investments from major companies like TSMC and Samsung. The move aims to incentivize domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign sources for critical technologies. This development could reshape the semiconductor industry and global supply chains.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is seeking Supreme Court intervention to affirm the president's authority to dismiss a Federal Trade Commission member, challenging lower court rulings. The case stems from President Trump's attempt to fire Rebecca Slaughter, which was blocked by lower courts citing restrictions on removing members of independent agencies without cause. The Justice Department argues that the FTC and similar agencies are under presidential control, granting the power to remove commissioners. The case could potentially lead the Supreme Court to reconsider the 1935 Humphrey’s Executor decision, impacting the structure and independence of federal agencies. This legal battle highlights ongoing tensions between executive power and the autonomy of regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>Potential buyers have submitted offers valuing Starbucks' China operations at around US$5 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. This valuation makes the potential deal one of the most significant China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. Starbucks is proceeding with the sale amidst slower growth and increased competition from local brands. The offers value Starbucks China at about 10 times its expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in 2025. The valuation multiple is similar to that of its rival, Luckin Coffee, suggesting a competitive market assessment.</p>

          <h2>President Trump to Rename the Defense Department as the Department of War</h2>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. The name change would revert the department to a title it held for much of its history. The executive order will authorize Defense Department officials to substitute the word 'war' into their titles. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge the change in a social media post. The move has sparked debate about its implications and historical context.</p>

          <p>An analysis criticizes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, calling it a 'cringe' move. The author argues that the change reflects a misguided obsession with toughness and warfighting. The Department of Defense was established in 1947 to reflect a broader approach to national security. The author notes that many countries, including China and Russia, use the term 'defense' for their military organizations. This change is seen as a reflection of Trump's political style.</p>
