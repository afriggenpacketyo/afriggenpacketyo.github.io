          <p>President Trump has repeatedly hinted at seeking a third term, despite constitutional limitations.  While he claims it's not a joke, experts deem amending the Constitution highly improbable.  His comments might be a strategic maneuver to project strength and counter the perception of a lame-duck presidency, given his repeated mentions since September 2020.</p>
