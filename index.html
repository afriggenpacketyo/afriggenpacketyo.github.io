          <p>Jewish high school students across North America are facing increased antisemitism following the October 7th attacks on Israel, with incidents of harassment, intimidation, and threats becoming more common. The Anti-Defamation League reports a 140% increase in antisemitic incidents, including hate speech, vandalism, and assaults, largely within schools and colleges. Many Jewish students are now feeling compelled to defend their identity, often without adequate institutional support. Schools are urged to update anti-harassment policies, train staff to identify modern forms of antisemitism, and foster an environment where Jewish identity is respected and supported.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to between 50% and 65%, a move that helped boost U.S. equity markets. These cuts would substantially reduce the tariffs Trump set at 145% earlier this month, signaling a recalibration of trade strategy. While no final decisions have been made, a tiered system is being considered to differentiate between strategic and non-strategic goods, with strategic goods facing tariffs of at least 100%. Trump stated that the duties “will not be as high as 145 per cent” and that “it’ll come down substantially, but won’t be zero”.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is experiencing a third day of gains, heading towards $95,000, amid a broad market relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and rhetoric against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The price of Bitcoin was last up 1.3% at $92,654, having reached a high of $94,499.86 earlier in the day, its highest level since March 3. The cryptocurrency has recovered about half of its losses since Inauguration Day and is hovering just under the flat line for the year. According to Joel Kruger, this surge reflects the market capitalizing on a dip in an asset that provides portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

          <p>Buprenorphine, a medication that can significantly reduce opioid cravings and overdose deaths, remains underutilized in the U.S. due to stigma and a narrow definition of sobriety.

This shift has been influenced by the Republican party's emphasis on law and order and the rise of "abortion abolitionists" who advocate for punishing women who undergo the procedure.</p>
