Low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford air conditioning, posing health risks.

          <p>Chad's former prime minister, Succes Masra, has been arrested for allegedly inciting hatred related to deadly clashes that resulted in dozens of deaths. Masra's party claims he was "kidnapped" by judicial police, while the public prosecutor states he is being investigated for incitement, complicity in murder, and desecration of graves. The arrest follows Masra's return from exile and his appointment as prime minister in January 2024, prior to the presidential election where he ran against President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno.</p>

The analysis found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year could see their after-tax income fall beginning in 2026 due to cuts in federal spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Meanwhile, the top 0.1 percent would gain significantly from tax cuts on the wealthy and businesses.</p>
