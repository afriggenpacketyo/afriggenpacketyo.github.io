        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel landmines. This move allows them to produce and deploy mines to create a deterrent against potential Russian aggression, forming what some analysts call a new "Iron Curtain." The decision is highly controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, with critics highlighting the immense human and environmental costs. Proponents, however, argue it is a necessary defensive measure against an existential threat, given Russia's extensive mine stockpiles and use in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss. Ohtani expressed satisfaction with his aggressive approach on the mound, marking a positive step in his recovery from elbow surgery. In other MLB action, Seiya Suzuki hit his 22nd home run for the Chicago Cubs.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in numerous public outdoor areas, including all beaches, parks, and near schools and swimming pools, which went into effect on Sunday. The measure aims to reduce the impact of passive smoking, which causes thousands of deaths annually, and is part of a broader strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators face fines up to â‚¬700, though there is an initial grace period. The new rules, which do not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, come as France still has one of Europe's higher smoking rates, with over 30% of adults partaking.</p>

          <p>A volunteer at a Leicester church has detailed a harrowing stalking campaign by a Church of England lay preacher, Venessa Pinto, which began after he rejected her romantic advances. The victim, Jay Hulme, faced online harassment, false accusations, and threats, which he reported to both the police and the church. An internal HR investigation found Pinto responsible, but the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, initially dismissed the complaint and accused Hulme of witchcraft. Pinto was eventually convicted of stalking after police revisited the case, and the bishop has since apologized for his handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police are reviewing footage of comments made by musical acts at the Glastonbury Festival, following controversial on-stage statements. The review focuses on rap-punk duo Bob Vylan, who led chants calling for "death to the IDF," and Irish-language rap group Kneecap, whose member faces a terrorism charge. The government condemned the chants, and the BBC, which broadcast the performance, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the set available on its iPlayer service. The incident highlights growing tensions around political expression at major cultural events, with organizers and broadcasters navigating complex issues of free speech and public offense.</p>

Organizers and participants are highlighting concerns over recent political and legislative challenges to LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals.

          <p>A weather system in the western Gulf of Mexico has organized into Tropical Depression Two, with forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expecting it to strengthen into Tropical Storm Barry before making landfall. As of late Saturday, the depression was located east-northeast of Veracruz, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. A tropical storm warning is in effect for a portion of the Mexican coast, where heavy rainfall and strong winds are anticipated. If it intensifies as predicted, it will be the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, potentially bringing 3 to 10 inches of rain to several Mexican states.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in China are increasingly avoiding dining out, a lifestyle change prompted by stringent and often unpredictable local austerity measures that can exceed central government regulations. An official in Sichuan province noted that his department head implemented a dine-out ban in May, reflecting a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control. This trend highlights the intense pressure on local officials to demonstrate fiscal discipline and political loyalty. The heightened scrutiny is part of a broader campaign to curb extravagance and corruption within the party and state apparatus, impacting the daily lives and social habits of government employees.</p>

One case involves Mandonna Kashanian, who has resided in the U.S. for 47 years and was arrested at her New Orleans home despite regularly checking in with immigration officials as required. Advocacy groups worry this is part of a broader, targeted roundup, as the Department of Homeland Security has touted the arrests of at least 11 Iranians on immigration violations.

          <p>Collagen supplements are gaining popularity for their purported benefits to joint health, but scientific evidence confirming their effectiveness remains limited. Type II collagen is the primary protein in joint cartilage, which deteriorates with age and has poor regenerative capacity, leading to issues like arthritis. While some small studies suggest collagen may help alleviate joint pain, researchers and medical professionals emphasize that more robust, large-scale studies are needed to make definitive recommendations. Experts note that while supplements are generally safe to try, proven methods for supporting joint health include maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise, and consuming a protein-rich diet.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has advanced a significant domestic policy package, referred to by President Trump as the "big, beautiful bill," after a prolonged and dramatic late-night procedural vote. The measure cleared the hurdle with a 51-49 vote only after Republican leadership secured the support of several holdouts, including Senator Ron Johnson who switched his vote at the last minute. The bill, which includes deep cuts to Medicaid and other sweeping changes, now moves to a final debate and vote, which is expected early in the coming week. The legislation's path remains challenging as it will also need to pass the House again. (not investment advice)</p>

The blaze, which started late Saturday afternoon, prompted mandatory evacuations and road closures, forcing over 100 campers and beachgoers to flee the area, with some escaping 100-foot flames. Boaters and jet skiers assisted in evacuating people from the beach to a safer location on Highway 173. Fire crews are battling the fire from the ground and air, but officials warn that strong winds forecasted for Monday could challenge suppression efforts.

Fans and musicians, including Sheffield native Richard Hawley, have expressed their sorrow over the closure, describing it as the end of an era and a significant loss for the local music scene.

          <p>A jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of his former classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, was stabbed to death in an Orange County park. Prosecutors presented evidence of Woodward's deep involvement with the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, arguing the murder was motivated by hate. The defense claimed Woodward acted impulsively after an unwanted sexual advance, but the jury sided with the prosecution's argument of a premeditated, hate-fueled attack. The verdict means Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits and combat rising obesity rates. Under the plan, food retailers will be responsible for making healthy options more appealing and accessible, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or product reformulations. While the initiative is voluntary and does not impose specific targets, businesses will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. The policy is part of a broader 10-year NHS plan aimed at creating the "healthiest generation of children ever" and reducing the strain on the national health service.</p>

          <p>A private funeral was held for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their dog, who were killed in their home earlier this month. The service was attended by hundreds, including Governor Tim Walz, who eulogized Hortman as the most consequential speaker in state history and a dedicated public servant. The couple was remembered for their commitment to improving the lives of Minnesotans and their welcoming nature. The suspected killer, Vance Boelter, was arrested after a massive manhunt and faces federal charges, including murder and stalking, for the attack on the Hortmans and a separate shooting that injured another state senator and his wife.</p>

          <p>The U.S. version of the reality show "Love Island" is experiencing its most-watched season, but its success has been shadowed by intense cyberbullying directed at contestants. The harassment prompted the show and its host to issue public pleas for viewers to be more mindful. The UK franchise, which has been on air for a decade, has a well-documented history of post-show mental health struggles among its cast, including two deaths by suicide, leading to government inquiries and enhanced welfare protocols. While producers say they have learned from past tragedies and offer extensive psychological support, experts note the inherent conflict between producing dramatic television and ensuring contestant well-being.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a strong warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at judges from both sides of the aisle. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts stated that such language wraps judges in political disputes and creates a risk that someone might be incited to violence. He noted that there have been serious threats against judges simply for performing their duties, alluding to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn statements from both President Trump and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. His remarks came as the Supreme Court concluded its term, underscoring ongoing concerns about judicial independence and safety.</p>

In a series of posts on X, Musk called the Senate draft of the bill "political suicide for the Republican Party," reigniting a conflict with the administration he recently departed. This public opposition creates another challenge for Republican leaders who are working to pass the nearly 1,000-page bill. The back-and-forth follows a previous rift where Trump threatened to review federal subsidies for Musk's companies after the CEO harshly criticized the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

President Vucic dismissed the protests as a foreign plot to destabilize the country. The demonstrations, which have been ongoing for months and are led by students, were sparked by a deadly building collapse in November that protesters attribute to corruption.

REalloys itself is planning a $50 million facility to produce high-performance magnet materials by 2027, using ore from Brazil processed in Canada.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect." This effect is particularly noticeable during heatwaves, where city centers can be 4-6Â°C warmer. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, releasing it slowly. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and intense, the growing populations of cities will bear the brunt of this extreme heat and its associated health risks.</p>

Protesters carried banners with slogans like "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," contrasting the celebrity-filled parties with the city's precarious state.
