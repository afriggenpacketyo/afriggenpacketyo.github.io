        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A yellow weather warning has been issued for thunderstorms and potential flooding in parts of England and Wales, following the driest start to spring in 69 years. The Met Office forecasts up to 50mm of rain could fall within a few hours, potentially causing delays to train and bus services. Despite the brief change, temperatures are expected to remain mild, and settled conditions are predicted to return for the rest of the week, with temperatures reaching up to 23C in some areas. Last week, the Environment Agency cautioned water companies to improve safeguarding water supplies after weeks of dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Massachusetts after spending six weeks in ICE detention in Louisiana. A federal judge ordered her release on bail after she was detained for allegedly violating her visa due to an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and stated her belief in the American justice system, while also highlighting the plight of other women in immigration detention. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, and she will continue her case in court.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, announced that the recruitment of care workers from overseas will end as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration and prioritize domestic workers. New rules will require firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country, with the government aiming to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers from entering the UK over the next year. The government also plans to raise the threshold for skilled visas and implement stricter training requirements to encourage unemployed individuals to re-enter the labor market, while Nadra Ahmed of the National Care Association expressed concerns about the potential challenges this will create for care homes.</p>

          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport for several weeks to address ongoing radar outages, flight delays, and air traffic controller shortages. Duffy stated he will meet with airlines to determine the extent of the reduction, focusing on afternoons with heavier international arrivals.

Duffy also intends to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 and offer a 20% bonus for those who stay on the job, as the Trump administration proposes a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the US air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Wildfires have erupted across Britain amid the driest start to spring in nearly 70 years, affecting areas in Scotland, Wales, and England, and officials have warned of a potential drought this summer. A large forest fire near Fauldhouse, Scotland, required 50 firefighters and a helicopter to contain, while southwest Wales also experienced a wildfire. England has seen its driest start to spring since 1956, with rainfall significantly below average, leading to concerns about water levels in rivers and potential water restrictions.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Official Suggests Baseline Tariff Will Likely Remain</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is likely to remain in place for the "foreseeable future," echoing President Trump's previous comments. Lutnick rejected concerns that consumers would bear the brunt of the tariffs, asserting that businesses and countries would ultimately pay the costs. However, data indicates that businesses are already attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. Lutnick argued that domestically produced products without tariffs would force foreign competitors to compete more effectively.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have seemingly de-escalated after a four-day clash involving new military technologies, including weaponized drones and missiles, marking a significant shift from previous conflicts. Despite the truce, underlying tensions remain volatile due to entrenched religious nationalism in both countries. International diplomacy played a crucial role in averting further escalation, but the limited engagement highlighted a diminished sense of global responsibility. The conflict underscored the need for both countries to address their reliance on foreign weapons sales and the political realities driving their uncompromising approaches.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are expressing concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on their businesses, with some facing potential closures due to increased costs. Beth Benike, owner of Busy Baby, a Minnesota company selling baby products made in China, faces a $230,000 tariff bill to import her goods, potentially leading to the loss of her business and home. Marissa Held-Nordling, owner of Little Roo's, has seen changes in shopper behavior as customers stockpile baby registry gifts due to uncertainty. Economic analyst Kyla Scanlon suggests that the tariffs are unnecessary and create an unfavorable economic environment for small businesses.</p>

While AI platforms enhance search capabilities, they are far from replacing human employees, particularly in small and mid-sized businesses. The technology is often unreliable, expensive to implement, and raises concerns about data security and intellectual property. Experts suggest that the widespread replacement of workers by AI is still years away.</p>
