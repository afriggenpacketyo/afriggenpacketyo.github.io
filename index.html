          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivered a record-breaking floor speech to vehemently oppose a major Republican-backed spending and tax cut package. In response, House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed the speech as "performance," contrasting it with what he called the Republican party's focus on delivering results for the American people. The contentious debate highlights the deep partisan divisions surrounding the bill, which aims to fund significant portions of the Trump administration's agenda. The bill's passage is anticipated despite the lengthy Democratic opposition.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to cut nearly 75% of the staff from its Office of Intelligence and Analysis, reducing its workforce from around 1,000 to 275. This move, intended to eliminate redundant positions, has sparked significant concern among law enforcement agencies and lawmakers, who warn it could create dangerous security gaps. The office is the only intelligence community member tasked with sharing threat information with state and local partners.

          <p>Numerous migrant shelters across the United States, from Arizona and Texas to New York and Massachusetts, are shutting down due to a significant drop in migrant arrivals. The White House attributes this decline to the "Trump Effect," citing the end of what it terms Joe Biden's "illegal alien invasion." This trend coincides with the closure of temporary border processing facilities and a sharp decrease in southern border apprehensions. The administration is now seeking to make these changes permanent through a major funding bill aimed at bolstering border security and deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>With average credit card debt nearing $8,000 per cardholder and interest rates at historic highs, many Americans are making costly financial mistakes. This article outlines five key errors, including making only minimum payments, which can prolong debt for decades and significantly increase interest costs. Other pitfalls include ignoring the expiration of promotional 0% APR offers, using expensive cash advances, and closing old credit cards, which can harm credit scores. Falling even slightly behind on payments can trigger steep penalty rates, making it crucial to manage debt proactively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty of two counts of transportation for prostitution but acquitted him of more severe charges like sex trafficking and racketeering. While this verdict is a partial legal victory, sparing him a potential life sentence, he still faces up to 10 years in prison for each conviction and dozens of civil lawsuits. Prosecutors portrayed Combs as the leader of a criminal enterprise that used drugs and coercion to force women into sex acts. The judge has ordered him to remain jailed until sentencing.</p>

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest number of measles cases since 2019, with over 1,200 infections confirmed across at least 37 states. The largest outbreak is centered in West Texas, where over 750 cases have been reported, resulting in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the resurgence of this highly contagious disease to declining vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold needed for community immunity. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is considered highly safe and effective at preventing the disease and its severe complications.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the repeal of clean-energy tax credits in the Republican-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill" is a profoundly self-defeating policy. At a time of rapidly rising electricity demand from AI data centers and EVs, the bill removes incentives for wind and solar, the primary sources of new power generation. This move is projected to significantly increase energy costs for American consumers, particularly in Republican-leaning states, and make the power grid less reliable. The author suggests the policy is driven more by partisan animosity towards clean energy than by sound economic or energy strategy.</p>
