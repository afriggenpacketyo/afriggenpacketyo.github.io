          <p>Gold prices surpassed $4,300 per troy ounce this week, marking a record high driven by investor anxiety over economic uncertainty. Factors contributing to the surge include the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, global trade tensions, and the prospect of lower interest rates, which make gold a more attractive 'safe haven' asset. The article notes that central banks have also increased their gold reserves amid geopolitical conflicts, while consumers face higher prices for gold jewelry. Experts caution that gold is not always a reliable hedge against inflation and advise against over-allocating investments into the volatile precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of a sprint weekend format, this was the only practice opportunity for teams before sprint qualifying. Norris finished ahead of Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, whom he trails in the championship standings. The session saw various teams testing different tire compounds, with Mercedes' George Russell and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton finishing further down the timesheets after setting their best laps on medium tires.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted a strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean Sea, with an official confirming that there were survivors for the first time in a series of recent attacks. This marks the sixth known strike in the region since last month, with previous attacks resulting in at least 27 fatalities. President Trump stated the vessel was carrying drugs, justifying the attacks under a 'non-international armed conflict' with drug cartels. Survivors were transported to a U.S. Navy ship, raising legal questions as some lawmakers challenge the administration's authority to conduct such strikes without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel connecting Russia and Alaska as 'interesting' and stated he would consider it. The pitch, made by a Russian investment envoy, suggested the 70-mile link could be built for a fraction of traditional estimates using Musk's technology. The proposal comes amid diplomatic discussions between Trump and Russian President Putin regarding the war in Ukraine, drawing concern from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The article highlights significant logistical challenges, including seismic activity and freezing temperatures, as well as The Boring Company's past regulatory violations.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. While Trump acknowledged the potential for a trade involving Ukrainian-made drones, he also expressed concern about depleting U.S. stockpiles of the crucial weapon. The discussion occurs as Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, where he hopes to broker an end to the war. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for continued pressure on Putin, stating he believes the Russian leader is not yet ready for peace.</p>

This call for a probe aligns with the Trump administration's recent designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.

Democrats are reportedly unwilling to accept any informal agreements, fearing the President might retract his support, as he has done with past bipartisan deals.

The article suggests that lenders frequently 'price in' expected cuts, meaning borrowers could see more favorable rates in the coming days rather than after the meeting.

          <p>An investigation has found that Jordan Parke, a cosmetics practitioner known as the 'Lip King,' is illegally selling prescription-only weight-loss injections online. This discovery comes while Parke is on bail after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of a client, Alice Webb, who died after receiving a non-surgical butt lift from him last year. Webb's family expressed anger at the findings, as another woman had previously been hospitalized after taking weight-loss drugs supplied by Parke. The case highlights significant gaps in the regulation of the UK's cosmetics industry, which allows un-qualified individuals to perform high-risk procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian editorial contends that the U.S. is shifting from a 'rule of law' to 'rule by law,' where the justice system is used as a political weapon by the executive branch. The article points to the recent indictments of high-profile Trump critics, including former national security adviser John Bolton, as evidence of this trend. It argues that President Trump is openly pursuing personal vindictiveness as political retribution, a stance supported by a significant portion of his base. This alleged abuse of power, combined with his pardoning of January 6 rioters, imperils the foundational role of an independent judiciary in a democracy.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Genentech announced it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to some patients at a significant discount, aiming to improve access for those who are uninsured or have limited coverage. Through partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs, the single-dose antiviral treatment will be available for a $50 cash payment, which is 70% below its list price. This move is part of a broader trend of drugmakers adopting direct-to-consumer models and comes amid pressure from the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the U.S. ahead of the winter flu season.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with privately financed construction projects at the White House, including a new $250 million ballroom, to cement his architectural legacy. A recent dinner honored major corporate and individual donors who are funding the project, which has drawn criticism and scrutiny from Democrats. California Representative Mark Takano has introduced bills to ban donor names on White House structures and prohibit federally funded construction during a shutdown. The House Oversight Committee has also launched a preliminary investigation into the ballroom's financing, questioning potential influence from foreign or corporate donors.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction novel, a thriller titled 'Gone Before Goodbye,' with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book centers on a talented female surgeon who becomes entangled in a conspiracy, a character Witherspoon wanted to be defined by her skills rather than her sex appeal. She explained that her upbringing in a medical family and her desire to see more complex female-led stories inspired the project. Witherspoon, who founded the production company Hello Sunshine to champion such narratives, says she continues to see a gap in Hollywood for strong, multifaceted female roles.</p>

          <p>The New York Republican state committee has suspended its Young Republicans chapter after leaked messages revealed members using racist, antisemitic, and other offensive language. A report published by Politico exposed thousands of pages of chats from a Telegram group, implicating leaders of the youth organization. In the messages, members praised Hitler, used racial slurs, and joked about violence against political opponents. The state party chair condemned the 'vile language' and said it has no place in the party, following similar moves by the Kansas GOP, which disbanded its youth chapter in response to the leaks.</p>

          <p>NATO members are demonstrating increased unity and resolve in response to recent, aggressive Russian airspace violations over countries like Poland and Estonia. An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that Vladimir Putin's attempts to intimidate the alliance have backfired, prompting NATO to establish a more coordinated defense on its eastern flank. This alignment is bolstered by President Trump's recent affirmations of support for defending Baltic nations. European leaders are now calling for an integrated 'drone wall' and are taking a more assertive stance, signaling that further provocations will be met with force.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is set to pay an additional $828 million to resolve 414 child sexual assault cases, adding to a historic $4 billion settlement approved earlier this year. The claims stem from alleged abuse that occurred in county-run juvenile facilities and foster homes, with a state law change allowing survivors to sue for decades-old incidents. This new payout brings the county's total for such cases to nearly $5 billion this year, placing significant strain on its budget. The county has stated it will implement extra vetting for claims filed by one law firm following reports of fraudulent lawsuits.</p>
