          <p>Tensions between India and China are manifesting within key international forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), potentially hindering Beijing's leadership ambitions in the Global South. Decision-making in these groups requires consensus, a rule India has used to assert its own strategic interests, particularly concerning issues like terrorism. A recent SCO defense ministers' meeting failed to produce a joint statement due to disagreements over language, highlighting the ongoing friction since the 2020 Galwan Valley border clash and India's role as a counterweight to Chinese dominance.</p>

          <p>The British government is officially banning the direct-action group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization after a High Court judge rejected a last-minute appeal to block the measure. The proscription, which takes effect at midnight, makes supporting or being a member of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision follows a series of disruptive protests and property damage, including an estimated £7 million in damage to planes at an RAF base. The group argues it is a non-violent civil disobedience movement being unfairly targeted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a last-minute temporary stay, pausing the deportation of eight migrants from a U.S. military facility in Djibouti to South Sudan. The move came just hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for their removal, creating a tense legal race against time. The men, convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., were being sent to a country where they have no ties and could face torture or harm. The judge's order allows for further legal arguments, focusing on the humanitarian risks of deporting individuals to a dangerous and unfamiliar nation.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed President Trump's signature tax and spending package, a bill that makes permanent most of the 2017 tax cuts while boosting defense and border security funding. The legislation is funded in part by significant cuts to social programs, including imposing work requirements on Medicaid and restricting SNAP benefits, which the CBO estimates could leave millions without health coverage. The bill also increases the SALT deduction cap, repeals green energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, reflecting major second-term priorities.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's newly passed spending bill is being clarified by policy experts, who note it does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits as some have claimed. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 below certain income thresholds, which can be applied against their total income. While this will provide tax relief for millions, it is not a direct repeal of the tax on Social Security payments. Critics also note the measure will not benefit the lowest-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, arguing it "turned the world upside down" by creating the concept of a citizen. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's ideals have inspired global movements for centuries, even though the document itself excluded many groups. Burns advocated for embracing the nation's complex and often contradictory history, including the flaws of its founders, as a way to create a richer, more accessible story for everyone.</p>

          <p>A court has heard that a violent confrontation involving two brothers and three police officers at Manchester Airport allegedly began with an assault in a Starbucks. Prosecutors claim the brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad, used a "high level of violence" against the officers who were attempting to arrest one of them for head-butting and punching another man. The defendants, who deny the allegations and claim self-defense, were at the airport to collect their mother. The trial is ongoing, with CCTV footage expected to be a key piece of evidence for the jury.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new spending package will create a temporary tax deduction for tipped workers, rather than a complete elimination of federal income tax on tips. The measure allows eligible workers, such as waiters and bartenders, to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income, though the break is set to expire in 2028. While the White House touts this as a win for the working class, critics argue it will not benefit the lowest-paid workers, many of whom earn too little to have a federal tax liability in the first place.

          <p>President Donald Trump has floated an unconventional idea for celebrating the 250th anniversary of the United States next year: hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. During a speech in Iowa, Trump said he had discussed the proposal with UFC CEO Dana White, envisioning an event for 20,000 to 25,000 people as part of the America250 festivities. The proposal is unprecedented, as the White House has never hosted a professional sporting event of this nature. Trump, a longtime fan and attendee of UFC events, suggested White would handle the logistics.</p>

The decision follows reports and opposition from biologists and environmental groups who warned the project would severely harm the many protected seabird species that nest on the island. The program aimed to test the delivery of up to 100 tons of cargo anywhere on Earth in about 90 minutes, a potential breakthrough for military logistics.

          <p>Cars manufactured in China accounted for one in ten new vehicles sold in the United Kingdom in June, marking a significant increase in market share. The growth is driven by the rapid expansion of new Chinese brands like BYD and Omoda, as well as established players like MG. This surge comes as other Western countries, including the US and EU, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. The UK's lack of similar tariffs, combined with the popularity of electric cars, has created a major opportunity for Chinese automakers to expand their presence. (not investment advice)</p>
