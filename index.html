          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, characterizing China's military buildup as an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and urging Asian nations to increase their defense spending. Hegseth stated that the US does not seek to dominate China but will defend its allies and interests in the region, referencing a potential 2027 timeline for China's military readiness to invade Taiwan. China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also encouraged Asian countries to avoid economic dependence on China to prevent Beijing from using it as leverage.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest £1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster the country's defense capabilities and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. This initiative is part of a broader strategic defense review aimed at addressing deficiencies in weapons and munitions production highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The new factories will support the production of over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, including drones and missiles, increasing the UK's munitions spending to £6 billion during this parliament. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up as needed.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including the NHS, defense, and education. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact other unprotected areas, potentially leading to real-terms cuts. The government's commitment to fiscal responsibility and its decision to "front-load" spending in the parliament term will require careful prioritization and potentially difficult decisions. The Spending Review on June 11 is expected to outline departmental budgets for the next three to four years.</p>

While shops can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which have been cited as a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Health experts emphasize that further regulation is needed to address youth vaping effectively, despite vaping being substantially less harmful than smoking.

          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House, following a report by the UN nuclear watchdog indicating Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that he received "elements of a US deal" from his Omani counterpart. The proposal aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program, which the IAEA reports includes a stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged Tehran to accept the deal, emphasizing President Trump's commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.</p>
