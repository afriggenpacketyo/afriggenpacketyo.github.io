          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology doctoral student, has pleaded guilty to the first-degree murders of four University of Idaho students and one count of burglary. This plea is part of an agreement with prosecutors that spares him from the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without parole. The deal, which came just before his trial was set to begin, has elicited mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief and others anger over the lack of a trial. Legal experts note the plea provides a guaranteed conviction and saves the state significant resources, though the motive for the crime may remain unknown.</p>

          <p>A federal jury delivered a split verdict in the trial of Sean Combs, finding him not guilty of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. However, he was convicted on lesser charges, including transportation for the purposes of prostitution. Following the verdict, prosecutors and defense attorneys immediately began debating the potential prison sentence, with the government suggesting four to five years and the defense arguing for around two. Prosecutors are urging the judge to deny bail before sentencing, citing video evidence of assault and arguing he remains a danger and flight risk.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century, helping his team reach 310-5 by the close of the first day of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. Despite England's captain Ben Stokes choosing to bowl first on a flat pitch, India established a solid position, largely thanks to Gill's unflustered performance and an elegant 87 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal. England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, battled hard and took key wickets to prevent India from completely dominating the day. The tourists will be content but recognize there is still significant work to do to secure a commanding first-innings total.</p>

Key evidence includes a spy pen that revealed Suzanne's affair, extensive text messages detailing their troubled marriage, and cell phone data placing Barry at home during the suspected time of the murder. Following the discovery of Suzanne's remains in 2023, Barry Morphew was arrested and charged with her murder for a second time.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is facing intense criticism for its decision to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump regarding edits to a "60 Minutes" interview. Critics, including press freedom advocates and a Democratic FCC Commissioner, have labeled the move a "shameful decision" and a "spineless capitulation" that could embolden attacks on journalists. The settlement, which covers Trump's legal fees and funds for his presidential library, is seen by some as an attempt to appease the administration and secure regulatory approval for Paramount's pending sale to Skydance Media.

While the company cited the need to implement organizational changes and leverage new technologies for success, some analysts are hesitant to attribute the cuts solely to artificial intelligence. D.A. Davison analyst Gil Luria noted that while AI tools increase productivity, the layoffs are also a strategic move to control costs and offset heavy investments in data centers.

However, a significant portion of GOP voters, including some who backed Trump, expressed strong opposition to its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.

          <p>In a single day, the Trump administration has taken several actions that one analyst describes as assaults on liberal democracy, indicative of a trend toward competitive authoritarianism. These moves include threatening to prosecute CNN, suggesting the arrest of a political opponent, and floating financial punishment against Elon Musk for his criticism of a Republican bill. The analysis also points to the appointment of a pardoned January 6th participant to a Justice Department group and the impounding of congressionally approved education funds. These events, combined with the Paramount settlement, are presented as part of a pattern to punish enemies and reward friends, eroding democratic norms.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is ramping up a program to combat the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating maggot that poses a severe threat to livestock, wildlife, and pets. The strategy involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males mate with wild females, whose eggs then fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method, which proved successful decades ago, is being revived after the pest reappeared in southern Mexico, prompting concerns for the American beef industry.</p>

          <p>With the economic landscape shifting, savers with a significant sum like $10,000 should carefully consider their options, such as a certificate of deposit (CD). Before committing funds, it's crucial to determine whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. Savers must also realistically assess if they can afford to have a large amount of money locked away for the entire term, as early withdrawal penalties can be substantial. Finally, one should compare CD rates and terms against high-yield savings and money market accounts, which offer comparable returns with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The case involves a neo-Nazi state agent, where MI5 falsely claimed it had not confirmed his status. The judges commended the BBC for its role in uncovering the issue and stated the new inquiry will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, as MI5's actions had undermined the trust of the courts.</p>

Trump's threats of primary challenges against dissenters could push the GOP further to the right, potentially alienating swing voters in key states like North Carolina and Maine.

          <p>When a credit card issuer closes an account due to extended non-payment, it triggers a cascade of negative financial consequences beyond late fees. The closure immediately damages the cardholder's credit score by increasing their credit utilization ratio and adding a significant negative mark to their report. The outstanding debt does not disappear; it is typically sold to a collection agency, leading to persistent collection efforts and further credit damage. Rebuilding from this event requires addressing the debt through negotiation or a payment plan and systematically working to re-establish a positive credit history over time.

This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections between ancient Egypt and the Fertile Crescent.

          <p>A local official in Burundi reported that six individuals were brutally killed by a militia group after being accused of witchcraft. The attack, which occurred near the economic capital Bujumbura, was allegedly carried out by members of the Imbonerakure, the youth wing of the ruling party. Two of the victims were burned alive, while the others were stoned or beaten to death in what was described as an act of "unspeakable barbarity." Authorities have arrested 12 people in connection with the mob justice, which was reportedly prompted by locals attributing recent unexplained deaths to the victims.</p>
