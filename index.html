          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark discussed her difficult sophomore season, which was limited to just 13 games due to a series of lower-body injuries. Clark detailed her struggles with groin, quad, and a severe ankle sprain, noting that the recovery process was often more demanding than playing. Despite the physical setbacks and personal challenges, she explained that being sidelined provided valuable lessons in leadership and empathy. Clark emphasized that observing from the sidelines allowed her to better understand her teammates and grow as a leader, even while being unable to contribute on the court.</p>

The suspect, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot and killed by police at the scene. Three other people were seriously injured, including one who was accidentally hit by police gunfire during the response to the assault. The incident is being treated as an act of terrorism, prompting condemnations from political leaders and increased security measures at synagogues across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has reached its third day, with the Senate scheduled to vote again on funding measures that have repeatedly failed to pass. Both Republican and Democratic-led bills are on the docket, but with leadership at a stalemate, the shutdown is expected to continue through the weekend. Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated no further votes are likely until Monday, extending the shutdown's potential length. The Trump administration has escalated pressure by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and has already frozen billions in infrastructure funding for projects in Democratic-led areas.</p>

An amber warning for wind is in effect, with gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph in coastal areas, leading to the closure of roads and bridges like the Foyle Bridge. In response to the severe weather, the Education Authority ordered schools in four counties to close early for safety. Local councils have also shut down facilities, and residents are being advised to take precautions against potential flooding and falling trees.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest's new manager, Ange Postecoglou, is facing mounting pressure after failing to secure a victory in his first six matches across all competitions. Despite a recent Europa League loss that prompted chants for his dismissal from some fans, the club's hierarchy reportedly still supports him for now. However, the upcoming Premier League match against Newcastle is considered crucial for his future, with the performance being as important as the result. Postecoglou remains defiant, citing his past success in winning a trophy at Tottenham despite knowing he was facing dismissal.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing hearing for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, prosecutors argued for a harsh sentence, citing what they described as 'staggering' and 'life-altering' violence against his ex-girlfriends. The prosecution contended that Combs only admitted to violence when it was beneficial to him and has not truly accepted responsibility for his actions. Judge Arun Subramanian stated that he does not believe Combs is fully remorseful for his prostitution-related convictions and noted he would consider acquitted conduct as context for sentencing. Combs was found guilty of transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution.</p>

Lydia was wounded while reportedly shielding a younger student from the gunman, who later died by suicide.

This action is the latest in a series of funding freezes targeting Democratic-led cities and states, which critics call politically motivated. Illinois Governor J.B.

          <p>With U.S. home equity reaching a record $17.8 trillion, homeowners have substantial borrowing power, and recent interest rate cuts have made leveraging it more affordable. Among the cheapest options is a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which currently has lower variable interest rates than home equity loans or personal loans. A home equity loan offers the stability of a fixed rate, which can be advantageous in an uncertain economy, and its interest may be tax-deductible. For seniors over 62, a reverse mortgage presents another low-cost method, as repayment is typically deferred until the home is sold. (not investment advice)</p>

During the address at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth railed against 'woke' policies, diversity initiatives, and 'fat generals.' Trump also suggested using the military to address crime in major U.S. cities, framing it as a 'war from within.' While some insiders were relieved that the event did not include a purge of generals, critics described it as a campaign rally that used military leaders as a political prop.</p>

The move, which was first announced by Buffett at the company's annual meeting in May, solidifies Abel's position as the designated heir.

The city will issue 20-year bonds to finance the acquisition, which officials argue is a financially sound move despite the properties' combined assessed value being only $9.5 million. The purchase of the Doorley building for $18.5 million is expected to save the city at least $1.4 million annually by exiting an unfavorable long-term lease. The WaterFire Arts Center will be leased back to its nonprofit group as an investment in local arts and culture.</p>

This marks a notable shift from her past persona, which often sought to balance immense ambition with an approachable, 'nice girl' image. This article suggests that Swift is now more openly integrating her relentless drive and perfectionism into her public identity. In an era of anti-feminist backlash, her willingness to unabashedly celebrate her professional success and ambition represents a powerful statement about female agency and career focus.</p>

          <p>Balin Miller, a 23-year-old accomplished climber from Alaska, died after falling from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. The incident occurred while he was lead rope soloing a difficult route; he had completed the climb and was likely rappelling off the end of his rope while retrieving gear. Miller was a celebrated alpinist known for impressive solo ascents, including a recent climb of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct. His death marks the third fatality in the park this summer, and it occurred on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which has resulted in limited park operations.</p>

State-owned manufacturer Comac had previously set ambitious production targets, aiming to increase capacity by 50% in 2025. However, if these targets are not met, carriers may turn to Boeing, which is not subject to U.S. export restrictions and is ramping up its own production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's £116m summer signing, Florian Wirtz, has had a slow start to his Premier League career, failing to score or assist in his first nine appearances. Tactical analysis suggests manager Arne Slot's new system has required Wirtz to play a deeper role to help with build-up play, reducing his time near the opposition's goal. The increased intensity and reduced space in the Premier League have also been challenging, and his high work rate in pressing may be causing fatigue. For Wirtz to thrive, Liverpool may need to adjust their tactics to better utilize his strengths in carrying the ball forward in transitional moments.</p>
