          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, dubbed "PARC"—that he believes are poised for continued growth driven by strong retail investor enthusiasm. He notes that while these trendy names are not bound by traditional metrics, they possess solid earnings and analyst attention, distinguishing them from more speculative plays. Cramer suggests that investors can profit from these stocks but advises exercising discipline by securing gains when they occur, as he anticipates their rally will persist absent a significant market shift.

          <p>A BBC analysis details how the Trump administration is leveraging the judicial system and a high volume of executive orders to implement its policy agenda, effectively reshaping presidential power. The article highlights an escalating conflict with federal judges, who face public criticism from the administration and a rise in personal threats, creating what some experts call an unprecedented assault on the judiciary. This confrontation, combined with key Supreme Court rulings favoring presidential authority, raises significant questions about the long-term balance of power in the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has formally requested that the Department of Justice investigate Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for what it calls "illegal DEI practices." The complaint alleges that the university uses socioeconomic status as a proxy for race in admissions to circumvent the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action and that its diversity-focused programs are discriminatory. The group is asking the federal government to suspend funding and compel the university to dismantle all programs that consider race as a factor.</p>

          <p>Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. The sentence was delivered despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only one day of prison time, a position that drew outrage from Taylor's family and civil rights advocates. Hankison is the only officer to be convicted and sentenced in direct connection to the raid, which became a focal point of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

Watt's post sarcastically criticized Jones for publicly taking a dig at his star players right before the season. Parsons' endorsement of the critique signals potential friction between the elite pass rusher and the front office as he seeks a new, market-setting contract.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the launch of a new prebiotic cola, set to be released this fall, as it aims to capture the growing market for health-conscious beverages. The new drink, which will come in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, is designed to be a healthier alternative with only five grams of sugar and no artificial sweeteners. This move follows Pepsi's recent acquisition of the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion. It signals a broader strategy by the company to innovate and introduce more functional ingredients to boost lagging traditional soda sales.</p>

A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the marines' presence had sent a clear message that lawlessness would not be tolerated and that their redeployment was ordered as stability has returned to the city.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston court over the government's decision to freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding for the university. The administration claims the cuts are necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge called "mind-boggling" and for which she said the government provided no clear documentation. Harvard argued the move harms vital public research and is an attempt to control the university's internal workings, in a case that could have staggering constitutional consequences.</p>

However, the article advises caution with HELOCs, as their variable rates are subject to change with market conditions, which can alter future payment amounts.
