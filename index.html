          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations, causing its stock to decline in after-hours trading. Despite missing on earnings per share, the company's revenue exceeded forecasts, driven by a 32% year-over-year sales increase. AMD, a major competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market, is facing challenges from U.S. export controls on sales to China, which impacted its revenue. However, the company provided a strong sales outlook for the next quarter, anticipating growth in its AI business as it transitions to new chip generations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Growing trade disputes between the United States and India are jeopardizing a potential visit by President Trump and casting uncertainty on the future of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). The White House is reportedly seeking significant trade concessions from India as a precondition for the presidential trip, which was planned to coincide with a Quad leaders' summit. Without a trade breakthrough, the visit is unlikely, which could weaken the strategic alliance—also including Japan and Australia—that is seen as a key counterweight to China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock price plummeted over 15% following its second-quarter earnings report, which revealed that global average revenue per user (ARPU) missed Wall Street expectations. Although the company's daily active users slightly surpassed forecasts, the weak ARPU figure raised concerns about its monetization capabilities, especially as peers like Reddit have shown strength. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the performance to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy effects. Despite the setback, Snap provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of analyst estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees have officially activated star player Aaron Judge from the injured list as the team aims to end a recent losing streak. Judge, who was sidelined with an elbow flexor strain, will initially return as the designated hitter since he has not yet resumed throwing. His return presents a strategic challenge for managing the lineup, particularly regarding Giancarlo Stanton, who has been performing well as the designated hitter. The team hopes Judge's MVP-caliber performance this season will provide a much-needed boost as they fight for a playoff spot in the American League.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is intensifying its efforts to reduce its dependency on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for electronics, military technology, and green energy. A key part of this strategy involves reviving California's Mountain Pass mine, a site that was once the world's leading source of these minerals but faced closure and bankruptcy. With significant funding from the Department of Defense, the U.S. government aims to rebuild a domestic supply chain for these critical materials. This move reflects a broader geopolitical strategy to secure essential resources and counter China's long-held supremacy in the global market.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has reduced its full-year production forecast after its second-quarter financial results failed to meet Wall Street expectations. The company now expects to produce between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles, down from a previous target of 20,000, citing supply chain constraints and a cautious outlook. Lucid reported a net loss of $855 million for the quarter, and its shares fell in after-hours trading following the announcement. The adjustment reflects broader challenges in the EV market, including slower-than-expected consumer demand and increased competition. (not investment advice)</p>

It asserts that while some specific allegations against the Trump campaign were not proven, the core finding of Russian meddling is well-documented by U.S. intelligence and a GOP-led Senate investigation. The piece argues the "hoax" narrative is a political tool that conflates unproven rumors with the established facts of Russia's interference.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding allegations that Donald Trump's political opponents conspired to falsely link him to Russia during the 2016 campaign. This move follows recent claims by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard of a "coup" against Trump and the declassification of documents suggesting a plan to smear him. The grand jury will determine if formal charges should be filed, though the potential targets and charges are currently unclear. The decision re-ignites the highly polarized debate over the original FBI investigation.</p>

          <h2>Coast Guard Report Finds Titan Submersible Tragedy Was "Preventable"</h2>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was preventable, blaming owner OceanGate for using "intimidation tactics" and exploiting regulatory loopholes to avoid safety scrutiny. The final report states the vessel's design was inadequate and that its hull had been compromised in previous incidents. Investigators identified a "toxic" safety culture, where employees who raised concerns were dismissed, and noted that CEO Stockton Rush's overconfidence led to critical warnings being ignored. The report asserts that OceanGate's actions allowed it to operate completely outside established deep-sea safety protocols.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her appeal is pending. In a court filing, her lawyer stated that the public's interest in Jeffrey Epstein does not justify releasing untested, secret testimony against Maxwell, who is still alive and pursuing legal options. The DOJ has countered that much of the information in the transcripts is already public. The legal battle unfolds as Maxwell challenges her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to enter negotiations with the federal government after the Trump administration froze approximately $339 million in research funding. The grants, supporting work in fields like cancer and neuroscience, were suspended after the administration accused UCLA of violating civil rights laws related to antisemitism and other issues. University officials expressed hope for a resolution but have not ruled out a lawsuit. The move has caused significant uncertainty on campus, with faculty concerned about the future of critical, life-saving scientific projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the legal standing of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's threats to remove Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. While the House Speaker has issued civil arrest warrants, legal experts note that Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction to arrest the legislators outside the state. Furthermore, a 2021 attorney general opinion suggesting removal from office for abandonment is non-binding. The primary legal ways to remove a lawmaker are expulsion by a two-thirds vote of the legislature—which is impossible without a quorum—or by voters in an election.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing to seek hate crime charges and the death penalty against the man accused of killing two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are expected to ask a grand jury to indict Elias Rodriguez on the new charges for the May 21 shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. To secure a hate crime conviction, prosecutors must prove the act was motivated by antisemitism, not just political opposition to Israel. Rodriguez allegedly shouted pro-Palestinian slogans and told police he "did it for Palestine."</p>

          <p>Actor and director Justin Baldoni is suing the insurers of his film "It Ends With Us," alleging they breached their contract by refusing to cover legal costs from a lawsuit filed by his co-star, Blake Lively.

The new lawsuit against the insurance companies marks a significant escalation in the messy legal battle, as Baldoni seeks to compel them to pay for the mounting defense fees.
