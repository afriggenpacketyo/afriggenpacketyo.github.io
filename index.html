          <p>Workday's stock experienced a 9% increase after Elliott Investment Management announced a $2 billion stake in the company.

Elliott praised Workday's CEO, CFO, and team for their progress, highlighting the company's potential for growth and customer retention. Workday recently announced its intent to acquire Paradox, an AI software company for recruiting, but the terms of the deal were not disclosed. (not investment advice)</p>

She detailed a timeline of events, including a meeting where HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. allegedly asked her to preemptively approve vaccine recommendations and fire career officials. Monarez stated she refused, citing her inability to approve recommendations without reviewing evidence and lacking grounds to fire scientific experts. Several Republican senators have expressed concern over Kennedy's handling of vaccines and the CDC, and Kennedy has replaced all the members of the committee with handpicked people, some of whom have expressed criticism of vaccines.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, fashion choices have become a form of diplomacy. Melania Trump wore a wide-brimmed purple hat and a Dior suit, which some analysts interpreted as a message of support for her husband's agenda and American support for Europe. The Princess of Wales wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat, and analysts noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband, the Prince of Wales, who wore a burgundy tie. These sartorial choices highlight the importance of symbolism and messaging in international relations.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama addressed political violence in the United States, calling it "anathema to what it means to be a democratic country" following the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the attacks on Minnesota lawmakers. Obama criticized leaders who responded to Kirk's death with comments that could sow further division, and he praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox for showing how to disagree while maintaining respectful public debate. Obama also said that denouncing political violence doesn't negate the ability to debate the ideas being promoted, even if one disagrees with them. He said that he disagreed with many of Kirk's opinions, including his 2023 claim that Black women including Michelle Obama and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson "do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously" and his belief in the "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama condemned the murder of Charlie Kirk as "horrific" and stressed the importance of Americans being able to disagree respectfully. Obama also acknowledged the shootings of Minnesota state legislators Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman as tragedies. He praised Utah GOP Gov. Spencer Cox for his approach to political adversaries and suggested the Trump administration's desire to target political enemies is part of a larger issue. He said that the role of president is to unify rather than stoke division.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed disappointment over restrictions on selling chips to China amid trade tensions. Huang expects to discuss the issue with President Trump at a state banquet, and China's internet regulator is reportedly banning domestic tech companies from buying an Nvidia chip model tailored for the local market. China is the world's second-biggest AI computing market, and Huang stated the company will continue to be "supportive" of both governments as they "sort through these geopolitical policies". Huang said he hasn't yet spoken to Trump about the latest developments, “but I’ll see him tonight, and he’ll probably ask me. I’ll probably say something similar.”</p>

          <p>A group of 95 members of Congress have condemned Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the arrest of protected immigrants known as Dreamers. The representatives denounced the rise in wrongful detention and deportation of DACA recipients and included examples of such cases. They requested information on the legal authority used to detain DACA recipients and details on the arrests. The representatives said recent enforcement actions go against the spirit of DACA, disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) placed over 10,500 people in solitary confinement between April 2024 and May 2025. The report highlights a spike in the use of solitary confinement under the second Trump administration, with vulnerable individuals, such as those with health problems, being placed in isolation for longer periods. The researchers found that almost three out of four solitary confinement placements were 15 days or longer and that people, on average, were isolated for about a month. The lingering effects of solitary confinement can be disastrous, including “severe and often irreparable psychological and physical consequences”.</p>

          <p>Shanghai has become one of the first cities in mainland China to use an overseas cryptocurrency trading platform to sell seized blockchain tokens. A district-level court partnered with a third-party institution to sell over 90,000 filecoins on a licensed platform in Hong Kong. The proceeds from the sale will be allocated to the national treasury or refunded to the victims, following legal procedures. Handling crypto assets in cases involving Chinese citizens and companies presents new challenges for the judiciary.</p>

The cats roam freely on the campus, providing stress relief to students in a challenging environment.

          <p>Thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City as Israeli troops advance in a major ground offensive. The Hamas-run health ministry reports that al-Rantisi children's hospital was targeted in Israeli attacks, forcing patients to flee, and the Israeli military said it was looking into the report. The Israeli military announced that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground forces. Israel says its aim is to free its hostages and defeat up to 3,000 Hamas fighters in what it describes as the group's "last stronghold", but the offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation.</p>
