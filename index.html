          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced Emil Bove's nomination for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals despite significant controversy and opposition. Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, faces allegations of unethical conduct, including a claim from a Justice Department whistleblower that he suggested defying court orders. The committee meeting grew chaotic as Democrats protested the Republican-led push to vote without allowing all members to speak or considering a motion to delay for whistleblower testimony. Bove's confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain, as he would need near-unanimous Republican support to be approved.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress from both parties set aside political divisions to play in the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, raising money for the Young Survival Coalition, a charity supporting young adults with breast cancer. The "Team Congress" players, which included both Democrats and Republicans, competed against a media team called the "Bad News Babes." Co-founded in 2009 by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor, the event highlights a rare moment of unity on Capitol Hill for a common cause. Over its history, the game has successfully raised nearly $5 million for the charity.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old suspect, Raymond Boodarian, has been charged with two counts of murder for the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found in their Encino home after an intruder allegedly entered through an unlocked door and confronted them upon their return from grocery shopping. Boodarian was also charged with residential burglary and is being held without bail, with his arraignment postponed until August. Investigators utilized security footage and facial recognition to identify the suspect, who was arrested days after the bodies were discovered.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum toured Alcatraz Island as part of the Trump administration's directive to assess its potential for reopening as a federal penitentiary. The plan, announced by the president in May, aims to house the nation's "most ruthless and violent offenders" in a rebuilt facility. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from local officials like San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who highlighted the island's economic importance as a tourist attraction generating millions in revenue. Alcatraz was closed as a prison in 1963 due to high operating costs.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have secured a three-year, $123 million contract extension with star pass rusher T.J. Watt, resolving a period of contract negotiations ahead of the upcoming NFL season. This deal reportedly makes Watt the highest-paid non-quarterback in the history of the league, surpassing the previous record set by Myles Garrett. Watt, the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, had previously skipped mandatory minicamp, signaling his desire for a new contract. The agreement ensures the seven-time Pro Bowler remains a cornerstone of the Steelers' defense for the foreseeable future.</p>

Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, this ancient ice contains trapped dust, volcanic ash, and microscopic algae that can reveal information about temperature, wind patterns, and sea levels from a previously unknown period. The research aims to understand a mysterious climate shift called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. This data could revolutionize climate change models by providing insights into how the planet responds to high levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the cooling, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. However, concerns about economic growth, fueled by potential U.S. tariffs, complicate the central bank's policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors contributing to the tight supply include prolonged drought, high feed costs, and ranchers selling cattle to capitalize on high prices rather than breeding them.

          <p>Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison has pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of "wet reckless driving," avoiding jail time for a DUI citation from July 2024. The former USC star was arrested after a California Highway Patrol officer found him asleep behind the wheel of a Rolls-Royce blocking traffic near LAX. As part of the plea deal, the original misdemeanor drunk-driving charges were dismissed. Addison was sentenced to 12 months of probation and must pay a fine and complete online courses, though the NFL may still impose a suspension under its substance abuse policy.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has responded to criticism from the White House regarding the cost and scope of the Fed's headquarters renovation project. The White House accused Powell of mismanagement and leading an "ostentatious" overhaul, tying it to broader frustration over the Fed's interest rate policy. In a formal letter, Powell defended the project's oversight and budget, refuting claims of luxurious features like private elevators or rooftop gardens and explaining that cost overruns were due to increased material and labor costs. The Fed also launched a public webpage to provide transparency on the multi-year renovation of its aging buildings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing growing pressure from both Democrats and his own supporters to release the complete Justice Department files on Jeffrey Epstein, a demand he has so far resisted. The controversy, fueled by Attorney General Pam Bondi's earlier remarks about a non-existent client list, has put the administration on the defensive. Trump has dismissed calls for transparency as a "hoax" and insulted supporters interested in the case, while publicly known associates like Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew fuel public curiosity.

          <p>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld a controversial congressional map, rejecting a challenge that argued it illegally diminishes the influence of Black voters. The map, pushed by Governor Ron DeSantis, dismantled a North Florida district where Black voters had consistently elected their candidate of choice, a Black Democrat. The court's majority opinion, written by a DeSantis appointee, argued that recreating a similar district would improperly prioritize race over other redistricting criteria. Critics and dissenting justices warned that the decision weakens voter-approved anti-gerrymandering protections and could make it easier to dilute minority voting strength in the future.</p>

Critics argue that by sidestepping the traditional, lengthy appeals process and failing to provide reasoning, the conservative majority is undermining the Court's legitimacy.
