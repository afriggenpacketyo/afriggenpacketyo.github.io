          <p>Donald Trump has announced a news conference to reveal a "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country," leading to speculation that the agreement is with the United Kingdom. Several US media outlets have reported that the US will strike a trade agreement with the UK. This would be the first such agreement since Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, later pausing the levies for 90 days. The UK is also subject to US import taxes on steel, aluminum, and cars, but Washington is reportedly close to similar deals with India and Israel.</p>

The findings are intended to aid in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a proposed China-led research base on the moon.
