            <p>President Trump's renewed attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have exacerbated market instability, causing stocks and the dollar to slide. Trump's call for immediate interest rate cuts to boost the economy has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and the potential for political interference. Investors are reacting negatively to the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and the ongoing trade tensions. The situation is further complicated by Powell's earlier warnings about the potential negative impact of Trump's tariff policies on economic growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn as President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's monetary policy, urging immediate interest rate cuts. This breached a long-standing norm of political independence at the Fed, unsettling investors and leading to a sell-off in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 971 points, and the price of gold surged to a record high as investors sought safe-haven assets. Powell had previously expressed concerns about Trump’s tariff policy, adding to the market's anxiety, as the Fed is stuck between either raising rates to combat tariff-induced inflation or lowering rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a potential slowdown.

            <p>President Trump convened a meeting with top retail executives from Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's to discuss the potential impact of his proposed tariff plans on their businesses. The retailers, heavily reliant on imports, expressed concerns about the potential for increased costs and disruptions to their supply chains. The meeting highlights the growing tension between the administration's trade policies and the retail sector, which is already facing challenges from inflation and changing consumer behavior. All of the attending companies issued nearly identical statements saying they had a 'productive meeting' and 'appreciated the opportunity to share our insights'.</p>

The settlement comes amid a period of financial instability for Walgreens, which has announced plans to close 1,200 stores to cut costs. The settlement amount is based on Walgreens' ability to pay, with the company owing at least $300 million.</p>

Google is pushing back, arguing that the proposed remedies are fundamentally flawed and would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation and also that this would hurt US economy in the global race with China.

            <p>The Trump-Vance inaugural committee raised a staggering $240 million for the second presidential inaugural of President Donald Trump, according to a new FEC filing. The record-breaking amount dwarfs the $107 million raised for Trump's first inaugural in 2017. The biggest donor was Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, followed by crypto company Ripple. The filing discloses contributions from more than 800 donors, but it remains unclear how much of the money was spent on inaugural events.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been convicted of participating in a bribery scheme with her husband, accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car from New Jersey businessmen seeking help with their dealings. The jury found her guilty on all counts in the same courthouse where Bob Menendez was previously convicted. Prosecutors presented evidence of a whirlwind romance between the couple that began in 2018 and continued after criminal charges were filed. Bob Menendez resigned from the Senate following his conviction and is scheduled to begin an 11-year prison term in June.</p>

The company's vice president of regulatory affairs stated that the move would hinder the country's technological leadership at a critical juncture.
