          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has postponed her Las Vegas residency, originally scheduled for December, until September 2026 due to health concerns. The 79-year-old singer stated that her doctors have advised her to undergo "a few procedures," preventing her from having adequate time to rehearse and deliver the quality of show her fans expect. While the specific nature of her health challenges was not disclosed, Parton recently dealt with a kidney stone and infection, though she reassured fans she has no plans to retire from the music business.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States at Bethpage is being credited to the meticulous and statesman-like leadership of captain Luke Donald. He became only the fourth captain to win back-to-back Ryder Cups, fostering a quiet confidence and strong team spirit among his players. Key strategies included flying the team to New York early to acclimate, leveraging deep data analytics with vice-captain Edoardo Molinari, and an intense focus on details to create an environment where his players could succeed. His approach has set a high bar for future European captains.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new government initiative guaranteeing paid work placements for young people who have been unemployed and out of education for 18 months. The plan aims to abolish long-term youth unemployment, but those who refuse a placement without a reasonable excuse could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. This policy builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will be funded from existing budgets, with full details to be revealed in the upcoming November Budget. Business organizations have welcomed the proposal as an important step.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, UK health officials are warning of a seasonal rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases, which present similar symptoms, making them difficult to distinguish. While the flu often arrives suddenly with fever and body aches, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now resemble a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Both viruses can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations, and health authorities are urging eligible individuals to get vaccinated against both to reduce the strain on hospitals and protect the community.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity and high cost of new weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are creating a two-tier system that exacerbates health inequalities. While these drugs show significant effectiveness, strict NHS eligibility criteria and a "postcode lottery" for access mean that over 90% of the 1.5 million UK users pay privately, at costs up to £350 a month. This situation disproportionately affects people in deprived areas, where obesity rates are higher, effectively turning access to crucial obesity treatment into a luxury for the wealthy and raising concerns among health professionals.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new proposals requiring migrants to prove their contribution to society to earn indefinite leave to remain. Under the plan, legal migrants would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and participate in community volunteering to qualify for permanent settlement status. This policy aims to draw a clear distinction with Reform UK's more stringent proposals, which Labour has criticized. Mahmood will argue that fair migration and secure borders are essential for an open and tolerant country.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD is introducing significant discounts in Japan in an effort to boost its sluggish sales in a market dominated by domestic brands like Toyota. Despite opening numerous sales locations, BYD has struggled to attract Japanese consumers, who largely prefer hybrid vehicles. The company is now offering discounts of up to 1 million yen (US$6,700), a strategy that, while successful in China, is risky in Japan as it can alienate early buyers and negatively impact resale values. This move highlights the challenges foreign automakers face in the loyal Japanese market.</p>

The domestic Premiership Women's Rugby league is also set for increased visibility with a new broadcast deal.

          <p>Denmark has temporarily banned all civilian drone flights across the country to enhance security for an upcoming European Union summit in Copenhagen. The transport ministry stated the measure was necessary to simplify police work and prevent foreign drones from causing disruption, following a series of recent unidentified drone sightings over military sites. This action comes as several Nordic and Baltic nations report increased drone activity, prompting 10 EU defense ministers to agree on creating a "drone wall" and NATO to increase its vigilance in the region.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced he is dropping his bid for reelection, citing difficulties in fundraising and constant media speculation about his campaign's future. His withdrawal transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, independent candidate and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' first term was marked by a federal corruption scandal and low poll numbers, and his decision to suspend his campaign came after previously insisting he would remain in the race to challenge his opponents.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new mobile air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea for the first time. This system is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, functioning similarly to Israel's Iron Dome. The deployment is seen as a strategic response to the military capabilities of both North Korea and China. The move follows reports that the U.S. Army was exploring sending prototype defense systems to global hotspots to enhance its protective posture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American shopping malls is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime retail space at more affordable rates. As national chains close stores, rising vacancy rates are prompting landlords to offer more flexible lease terms, including shorter commitments and lower rents, to tenants they previously would have priced out. This trend is allowing service-based businesses, independent retailers, and wellness practitioners to establish a physical presence in high-traffic areas. Experts note this shift helps landlords keep plazas active and supports local economic regeneration.</p>

Meanwhile, Humberto, though forecast to remain offshore, will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.

More than 75,000 people from around the world voted in this year's contest. The kārearea is a threatened species, with only 5,000 to 8,000 individuals remaining due to habitat loss and predation from introduced species. Conservation groups use the competition to highlight the fact that 80% of New Zealand's native birds are at risk and to advocate for greater investment in their protection.</p>
