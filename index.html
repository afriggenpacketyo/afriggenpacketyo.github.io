          <p>A 20-year-old man, identified as Wess Roley, is believed to have deliberately started a fire on Canfield Mountain in Idaho to ambush emergency responders. He fatally shot two firefighters and severely injured a third before apparently taking his own life. According to law enforcement and his family, Roley had once aspired to become a firefighter and had recently been in contact with a fire department about a job. The motive remains unclear, but the attack occurred after an interaction with fire crews regarding his vehicle, in which he was living.</p>

          <p>Officials have identified the two firefighters killed in an ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, as Battalion Chief Frank Harwood and Battalion Chief John Morrison. A third firefighter, engineer Dave Tysdal, was critically injured but is stable after undergoing surgery. The suspect, Wess Roley, allegedly used a shotgun in the attack after luring the crew to a fire he started. The local fire department stated this was an unprecedented event they had never trained for, as the community grapples with the loss of the long-serving first responders.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a major review of its parental leave and pay systems for new parents, encompassing maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stated the system has not been seriously examined in decades and needs modernization. Campaign groups have praised the review, calling the current system one of the worst in the developed world, with paternity leave being particularly ungenerous. The review will address low take-up of shared leave and the financial barriers preventing many fathers from taking time off.</p>

Conversely, the bill offers benefits for others, such as eliminating federal income tax on tips and overtime, which is celebrated by some workers like firefighters.

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has rejected Apple's attempt to have a major antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice dismissed. The lawsuit alleges that Apple illegally monopolizes the smartphone market by creating anticompetitive barriers around its iPhone ecosystem to stifle competition and inflate prices. Judge Xavier Neals ruled that the DOJ's allegations have sufficient merit to proceed to trial, which could begin as late as 2027. This decision marks a significant step in the government's legal challenge to Apple's "walled garden" business model.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has formally requested that 200 of them be returned to California's command. This move comes as the state's wildfire season intensifies, leaving its specialized firefighting unit, Task Force Rattlesnake, critically understaffed. The troops were federalized by the Trump administration to respond to immigration-related unrest, a move Governor Gavin Newsom has legally challenged. Newsom praised the request, urging the president to end the "political theater" and allow the troops to resume their essential firefighting duties.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing stock market trends by favoring companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas over traditional metrics. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their innovative concepts, while penalizing established giants like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas, such as prioritizing stock buybacks. This shift indicates a "story-dominated market" where the potential of individual company narratives is valued more highly than broad macroeconomic indicators like Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical obstacles are a primary reason for declining childhood vaccination rates in the UK, rather than vaccine hesitancy. Experts found that difficulties in booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear information are preventing many parents from getting their children vaccinated. This has contributed to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. The report calls for improved access, such as using NHS apps for booking and expanding vaccination services to overcome these logistical hurdles.</p>

While his focus on chronic disease and challenging the food industry on additives has garnered some praise, his history of promoting health conspiracies and dismantling parts of the CDC raises significant concerns. Critics argue that his actions, such as questioning vaccine safety and fluoride, undermine scientific consensus, even as he brings attention to long-neglected areas of public health.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated in an interview that the company has not yet observed significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including extensive forward-buying of inventory by both Amazon and its third-party sellers before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace, with millions of sellers, means many will absorb costs to gain market share rather than raise prices. This approach has so far helped cushion customers from the direct financial impact of the trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector experienced a downturn following the release of a new draft of the Republican spending bill. The legislation proposes a new tax on solar and wind projects using Chinese components and an abrupt end to essential tax credits for projects after 2027, creating significant uncertainty. Shares of major renewable developer NextEra Energy fell, along with solar companies like Array Technologies and Enphase. Analysts noted the bill creates a "worst case outcome" for the solar and wind industries, compressing project timelines and adding substantial execution risk for developers.

          <p>President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill is moving closer to passage in the Senate, though some Republican senators are expressing "buyer's remorse" over its contents. The legislation, which makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent while making historic cuts to Medicaid, has drawn criticism from within the GOP. Senator Thom Tillis, who announced he will not seek reelection, called the bill a "betrayal" of promises not to cut entitlements. Despite the internal dissent and unified Democratic opposition, Republican leadership is pushing forward to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.</p>

Yardeni attributes this optimistic outlook to the continued resilience of the U.S. economy and diminishing risks from trade tariffs, which have bolstered investor confidence.

The ACLU, representing the migrants, contends the act is meant for major military conflicts, not for addressing gang activity.

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not caused a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies aggressively pre-ordering inventory to "front-load" before the duties took effect. Additionally, many businesses are temporarily absorbing the costs to avoid losing customers and are using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. While these strategies have cushioned the immediate impact, experts warn that prices are still likely to rise later in the year if tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Details How Republican Bill Could Cut Medicaid and Who May Lose Coverage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Republican-backed spending bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion over the next decade, potentially leaving 11.8 million more Americans uninsured. The bill's proposed changes, including new work requirements for many recipients, are a primary driver of the coverage losses. Health policy experts warn these cuts could be devastating for vulnerable populations, particularly older adults, and could force the closure of rural hospitals and community health centers that rely heavily on Medicaid revenue to operate.

          <h2>Stablecoin Issuer Circle Seeks National Bank Charter from US Regulators</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 17:40:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If granted, this would allow Circle to establish a federally regulated bank, the First National Digital Currency Bank, and offer custody services to institutional clients. The move is a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into the traditional financial system and aligns with emerging U.S. regulations for digital currencies. This follows a successful public market debut for Circle, with its stock showing strong performance in June. (not investment advice)</p>
