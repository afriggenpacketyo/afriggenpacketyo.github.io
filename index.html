          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his testimony to Congress five years ago and relate to alleged lying during Senate Judiciary Committee proceedings in 2020. This legal action follows public pressure from President Donald Trump, who has frequently targeted Comey, and involves an interim U.S. Attorney appointed at Trump's direction. Comey denies the charges, asserting his innocence and expressing confidence in the federal judicial system, despite the political context.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Todd West, 50, was executed by nitrogen gas in Alabama for the 1997 murder of Margaret Parrish Berry during a gas station robbery. Despite West's apology to the victim's family and pleas from Berry's son for clemency, Governor Kay Ivey allowed the execution to proceed, upholding Alabama law. West's execution marks one of two carried out in the U.S. that night, and it was Alabama's sixth use of the nitrogen gas method. The victim's son expressed astonishment at the execution and offered condolences to West's loved ones, highlighting a complex perspective on justice.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum to establish a comprehensive strategy for investigating and dismantling organized political violence and domestic terrorism. The initiative targets what Trump calls a 'radical leftwing terror network,' with potential focus on funders like George Soros and Reid Hoffman. Critics, including the ACLU, view the memo as a dangerous move to target political opponents and activists under the guise of combating terrorism, fearing a broad crackdown on dissent. The administration asserts it's an 'all-of-government effort' to address left-wing terrorism, utilizing the FBI's joint terrorism taskforces.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz labeled incidents during President Donald Trump's UN speech, including an escalator malfunction, teleprompter failure, and audio issues, as 'unacceptable.' Waltz suggested the incidents were a deliberate attempt to sabotage the president and vowed to withhold U.S. funding until the UN undergoes sweeping reforms. He criticized the organization's bureaucracy and called for greater transparency and accountability. The U.S. has already withheld its contribution this year, demanding significant changes before resuming payments and addressing perceived operational failures.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is facing questions regarding the role of tech investor Harriet Green in its efforts to cut costs at West Northamptonshire Council. Green, whose firm invests in companies that work with or compete against local government, is seeking access to sensitive council data. Local councillors have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest and whether businesses backed by Green's firm would gain an unfair advantage. Reform UK has not responded to comments, and legal constraints have hampered Doge's data access efforts so far, prompting calls for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged illegal use of nearly half a million pirated books for AI training. The settlement will compensate rights holders approximately $3,000 per book, though it does not cover future works. While the court previously ruled AI training as transformative fair use, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired materials from pirate websites. This landmark agreement is seen as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for intellectual property infringement and ensuring fair compensation.</p>

          <p>California Senate Bill 576, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by a loud commercial, aims to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services. The article seeks to extend federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act protections, which currently apply only to traditional broadcasters, to platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, this legislation could set a national precedent due to California's market influence.

Forecasters anticipate Humberto to strengthen into a hurricane, while the second system is expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda.

Conversely, consumer-oriented industries like autos, housing, and retail are struggling, indicating a need for interest rate cuts to prevent further decline.

          <p>Yang Weimin, a former senior Chinese official, has urged greater efforts to boost household income over the next five years to power China's future economic growth through consumption. His comments come ahead of the Communist Party's Central Committee plenum, where the country's next five-year plan will be discussed. Yang, who helped draft previous plans, emphasized the need to increase the share of household disposable income in national income and consumer spending's share of total demand. This highlights a strategic shift towards domestic consumption as a key economic driver. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities worldwide, including major hubs in the UK and US, are experiencing a 'remarkable' increase in rat populations, dubbed 'Ratmageddon.' Pest control companies report significant spikes in call-outs, with some cities seeing increases of up to 400%. Researchers link this surge to rising global temperatures, particularly warmer winters, which allow rats to breed more frequently. Urbanization, overflowing bins, and increased fast-food consumption also contribute to the problem. Experts suggest that cutting off rats' food sources and improving urban waste management are crucial to controlling these resilient and adaptable rodents.</p>
