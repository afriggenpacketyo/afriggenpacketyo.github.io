          <p>Chicago Cubs legend and Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg has passed away at the age of 65 after a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered as a hero to a generation of Cubs fans, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His career was defined by his exceptional skill at second base and a pivotal 1984 game that became known as the "Ryne Sandberg Game." Following his playing career, he remained a beloved figure and ambassador for the Cubs, with the team unveiling a statue in his honor just last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a significant stock decline, with shares falling over 8% after reporting a 59% drop in first-quarter net profit. The company attributed the sharp decrease to lower interest income and losses from associated companies, specifically citing its 25.1% stake in Air India, which was not factored into the previous year's results. Despite the profit plunge, the airline noted that demand for air travel remains strong. However, analysts have downgraded the stock, citing weaker cargo demand and higher operating costs as concerns for future performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A gunman wearing body armor killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer, and critically injured a fifth person in a shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office building. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, entered the lobby and opened fire before proceeding to an upper floor, where he later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The building, which houses the headquarters for Blackstone and the NFL, was placed on lockdown during the incident. Authorities found additional weapons in the suspect's vehicle and are currently investigating the motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed to challenge a new Trump administration policy that mandates detention without bail for immigrants in the U.S. illegally while they await deportation hearings. This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release on bond for individuals not considered a flight risk or public safety threat. Advocacy groups argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law and violates due process rights, causing irreparable harm to families. The lawsuit highlights cases of long-term residents with strong community ties who are now being indefinitely detained under this directive.</p>

A recent survey indicates that nearly 75% of Germans support applying more pressure on Israel to address the situation. While Germany remains a staunch ally of Israel, the government acknowledges the airlift is a small but necessary step to help civilians in the besieged enclave.</p>

The decision is attributed to ongoing typhoon rehabilitation efforts in Taiwan, regional developments, and new U.S. tariffs.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with President Donald Trump in Scotland is being analyzed as an opportunity to strengthen a crucial, if improbable, political relationship. The meeting, which included discussions on Gaza, provided Starmer with invaluable direct access to the U.S. president. While this offers a chance to align on key issues, it also presents risks, as Starmer must navigate Trump's unpredictable and free-wheeling style. Downing Street views the access as vital for diplomacy, hoping to translate the personal relationship into tangible outcomes for the UK on the world stage.</p>

Their dismissal follows reports of tension over the handling of major investigations into companies like T-Mobile and Capital One. While the official reason cited was insubordination, the firings highlight ongoing debates within the Trump administration about the direction and aggressiveness of its antitrust enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request to play for the University of Southern California this season. Wingfield is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing that disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and a season-ending injury should grant him an additional year of eligibility. The lawsuit claims the denial has cost him a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and the chance to raise his professional profile. This legal action follows similar successful challenges by other athletes against the NCAA's eligibility restrictions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that recent major trade deals, including the one with the European Union, failed to trigger a market rally due to "tariff ennui" and a greater focus on other market-moving events. He argues that investors are preoccupied with this week's Big Tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. According to Cramer, Wall Street has become accustomed to the pattern of President Trump's trade negotiations and is not reacting strongly unless a deal is substantially different. The market's attention will likely remain on domestic economic indicators until these key events have passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel appears skeptical of the Trump administration's arguments defending the legality of indiscriminate immigration sweeps by ICE agents in Southern California. Judges questioned the constitutionality of "roving patrols" that a lower court found to be in violation of the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case centers on whether criteria like race, location, or language can be used as a pretext for immigration enforcement without reasonable suspicion.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump's policy positions, particularly on the Gaza humanitarian crisis, are heavily shaped by what he sees on television rather than intelligence briefings. Trump recently contradicted an ally's claim that there is no starvation in Gaza by citing TV images of hungry children, stating, "you can’t fake that." The author contends that this reliance on television makes the president susceptible to media narratives and manipulation, narrowing his understanding of complex global events.
