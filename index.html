          <p>Louisiana health officials have reported five deaths and at least 26 hospitalizations in 2025 from the flesh-eating bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, a substantial increase over the state's ten-year average. Most cases involved wound exposure to seawater, with infections proliferating in warm coastal waters between May and October. This rise aligns with scientific warnings that link more common Vibrio infections to rising sea surface temperatures associated with the climate crisis. The bacteria can be fatal, with about one in five infected individuals dying, sometimes within two days of becoming ill.</p>

This marks the first in-custody death of an ICE detainee in the county, which initiated a partnership in February to house federal detainees. The incident is currently under investigation by the Nassau County sheriff and is being assessed by the New York state attorney general's office.

          <p>Prominent late-night television hosts have publicly supported Jimmy Kimmel following his suspension by ABC, which came after he made comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart dedicated segments of their shows to defending free speech and satirizing the pressure from the Trump administration. The controversy escalated after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr suggested potential action against the network, and President Trump called for broadcast licenses to be reviewed. The collective response from the comedians has framed the issue as a significant test for freedom of expression in the media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for refusing to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Federal investigators reportedly found no clear evidence that James knowingly committed mortgage fraud in a 2023 home purchase, despite a push from Trump officials to prosecute. The anticipated dismissal is being called a "brazen attack on the rule of law" by James's attorney and has raised concerns within the Justice Department about political retribution. This action is seen as part of a broader pattern of investigations targeting the president's political rivals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the lengthy 85-page filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." Judge Steven Merryday criticized the suit for containing excessive political rhetoric and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on legal claims. However, the judge is allowing Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise amended complaint, limiting it to 40 pages. The original lawsuit targeted the newspaper, four of its reporters, and publisher Penguin Random House over their reporting and a related book about Trump's finances.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its online marketplace was facilitated by relaxed seller vetting processes, which allowed counterfeit and fraudulent products to be sold on its platform. The report details how some third-party vendors used stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create accounts, selling fake items, including potentially dangerous health and beauty products. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly to compete with Amazon, leading to a "Wild West" environment. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened its vetting procedures for sellers in certain categories.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that the Trump administration's recent actions, particularly the pressure leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, reveal a credible pathway toward establishing a competitive authoritarian regime in the United States. The article outlines a four-part process: purging civil servants, targeting dissent in civil society, pressuring corporations to align with the administration, and using this power to create unfair election conditions. The author contends that while these efforts were once haphazard, recent events show a more focused strategy to consolidate power, mirroring tactics used in countries like Hungary, and calls for collective defiance to prevent this outcome.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, in his first public comments since joining the board, stated that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the recent decision to cut rates by a quarter-point, argued for a larger half-point reduction, citing a lack of evidence that tariffs are driving macroeconomically significant price increases. He also suggested that the administration's immigration policies would have a disinflationary effect by easing pressure on shelter prices, putting his views in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee.

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant has regained access to his Bitcoin account on the cryptocurrency exchange after being locked out for years. Durant, who purchased Bitcoin in 2016 when its value was significantly lower, had been unable to resolve the issue through the platform's standard account recovery process. The high-profile case has drawn attention to ongoing customer service challenges at Coinbase, prompting Armstrong to state that the company is putting a "big focus on getting better" at providing user support. The value of Durant's holdings has likely increased substantially since his initial investment.</p>

          <p>An NPR report details how Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr has become a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to pressure media outlets critical of the president. Carr's recent threats to review broadcast licenses, which preceded ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, are presented as the latest in a series of actions targeting networks like ABC, CBS, NPR, and PBS. The article highlights Carr's shift from a defender of robust discourse to a regulator using the FCC's power to investigate and potentially punish media companies for their political speech, raising significant concerns about free speech and government overreach.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of facilitating illegal ticket reselling. The complaint alleges that the companies allowed brokers to acquire large quantities of tickets, which were then resold at inflated prices, and used deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics. The lawsuit claims that while Ticketmaster publicly opposes brokers, its business model privately benefits from them. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the Labour government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, stating the policy change is "on the table." The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. This issue has become a central point in the Labour deputy leadership contest between Phillipson and rival Lucy Powell, both of whom view removing the cap as crucial for tackling child poverty. Research from the Resolution Foundation suggests that axing the policy would lift approximately 470,000 children out of poverty.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent state visit to the UK examines whether the British government's strategy of flattery and pageantry yielded tangible diplomatic results. While the visit avoided major confrontations and secured some alignment on tech and finance, it failed to produce breakthroughs on key issues like the war in Ukraine or the removal of U.S. steel tariffs. Experts suggest that while such a strategy can prevent public criticism from Trump, it may not effectively influence his policy decisions. The visit serves as a reminder to European nations that relying on unconditional U.S. support is no longer a viable strategy.</p>
