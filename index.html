          <p>Tesla stock rebounded by approximately 5% following a $152 billion drop in market capitalization fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. Analysts cited a report that Trump scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce, though a White House official denied any interest in a call. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla shares are oversold and that reconciliation between Musk and Trump would benefit the stock. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a war of words between the two figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump and President Xi Jinping had a "very positive" 90-minute phone call, signaling a potential cooling of US-China tensions over tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will lead future negotiations with China. Observers note a shift in Washington's approach, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for personal deal-making, while the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio from preparations and announcements suggests a diminished role in shaping bilateral ties. Direct engagements between leaders previously involved top diplomats, but this call reflects a new dynamic in US-China relations.</p>

          <p>A House Republican megabill proposes cuts to Medicaid and changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that could result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage. The bill introduces new work requirements for Medicaid eligibility, potentially affecting individuals aged 19 to 64. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that these requirements could cause 5.2 million adults to lose Medicaid coverage, increasing the number of uninsured by 4.8 million. The proposal also includes changes to state Medicaid funding and the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies, adding further challenges to healthcare access. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that the ban is based on prejudice rather than genuine security concerns, citing data showing that visa overstays from some banned countries are lower than those from allied nations. The policy has been condemned by immigrant advocacy organizations, who view it as a moral disgrace that alienates allies and undermines American values.</p>

          <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) is undergoing significant changes, including staff reductions and integration into a new entity called the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA) under Health Secretary Robert F.

Critics fear the changes could undermine recent progress in addressing overdose deaths and providing community-based mental health services.

          <p>Experts predict that artificial intelligence (AI) could disrupt entry-level jobs for college graduates, potentially eliminating positions or reshaping them. The rise of AI-fueled chatbots and automation may lead to companies cutting entry-level jobs in white-collar fields like computer programming and law. While some analysts attribute current job woes to economic conditions and tariff policies, they acknowledge that AI poses a serious risk to traditional career paths. Some suggest that graduates may need to adapt and acquire skills in AI to remain competitive in the job market.</p>
