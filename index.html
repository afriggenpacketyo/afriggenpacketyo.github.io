          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reportedly conducted a large-scale operation targeting four Russian military airfields, claiming to have hit over 40 military aircraft involved in bombing Ukrainian cities. The operation, planned for over a year and a half, involved drones concealed in makeshift mobile houses with retractable roofs. Simultaneously, railway bridges in Russia's Bryansk and Kursk regions collapsed, derailing trains and causing casualties, with accusations of Ukrainian involvement. The Ukrainian air force reported a massive Russian aerial attack with drones and missiles, while Ukrainian intelligence claimed responsibility for an explosion on a railway in occupied southern Ukraine. The operation was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Optimism surrounding the situation is relatively low given the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed strong confidence that courts will support President Trump's tariff agenda, despite a recent federal court setback. Hassett stated that the administration expects its "Plan A" to succeed, referring to the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact tariffs. He argued that the tariffs are necessary to address the national emergency posed by fentanyl deaths. An appeals court temporarily stayed a lower court's decision that had blocked the tariffs, shifting the burden of proof to the government to demonstrate "irreparable harm" if the injunction remains in place (not investment advice).</p>

Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has also increased its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries.

          <p>An Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip resulted in the deaths of more than 30 Palestinians and injuries to many others, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses claimed Israeli forces fired on crowds near an aid site in Rafah, though the Israeli military denied targeting civilians. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) reported delivering aid without incident and dismissed reports of chaos around its sites. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas faltered, with both sides blaming each other for the lack of progress.</p>
