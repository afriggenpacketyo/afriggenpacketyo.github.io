          <p>This article explores the ways in which falling share prices can impact individuals, even those who don't directly invest in the stock market. It explains that many people have pension funds that are invested in the markets, and a downturn can affect the value of those savings. The article also addresses the impact on those nearing retirement, as well as the potential risk to jobs if share prices remain low for an extended period. Finally, it touches on the influence of market fluctuations on mortgage and interest rates, offering a comprehensive overview of the ripple effects of stock market performance.

          <p>The UK government is adjusting its electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to provide relief to the car industry, which is facing new trade tariffs imposed by the United States. While the ban on new petrol and diesel car production remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will have increased flexibility in meeting annual targets and will face reduced fines for non-compliance. These changes are intended to support the industry amidst the challenges posed by the US tariffs, but opposition parties have criticized the measures as insufficient to significantly boost the car industry.</p>

The settlement also proposes roster limits and a third-party clearinghouse for marketing deals. This move represents a significant shift away from the tradition of amateurism in college sports, driven by the increasing commercialization and lucrative broadcast deals.</p>

          <p>UAW President Shawn Fain expresses support for President Trump's tariffs on the auto industry, despite disagreeing with many of Trump's other policies. Fain argues that these tariffs address a long-standing issue of manufacturing jobs disappearing from the U.S. and doesn't care about the stock market's decline, prioritizing the livelihoods of working-class people. Fain also acknowledges that tariffs may raise prices but views them as a way to prevent exploitation of workers through cheap labor.</p>
