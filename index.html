The continued legislative deadlock between Republicans and Democrats prolongs the partial closure of federal agencies and the disruption of government services. This ongoing failure to reach a consensus highlights the deep partisan divisions preventing a resolution to the fiscal impasse affecting thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>The UK government has published key witness statements related to the collapsed spying case against two men accused of working for China. The documents reveal a deputy national security adviser warned of "large scale espionage" by China in 2023, yet the case was dropped, reportedly because the evidence did not meet the prosecution's threshold. The release follows accusations of a cover-up and raises questions about the government's handling of national security threats.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted Jonathan Rinderknecht on charges of starting the Palisades Fire, a devastating blaze that killed 12 people in Los Angeles County. The indictment includes three counts, adding two new charges and increasing his potential prison sentence to 45 years.

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application is already causing significant disruption for small businesses and tech startups seeking skilled foreign workers. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the high cost is slowing hiring and shrinking the available talent pool, particularly for highly specialized roles in fields like AI. While the policy may encourage upskilling the domestic workforce, critics worry it will hinder innovation by making it prohibitive for new companies.</p>

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a novel solution to the costly and controversial use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The plan involves the government funding councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would then be used for social housing tenants, freeing up their previous homes for asylum seekers. This approach could drastically cut costs and increase the nation's social housing stock, though it faces political and logistical challenges.</p>

J&J denies the allegations, stating its talc products were safe and did not cause cancer, in a case that could become one of Britain's largest product liability lawsuits.</p>
