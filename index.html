        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, a top immigration official and the president's former "border czar." The probe began after Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents in exchange for promises of government contracts. The White House has denied Homan accepted the money and described the investigation as politically motivated entrapment by the previous administration's Department of Justice. The article frames the closure as part of a pattern of politicization within the DOJ under President Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced highly contentious conclusions suggesting a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, by pregnant women. President Trump, alongside Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urged pregnant women to limit the medication's use, a claim that is strongly contested by the international scientific community. The announcement also included plans for research into a potential autism treatment and changes to vaccine schedules, drawing immediate and scathing criticism from medical experts and organizations who labeled the claims as unsubstantiated fearmongering.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A closer look at the scientific evidence behind the Trump administration's announcement linking Tylenol to autism reveals the claims are based on mixed and limited data. While some small observational studies have suggested an association, they cannot prove causation and struggle to account for confounding factors like the underlying fever being treated. A much larger, more robust 2024 study of 2.5 million children in Sweden found no such link, a finding many scientists consider more definitive. Experts express alarm that the administration's guidance outpaces the science, potentially causing undue fear and undermining public health recommendations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to television, nearly a week after the show was indefinitely suspended. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which drew criticism from the FCC chairman and led major affiliate owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to pull the show. Disney stated the suspension was to avoid inflaming tensions but decided to reinstate the program after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The decision had sparked a significant debate about free speech and corporate responsibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for initial H-1B visa applications is causing confusion and concern among immigration attorneys and tech companies. The policy, intended to encourage hiring American workers, applies to new applicants and went into effect on September 21. While the White House clarified it does not affect current visa holders or renewals, legal experts point to gray areas, such as whether a current visa holder who travels abroad after filing for an extension could be subject to the fee upon re-entry. Immigration lawyers are currently advising H-1B employees to avoid international travel until further guidance is issued.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which offers wealthy foreigners a fast track to permanent residency. In exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," applicants can receive an employment-based visa, historically reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." This pay-to-play system differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa program by not requiring direct investment into American businesses, with President Trump suggesting the funds will "generally" be used to pay down national debt. The program signals a shift in immigration policy, prioritizing personal wealth as a primary qualifier.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is implementing a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths from missed diagnoses. The initiative aims to make this best practice standard across the country, particularly helping younger patients whose serious illnesses are sometimes overlooked.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to furlough approximately 1,800 flight attendants, about one-third of its cabin crew, starting December 1. The decision is part of the airline's effort to cut costs and rightsize its operations as it navigates its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the past year. The company's Chief Operating Officer stated that the move is a necessary volume-based adjustment due to significant reductions in the airline's fleet and flight schedule. The flight attendants' union confirmed that the company will first offer voluntary furloughs before implementing involuntary ones later this year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 16:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether to overturn a 90-year-old legal precedent that protects officials at independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The decision came as the court's conservative majority allowed President Trump's removal of a Democratic appointee at the Federal Trade Commission to proceed. This move signals a potential major shift in presidential power, which could undermine the independence of agencies like the Federal Reserve and others designed to be insulated from direct political control. The court will hear arguments in December on the case, which challenges the 1935 ruling of Humphrey's Executor v. United States.</p>

          <p>The man accused of firing shots at an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento reportedly left a note citing the government's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case as a motive. According to a federal court filing, the note found in Anibal Hernandez-Santana's car read "For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags" and also mentioned that several high-ranking Trump administration officials were "next." The District Attorney described the attack as "politically motivated," noting it coincided with a planned protest over the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. Hernandez-Santana, a retired lobbyist, now faces multiple federal and state charges for the attack, in which no one was injured.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old man charged with misdemeanor assault for swinging a pipe at protesters in a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA last year has been granted diversion, allowing him to avoid jail time. A judge cited the man's age and lack of criminal history in the decision, which was made over the objection of prosecutors. As part of the diversion agreement, he must complete 50 hours of community service, participate in anti-bias training, and stay away from the UCLA campus. The case appears to be the last of the criminal proceedings related to the violent attack on the student encampment in May 2024.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man on trial for the attempted assassination of President Trump at his Florida golf club, has rested his case without taking the stand to testify. Routh, who is representing himself, concluded his defense after calling only three witnesses. Prosecutors allege that Routh spent weeks plotting the attack before being spotted by a Secret Service agent, at whom he allegedly aimed his rifle before fleeing without firing a shot. A firearms expert called by Routh testified that the suspect's rifle was prone to jamming and had a poorly mounted scope, suggesting it may have been ineffective.</p>
