          <p>China is initiating recruitment programs aimed at attracting Chinese-born researchers currently working in the United States, offering competitive postdoctoral positions with salaries approaching $100,000 per year for three years. This initiative comes amid funding cuts and perceived declining academic freedom in the US, particularly following Donald Trump's return to the White House. The offers are designed to appeal to researchers considering returning to China due to financial and political challenges in the US, with some scientists already making moves to finalize their decisions. The programs reflect China's effort to bolster its scientific capabilities by leveraging talent abroad.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing internal divisions over a megabill encompassing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, particularly concerning the proposed Medicaid overhaul. Hardliners are demanding changes to the Medicaid plan, criticizing work requirements that won't take effect until 2029 and more frequent eligibility checks. Some Republicans have voiced concerns about the plan's effectiveness in stopping waste, fraud, and abuse, while others worry about legalizing Medicaid for undocumented immigrants at a higher federal match rate. The debate highlights the challenges Speaker Mike Johnson faces in uniting his conference around the reconciliation package, with potential defections threatening the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>Despite recent tariff reductions agreed upon between Washington and Beijing, the costs of broad-based tariffs on Chinese imports remain too high for US sectors like soybean farmers, according to the American Soybean Association. While the US tariffs on Chinese imports were lowered to 30 per cent, and Chinese tariffs on US imports were cut to 10 per cent, US soybeans exported to China still face levies of 34 per cent. The president of the American Soybean Association told a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee that while US soybean farmers have searched for years for alternatives to the Chinese market, it could not be completely replaced given the ‚Äúsheer volume‚Äù of its demand.</p>

          <p>Anti-abortion activists are launching a coordinated campaign called ‚ÄúRolling Thunder‚Äù to pressure the FDA to reinstate restrictions on mifepristone, a common drug used in abortions.

Activists are relying on a new report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, which reproductive health experts dispute. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals, abortion rights experts believe the DOJ's recent move is an effort to protect its ability to restrict mifepristone in the future.</p>

Dlamini, who grew up under apartheid, says that these are people who simply do not want to live under majority-Black rule. Trump's policy is seen as evidence of white supremacist underpinnings, with the administration punishing those who need help while favoring a privileged group. He said that the single biggest mistake that the ANC made at the moment of transition in 1994 was to assume that all that you needed to do to correct the injustices of apartheid was to create a Black capitalist class.</p>
