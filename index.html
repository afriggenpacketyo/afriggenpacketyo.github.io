          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a highly anticipated match at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was more tactical than their previous encounters, concluded with a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. While Serrano had moments of success, Taylor's strategic boxing and strong finish secured the win in what was a historic all-female card at the iconic venue. Both fighters expressed immense respect for each other following the conclusion of their epic rivalry.</p>

          <p>A property developer has been engaged in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over a luxury penthouse on Park Lane. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, poor refurbishment, and the 'malicious' use of a noisy lift to disturb sleep. This conflict highlights the combative business practices associated with the Al Fayed empire. The article also notes that the BBC previously reported on allegations from 13 women who said Fayed sexually assaulted them in a neighboring building, with four of them stating they were sexually assaulted.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs, which created a deficit the Dodgers' potent offense couldn't fully overcome. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run into McCovey's Cove, but it wasn't enough to counter the Giants' strong performance, which included key hits from Jung Hoo Lee and Willy Adames. The loss marks the Dodgers' longest losing streak since 2017 and narrows their division lead to four games.</p>

          <p>A fugitive, Sedrick T. Stevenson, who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May, has been recaptured and returned to Kentucky. The Warren County Sheriff's Office released photos showing a broadly smiling Stevenson on the return flight, escorted by multiple law enforcement officers under heightened security. Stevenson had been on the run for over a month after slipping away from a contracted agent at a ticket counter. He was being extradited to Kentucky to face multiple charges, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and assault.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah amounts to creating a concentration camp and would be a crime against humanity. The author contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba, and that institutions like the ICC have been ineffective in holding Israel accountable. The writer suggests that true accountability will come not from legal systems but from the emergence of truth about Palestinian suffering and resilience. The piece concludes that despite the destruction, Palestinians' connection to their land will ensure their survival.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian officials, ceasefire and hostage release negotiations between Israel and Hamas are close to breaking down. The officials claim Israel's delegation in Doha lacked the authority to negotiate key issues, such as troop withdrawals and aid distribution, effectively stalling the process. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel showing its intent to maintain deep buffer zones inside Gaza, which Hamas viewed as a bad-faith maneuver. Without significant US intervention to pressure Israel for concessions, mediators warn that the talks could fail entirely, worsening the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration arrests in several California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups alleging that federal agents used unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests, particularly targeting Latino communities. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that stops based solely on factors like race or location are unconstitutional. The decision follows recent clashes between protesters and agents during raids, and President Trump has since authorized officers to arrest anyone they believe is assaulting them.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a U.S. federal court. Prosecutors accused Guzman Lopez of taking over a leadership role in the Sinaloa Cartel after his father's extradition and conviction. As part of his plea deal, he admitted to coordinating the transport of vast quantities of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl into the U.S. and agreed to forfeit $80 million. In exchange for his full cooperation, he will receive a reduced sentence.</p>

          <p>A ten-year-old song by the band Lord Huron, 'The Night We Met,' has achieved massive, unexpected success, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. Originally the final track on their 2015 album, the song gained initial traction after being featured in the Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed on social media platforms like TikTok, where its wistful lyrics about a soured relationship have resonated with millions. The song's slow-burning success is a rare phenomenon for a track that was not a hit upon its initial release.</p>

          <p>British soft toy company Jellycat is facing criticism after abruptly terminating its supply agreements with around 100 independent UK shops, many of which had stocked the brand for decades. Shop owners received a generic email stating the decision was part of a 'brand elevation strategy' and was final. The move has devastated small business owners who relied on the popular toys for a significant portion of their income, especially after the brand's recent surge in popularity on TikTok. Customers and collectors have flooded the company's social media with negative comments, criticizing Jellycat for abandoning the small retailers who helped build its success.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has advised residents to stay indoors and avoid going out unless necessary due to ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the region. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas urged the community to remain calm and know their rights, reflecting the heightened fear that has gripped Southern California's immigrant communities. This local warning comes as the Trump administration has intensified its crackdown, targeting businesses and public spaces. The guidance follows a similar advisory from a Catholic bishop in the area who told parishioners they could stay home from Sunday Mass for safety.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle Prague's historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge has ignited a fierce debate between modernization and heritage preservation. The authority argues that the corroded bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and must be replaced with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of international experts and local campaigners insists the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. They propose building a second, slender bridge alongside the original to add the third track, a solution endorsed by UNESCO.</p>

The project, championed by leader Kim Jong Un, is part of an effort to boost the country's sanctioned economy and strengthen ties with Russia. However, the resort's rapid construction has drawn severe criticism from human rights groups and the UN, who cite reports of forced labor and brutal working conditions for the 'shock brigades' used to build it. Former residents also allege they were displaced from their homes without compensation to make way for the development.</p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing high concern over an intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea, where surface temperatures have exceeded 30°C, up to seven degrees above normal for the time of year. This extreme heat, which arrived much earlier than usual, poses a potentially devastating threat to marine life, including vital seaweeds and seagrasses that act as crucial habitats. Experts warn that such events, driven by climate change, can lead to mass mortality of marine species, disrupt ecosystems, and have knock-on effects on fisheries. The Mediterranean is considered a 'climate change hotspot' due to its vulnerability.</p>

The Office of Management and Budget claims the renovation plans include luxury features and may not have proper approval, which Powell has denied in Senate testimony.
