          <h2>Meta Faces Potential $7 Billion Revenue Loss Due to Trump's China Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 15:52:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decrease by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein. These retailers, significant contributors to Meta's $18.35 billion China revenue in 2024, might reduce their Facebook and Instagram ad spending amid the trade dispute. Analysts at MoffettNathanson suggest a prolonged economic downturn coupled with trade tensions could further reduce Meta's advertising revenues by $23 billion, impacting earnings by 25%. Meta's stock has already dropped approximately 19% since Trump's second inauguration, and analysts have decreased their target price for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has exceeded $90,000 for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking alternatives to turbulent stock markets and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's rise coincides with President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. Bitcoin's recent decoupling from risk assets suggests resilience amid economic uncertainty, although analysts caution that breaking the $93,000 resistance level requires a substantial catalyst.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth convened a Justice Department task force to investigate claims of anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration.

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has completed 500 days in office, marked by radical pro-market reforms. While some economists see him as liberating Argentina from bureaucracy, others criticize his policies. Milei ended currency controls, leading to peso stabilization and decreased inflation. However, critics point to cuts in wages, education, and public infrastructure. The long-term impact of Milei's reforms on Argentina's prosperity remains uncertain.</p>
