          <p>A trial regarding the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles concluded, with U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer expressing significant skepticism about the Justice Department's arguments. The lawsuit, brought by California Governor Gavin Newsom, challenged the Trump administration's use of troops for immigration enforcement, citing the Posse Comitatus Act. Judge Breyer questioned the apparent lack of limits on a national police force and the federal government's assertion of immunity. The state seeks an injunction to restrict military involvement to federal property protection, calling the current operations an "unlawful military crusade."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump plans to deploy federalized National Guard troops along the National Mall in Washington D.C., aiming to create a visible military presence to address crime. This extraordinary measure, typically reserved for major crises like inaugurations or the Jan. 6 riots, raises questions about its purpose beyond a display of force. Army officials stated their mission is logistics, transportation, and administrative support for local law enforcement, emphasizing visibility around monuments. This initiative follows Trump's declaration that crime in D.C. is "out of control," despite conflicting local crime data.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe against an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades concluded with questions lingering about its oversight. The plaintiffs argue that the facility, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," was constructed without proper environmental assessment, violating federal law and harming protected species like Florida panthers and bonneted bats. Lawyers for Florida and the Trump administration claim federal law doesn't apply, asserting state control. The judge expressed perplexity over the jurisdictional ambiguity, as the legal process continues while operations at the center persist.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to expedite environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as a hindrance to investment and innovation in the US space market. This move could particularly benefit private space companies like SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, which has faced scrutiny over environmental impact studies and licensing delays. Environmental groups have criticized the deregulation, warning of increased risks to people and wildlife from private rocket launches.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American man who faked his death and fled to the UK to avoid charges, has been found guilty of one count of sexual assault in Utah.

Rossi, who appeared in court in a wheelchair, will face sentencing in October for this conviction and is set for another trial in September for the second sexual assault charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks. Younger generations, particularly those aged 18 to 34, show a greater belief that even moderate drinking is harmful, contributing to the decline. The shift is also attributed to the growing social acceptability of not drinking, the popularity of sober challenges, and the rising cost of alcohol. While women's alcohol use has seen a more significant drop than men's, marijuana use remains relatively steady.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to relax environmental rules for commercial space companies, aiming to substantially increase rocket launches by 2030. The order may allow companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin to bypass environmental reviews mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Environmental groups criticize this move, warning it puts people and wildlife at risk due to the disruptive nature of launches, which can cause habitat destruction, fires, and hazardous spills. This deregulation follows a lawsuit against SpaceX for alleged NEPA violations related to a Starship rocket launch that damaged its launchpad and surrounding environment.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, ahead of the upcoming summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Starmer emphasized the need to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity and ensure any ceasefire is lasting with security guarantees. He praised Trump's efforts to achieve an agreement, noting that the conflict has not seen such a prospect for years. European leaders, including Starmer, held virtual meetings to align their position and reiterate support for Ukraine's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is pursuing extended powers over Washington D.C.'s police department, aiming for a longer-term takeover beyond the initial 30-day statutory limit. This move would require Congressional permission or an declaration of national emergency. Trump cited the need for a "crime bill" pertaining initially to D.C. This initiative follows his recent deployment of the National Guard to the city, which has been met with strong opposition from Mayor Muriel Bowser. The president's intent signals a significant shift in federal-local power dynamics regarding urban policing.</p>

Tindall was arrested on felony charges related to illegal psilocybin mushroom sales.

Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, explaining the rabbits suffer from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease. Spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact, the growths typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems fight the virus. The illness, which does not transmit to humans or other common pets, is believed to have inspired the mythical "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

          <p>Rising energy costs are making it increasingly difficult for low-income Americans, like Dallas resident Angela Harmon, to afford air conditioning, forcing them to seek relief elsewhere. The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which assists millions, faces elimination under President Trump's proposed budget, with the White House citing fraud concerns. Research from Texas A&M University indicates that climate change is directly contributing to higher electricity costs, with wholesale prices increasing significantly in various regions.

          <p>Scientists at Imperial College London warn that UK cities are increasingly vulnerable to "firewaves"—multiple urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather—due to climate change. Recent heath fires in London and Edinburgh highlight this emerging threat, as vegetation becomes highly flammable after extended dry spells. Professor Guillermo Rein's research, in collaboration with the London Fire Brigade, identifies key factors like "vapour pressure deficit" that predict wildfire outbreaks. The LFB is adapting with new technologies like drones and off-road vehicles, while researchers propose adopting "firewave" as an official term to inform public safety strategies.</p>
