          <p>Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have settled a multi-billion dollar lawsuit brought by shareholders concerning the company's handling of the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The lawsuit alleged that executives, including Zuckerberg, failed to protect user data, leading to significant financial repercussions for Meta, including over $8 billion in fines and legal costs. The settlement was reached just one day into the trial in a Delaware court, though the final settlement amount has not been disclosed. The case involved several high-profile defendants, including Peter Thiel and former White House chief of staff Jeffrey Zients.</p>

          <p>Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Governor reportedly being considered by Donald Trump to lead the institution, has called for a "regime change" in the central bank's policy conduct. In a CNBC interview, Warsh criticized the current Fed leadership's hesitancy to cut interest rates and suggested a new accord with the Treasury Department to manage national debt more effectively. His comments align with Trump's public pressure on the Fed for rate cuts, signaling a potential shift towards a more politically influenced monetary policy. Warsh's proposals indicate a significant departure from the current operational framework under Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant number of human rights leaders, journalists, and civil society members are fleeing El Salvador, fearing imprisonment under President Nayib Bukele's government. This exodus, the largest since the country's civil war, comes as Bukele intensifies his crackdown on dissent, using a sweeping anti-gang campaign to justify the suspension of civil liberties and the jailing of critics. Prominent rights group Cristosal has suspended its operations and moved its staff out of the country, citing a lack of impartial institutions and direct persecution. This situation places El Salvador alongside other authoritarian Latin American nations where critics face a choice between exile and prison.</p>

The visit occurs amidst criticism from Democrats about the project's cost and feasibility. In a separate development, Michael Flynn, a staunch Trump supporter, publicly urged the president to be more transparent regarding the Jeffrey Epstein controversy, which Trump has labeled a "hoax." The update also notes the Senate's narrow approval of a $9 billion budget rescission bill, which targets funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting.</p>

The article notes that while the long-term outlook for the power generation company remains bright, especially due to AI-driven energy demand, the short-term risk of a post-earnings sell-off prompted the tactical trim.

Furthermore, patients from the poorest communities and those of Asian backgrounds are more likely to wait longer than 18 weeks for care.

The agency contends this delay allowed Musk to purchase shares at a lower price, saving him at least $150 million. The SEC is seeking disgorgement of these gains and a civil penalty, while Musk's legal team has previously dismissed the lawsuit as a "sham."</p>

The research indicates this disparity is not due to unequal pay for the same work but rather stems from structural barriers that limit migrants' access to higher-paying industries and roles. The wage gap persists into the second generation at 7.7%, which is higher than the international average.

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), is experiencing its most significant crisis in 30 years, plagued by chronic delays, cancellations, and failing infrastructure. With only 62% of trains now considered punctual, the state-owned company is struggling with an outdated network suffering from decades of underinvestment. A massive general refurbishment program has been launched, but it is already facing soaring costs and extended timelines, with a major line closure between Berlin and Hamburg set to cause further disruption. The German government's Federal Audit Office has criticized the management and called for structural reforms beyond just financial investment.</p>

          <p>The city of Minot, North Dakota, is engaged in an escalating battle against a massive population of Richardson's ground squirrels. These small, native rodents have become a significant nuisance, with their extensive burrowing causing damage to sidewalks, lawns, and building foundations throughout the city. The squirrel population has grown dramatically in recent years, likely outnumbering the city's nearly 50,000 human residents. Despite efforts led by pest control professionals using traps and other methods, officials acknowledge that complete eradication is impossible and the goal is simply to manage and reduce the overwhelming numbers of the prolific creatures.</p>
