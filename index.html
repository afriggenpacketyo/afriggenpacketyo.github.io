          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced the construction of a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House's East Wing, a project estimated to cost around $200 million. According to the White House, the new facility will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, addressing the need for a larger space for major state functions. The project aims to provide a permanent, elegant venue with a capacity for 650 guests, eliminating the need for temporary tents. Construction is scheduled to begin in September, with assurances that it will respect the historical architecture of the existing building.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, has expressed grave concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza, stating it is "beyond imagination" and warning that Israel risks international isolation. During a visit to the region, he urged Israel to allow sufficient aid into the territory and to demonstrate it is not pursuing a policy of expulsion or annexation. The article also covers several related developments, including a planned visit to Gaza by a U.S. special envoy, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, and U.S. sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials for undermining peace efforts.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, South Carolina's Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette announced a proposal to create the "Palmetto Pen," a secure prison facility designed to detain violent undocumented immigrants. Citing inspiration from President Trump's policies, Evette states the goal is to enhance public safety and prevent South Carolina from becoming a sanctuary state. The proposed facility would be built in an isolated location, potentially using former correctional facilities, and would be funded in collaboration with the federal government. This initiative is presented as a measure to support law enforcement and deter illegal immigration.</p>

The Israeli foreign ministry denied the claims, stating the passenger violently resisted in a planned provocation, a charge the coalition disputes.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that recent changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could create significant financial barriers for students pursuing professional degrees. The new law caps federal loans for professional schools at $50,000 per year, which is insufficient to cover tuition and living expenses at many medical, law, and dental schools. The author contends this will disproportionately affect working-class students, potentially worsening shortages of doctors, lawyers, and other essential professionals, and urges California to create state-level loan programs to fill the gap.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. While this figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates, the growth rate trailed that of its main competitors, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, which grew at 39% and 32% respectively. Despite slower growth, AWS remains a major profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income. The results highlight the intensifying competition in the cloud market as all three giants invest heavily in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell proposes that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor through a hybridization event approximately 9 million years ago. Researchers analyzed hundreds of potato genomes and discovered that the potato's ability to form starch-rich tubers comes from a combination of genes from two different sources. A crucial gene from an ancient tomato species tells the plant to create tubers, while a gene from a wild, non-tuber-producing potato relative from Chile helps control their growth, solving a long-standing botanical mystery.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, wearable cooling devices, particularly horseshoe-shaped fans worn around the neck, are growing in popularity. This article examines the effectiveness of these personal gadgets in providing relief from the heat. It explores how the fans work by creating a localized breeze to aid in evaporative cooling from the skin's surface. While they can offer a sense of comfort and some minor cooling effect, their overall ability to significantly lower core body temperature in extreme heat conditions is limited compared to more traditional methods like air conditioning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay traces the origins of the modern attention economy back to the rise of the cheap, daily newspaper in the 19th century. It argues that the constant churn of news, scandal, and sensation created a new way of engaging with the world, fostering habits of novelty-seeking and fragmented attention that are familiar today. The author draws parallels between 19th-century critics who worried about the newspaper's effect on the public mind and contemporary anxieties about digital media and AI. The piece reflects on whether today's technology represents the endgame of this long-developing battle for human focus.</p>
