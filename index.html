          <p>UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell confirmed a man-made famine in Gaza City, projecting its rapid spread and reporting approximately 18,000 child deaths, or 28 children daily, since October 7th. Russell criticized Israeli government claims of flawed UN data and urged international press access to verify the dire situation. She also highlighted the ineffectiveness of alternative aid distribution methods and emphasized the urgent need for humanitarian access to prevent further unnecessary child fatalities. The crisis is not due to natural disasters but an inability to deliver sufficient aid.</p>

          <p>Internal correspondence reveals that numerous Jesuit officials in the 1970s and 1980s were aware of a priest, Donald B. Dickerson, who sexually assaulted children, yet he was still ordained. Despite warnings and psychological reports, Dickerson continued to be assigned to institutions where further allegations arose, including a pending lawsuit alleging sexual assault at Loyola University New Orleans. The article highlights a systemic failure to contain a known predator, with one official, Thomas Stahel, expressing serious misgivings before Dickerson's ordination. This controversial history raises questions about the ongoing canonization cause for former Jesuit superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was aware of the case.</p>

After challenging first-round exits in previous years and missing a tournament due to injury, Raducanu's return to Flushing Meadows sees her close to the world's top 30.

          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are reportedly waiving defensive back Shilo Sanders following his ejection from Saturday night’s preseason game against the Buffalo Bills. Sanders was seen throwing a punch at Bills tight end Zach Davidson, an action Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles deemed "inexcusable." As the son of Deion Sanders, Shilo joined the team as an undrafted free agent and was competing for a roster spot.

          <p>England and Wales are set to introduce new sentencing rules that could bar convicted criminals from pubs and sports matches, alongside driving and travel bans. This legislation, expected next month, aims to broaden the scope of non-custodial punishments and ease prison overcrowding by restricting short sentences and introducing early release for well-behaved inmates. While some experts and hospitality figures express concerns about implementation and funding, the Ministry of Justice states the reforms are intended to deter crime and enhance public safety. The bill also includes plans for stricter probation conditions, such as geographical restrictions for serious offenders.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to overhaul its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels while awaiting decisions. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body with independent adjudicators to expedite the appeals process, which currently averages over a year with 51,000 pending cases. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue that reducing initial decision errors is key, as about half of appeals overturn original rulings.

The White House has been reportedly planning to send troops to Chicago, a Democratic stronghold, to address crime, homelessness, and immigration.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million for Monday's drawing, making it the 10th largest prize in the lottery's history, after no player matched all winning numbers on Saturday. The cash value for the upcoming drawing is estimated at $338.6 million. While the grand prize remains unclaimed, tickets in Maine, Massachusetts, and South Dakota won $1 million or $2 million by matching five white balls. This marks the 36th consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, fueling anticipation for the next round.</p>

          <p>Emine Erdogan, Turkey's First Lady, has appealed to US First Lady Melania Trump to extend her compassion, previously shown for Ukrainian children, to those in Gaza. In a letter, Erdogan urged Trump to write to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for measures to end the humanitarian crisis and protect Palestinian children. The appeal highlights the dire psychological state of children in Gaza, many of whom express a desire to die, and the significant number of child casualties reported by the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The White House has not yet responded to the appeal.</p>

          <p>A new online database from the Leopoldina Academy of Sciences and Max Planck Society details the profiles of 16,000 victims of Nazi forced medical research and human experiments. The atrocities, including testing pathogens and forced sterilizations on persecuted groups, had lasting impacts, with some data and specimens used in research and teaching for decades after 1945. Medical historian Dr. Herwig Czech notes the expertise gained from concentration camp experiments was even applied in aviation and NASA's space medicine. The database and a 2023 Lancet Commission report expose the widespread involvement of medical professionals and the need for continued critical examination of this dark chapter in medical history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that American universities face an existential crisis, not primarily financial, but a loss of their 'soul' due to a decline in academic freedom and public trust. The author contends that both left-wing 'cancel culture' and right-wing political interference have eroded the university's ability to foster open debate. The solution, the article proposes, lies in universities reclaiming academic freedom as their core value and adopting institutional neutrality, as outlined in the 1967 Kalven report. This means protecting all speech, even offensive views, and focusing solely on creating an environment where research and learning can flourish, rather than acting as political entities.</p>

Today, its Falcon 9 rockets and Dragon capsules are essential for ferrying astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.

          <p>Renewable energy executives are warning that President Donald Trump's policies against solar and wind projects could lead to a significant power crunch and increased electricity prices for consumers. Trump's administration has signaled it will block federal permits for such projects and implemented tariffs on metals, causing market instability and rising costs for developers. Companies like Engie North America are slashing U.S. investments due to this uncertainty. The industry fears these actions will hinder the grid's ability to meet surging demand, especially from AI data centers, potentially leading to brownouts and blackouts and impacting the nation's technological competitiveness.</p>

Nagovitsyna was last spotted alive by a surveillance drone on August 19 on a ridge near the summit of the notoriously difficult and cold 24,400-foot mountain.

          <p>Despite China's extensive trade relations with European nations, US allies are consistently resisting Beijing's charm offensive on trade, prioritizing foundational security and historical allegiance to Washington. This recalcitrance stems from centuries of shared identity, security integration, and cultural ties that bind these nations to the US strategic architecture. While economic pragmatism drives some engagement, allies instinctively safeguard intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments with the US. This dynamic highlights an unbridgeable gap between China's global ambitions and the geopolitical realities of its relationships with Western-aligned countries, where security concerns outweigh purely economic incentives.</p>

MPLX LP, a diversified midstream energy partnership, is favored for its growth and strong distribution yield of 7.5%, bolstered by a recent $2.38 billion acquisition. EOG Resources, an oil and gas exploration company, is also highlighted for its 3.4% dividend yield, strong balance sheet, and strategic acquisitions in the Utica shale. Finally, Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, is seen as a buy due to improving core business trends and resilience against tariff-led volatility, offering a 2.2% dividend yield.

The COLA, determined by third-quarter CPI-W changes, is now predicted by the Senior Citizens League to be 2.7%, up from an initial 2.1%. However, historical data shows that COLAs often lag the actual rate of inflation, leading to a consistent loss of purchasing power for retirees.
