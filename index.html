          <h2>Taiwanese Dollar Fluctuates Amid Speculation of U.S. Pressure and Central Bank Intervention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 07:40:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwanese dollar experienced a pullback after a historic surge, leading to speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the local currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar remains significantly up against the U.S. dollar for the year, driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt. The central bank's actions are under scrutiny, with some analysts suggesting that exchange rates may be part of U.S.-Taiwan trade conversations. The article notes that the central bank has been intervening to curb excessive inflows, but analysts are skeptical of any meaningful intervention so far.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports that U.S. imports and exports are facing significant disruptions reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic due to newly implemented trade tariffs. The agricultural sector is particularly hard-hit, with ports experiencing substantial declines in exports of key farm products like soybeans and corn. Small businesses are pausing orders due to increased costs, leading to a sharp drop in container volumes and potential 'lean' retail inventories in the coming months. A Hawaii-based freight liner operator, Matson, has already lowered its 2025 outlook, citing a 30% decline in container volume since the tariffs were implemented, and is actively working with Asia transshipment partners as its customers look at options to diversify and grow their manufacturing locations.</p>

          <p>DoorDash announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, alongside first-quarter revenue that fell short of expectations, causing shares to dip. The all-cash deal is expected to close in the second half of 2025 and aims to enhance DoorDash's ability to build world-class services that increase its potential to grow local commerce and support its financial goals. The company also reported total orders of 732 million for the quarter, an 18% increase year-over-year, though slightly below analyst expectations. DoorDash anticipates second-quarter adjusted EBITDA between $600 million and $650 million.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, asserts that President Trump will not silence him. Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained under a rarely used law citing "adverse foreign policy consequences" due to his leadership in protests against the Israel-Hamas war. He views his release as a "light of hope" for other detained student activists and criticizes the Trump administration's rationale as "laughable." Despite the ordeal, Mahdawi plans to continue protesting and advocating for justice and peace.</p>

Alongside it, Queen Camilla's portrait by Paul Benney was revealed, portraying her in a photorealistic style wearing her silk coronation dress.

          <p>Three years into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some antiwar parents and teachers are going to great lengths to shield children from state-mandated patriotic education classes. Some schools are creating fake schedules, while parents are opting for homeschooling or helping their children navigate the pervasive propaganda. The Kremlin's efforts to indoctrinate children have taken deep root in most schools, including weekly lessons involving the Russian flag and discussions on topics ranging from family values to Russia’s military glory. Despite the risks, many teachers are quietly resisting, with some schools using creative bookkeeping to avoid propaganda classes and focusing on custom-made history courses.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested over 200 suspected members of the Gulf Clan, a major drug cartel accused of murdering two dozen security force members in the past month. President Gustavo Petro has accused the group of systematically targeting security forces, prompting a response that included the deaths of 15 suspected drug traffickers in raids. The cartel reportedly paid its members between $2,300 and $3,500 for each dead police officer. The arrests come amid a surge in violence, and the government admits that Petro's strategy of pursuing "total peace" through dialogue with armed groups has not yet succeeded.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his mayoral bid, is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from the streets to address public safety concerns. The 36-page plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations, requiring screenings for mandatory outpatient treatment after hospital or jail discharge, and building more supportive housing units. Cuomo's ideas are similar to those proposed by Mayor Eric Adams, who has also struggled with public safety concerns. Cuomo's opponents argue that he deserves blame for making the mental health system worse by overseeing a reduction in psychiatric beds as governor.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% jump in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but warned that U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact earnings this year.

Ferrari cautioned that the introduction of U.S. tariffs on EU cars imported into the U.S. could negatively impact the firm's profitability this year. The president imposed a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. in early April. Ferrari said in late March that it would raise prices by 10% on certain models in response to the tariffs.</p>

Kamala Harris, the first Black woman ever to top a major-party ticket, was in the final weeks of her campaign for the White House.

          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor Tuesday, after he fell short of securing a majority in a shock first-round parliamentary vote. Merz needed at least 316 votes to become chancellor and only 310 members of parliament voted in his favor. Germany's Bundestag has a total of 630 members. The result marks an unanticipated setback for Merz who was widely expected to secure the necessary votes and be officially sworn in later in the day. Despite the setback, Merz is still expected to eventually be elected chancellor, economists and analysts said Tuesday.</p>

          <p>China is positioning itself as a more reliable development ally to Africa, particularly as a counter to what it calls American “bullying” under President Trump. Chinese diplomats are campaigning to rally opposition against U.S. trade policies, framing Trump’s tariffs as a threat to developing economies. Studies show that China is viewed more positively in Africa than in any other continent, and the tariff war is likely to strengthen ties between Africa and China. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has promised that China is "ready to share the opportunities of modernisation with African brothers and sisters”.</p>

They have requested information from the Justice Department regarding the criteria used to make the cuts and restore funding to some organizations. The impacted programs include initiatives supporting hate crime reduction, school shooting prevention, and assistance for human trafficking victims. A CBS News review found the impacted safety programs include a San Francisco-based organization that seeks to reduce hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a New York group that works to reduce school shootings, the "Emmett Till cold case investigations and prosecution program" in New Orleans, the "Matthew Shepard and James Byrd hate crimes training and technical assistance" initiative for crime reduction in Florida, a Michigan group that supports re-entry for young offenders and a Virginia group that helps human trafficking and sexual assault victims.</p>

The question is whether stripping her of her voting rights does more than simply strike at her right to free speech.

          <p>The US government is offering migrants who are in the country illegally a sum worth $1,000 (£751) and paid travel if they decide to leave the US. Those who signed up for the "self-deportation" financial incentive would not be prioritised for detention by immigration officials, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release.
