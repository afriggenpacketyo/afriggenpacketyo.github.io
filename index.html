          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has initiated legal action against Alina Habba, accusing her of malicious prosecution related to his arrest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

The lawsuit claims that Habba's actions were unwarranted and aimed at damaging his reputation. The case highlights the intersection of political activism and legal proceedings, raising questions about the motivations behind the prosecution and the potential for abuse of power. </p>

          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu next month, seeking to boost sales after a slow start to the year. The fast-food chain initially offered snack wraps nearly two decades ago but discontinued them in 2016 due to kitchen efficiency concerns. The return of the snack wrap on July 10 comes as McDonald's faces slowing sales, partly due to cautious consumer spending. This time, the snack wraps will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors, marking McDonald's broader push into the chicken market.</p>

The study found no significant difference in diarrhea symptoms between participants who took Pepto Bismol and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, its off-label use for prevention is now being questioned.

          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure air pollution levels and communicate associated health risks. It uses a color-coded system ranging from green (good) to maroon (hazardous) to indicate the severity of pollution. The AQI is calculated based on five major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. High AQI values indicate potential health impacts, ranging from headaches to severe cardiovascular issues, especially for sensitive groups like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.</p>

          <p>Six Nobel prize-winning economists have voiced strong opposition to President Trump's budget bill, citing concerns over proposed cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The economists argue that these cuts disproportionately harm low-income Americans while benefiting corporations through tax cuts. They estimate that the bill will significantly increase the national deficit without addressing key economic challenges. The economists urge the Senate to reject the bill and develop a new budget from scratch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Sei-Jah Rivera by a California Highway Patrol officer is under scrutiny due to the absence of body camera footage. Rivera was shot 12 times after a pursuit, with authorities claiming he brandished a gun. The CHP has been slow to adopt body cameras, with only a small percentage of officers equipped. The family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, citing inconsistencies in the officers' accounts and the lack of video evidence. The case highlights the importance of body cameras in providing transparency and accountability in law enforcement incidents.</p>

Experts suggest that while weather plays a role, other factors such as smuggling operations and the desire to reach the UK are more significant.</p>
