          <p>Two foreign nationals, Cui Guanghai of China and John Miller of the United Kingdom, have been charged by the U.S. Justice Department for their involvement in a scheme to smuggle U.S. military equipment, including missiles and cryptographic devices, into China. Prosecutors allege that Cui, acting on behalf of the Chinese government, and Miller coordinated with individuals, who were actually FBI agents, to export the equipment, discussing methods to conceal the devices to avoid detection. The duo also allegedly recruited people to surveil a U.S. citizen critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping and planned to destroy statues of Xi and his wife. The Justice Department is seeking their extradition from Serbia, where they were arrested, and if convicted, they face significant prison sentences. Optimism surrounding the situation is low considering the national security implications.</p>

Gomes, who entered the U.S. on a student visa that has since lapsed, is eligible for asylum, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf. ICE officials defended the arrest, stating that Gomes was in the country illegally and was driving his fatherâ€™s vehicle, while his father was the original target of the immigration investigation. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey expressed her disturbance and outrage, and a federal judge temporarily blocked Gomes's transfer out of the state. The community is rallying to support the teenager, who was not the intended target of the investigation, which indicates a lower sense of stability.</p>

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed President Donald Trump's reaction to Ukraine's drone operation on Russian military airfields, emphasizing the administration's desire for the war to end through negotiation. Leavitt stated that the war has been brutal and resulted in too many deaths, and that President Trump has communicated his stance to both leaders involved, both publicly and privately. When asked about Trump's reaction to the latest talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, Turkey, Leavitt sidestepped the question, deferring any response to the president himself.

          <p>Ukraine executed a complex drone attack, dubbed 'Spider Web,' targeting air bases deep within Russia, including those housing nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) smuggled drones into Russia inside wooden cabins on lorries, launching over 100 drones across multiple regions, causing damage to strategic missile-carrying bombers like the Tu-95. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the operation took over a year and a half to prepare and involved 117 drones, with one target located near an FSB office. The attack caused significant losses for Russia, with Ukraine claiming 41 bombers were hit and at least 13 destroyed, which creates a level of instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts looming, opening a $10,000 long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) in June could be a wise financial move. Rate cuts are anticipated later in the summer, which could reduce CD interest rates, so locking in current rates is advantageous. A long-term CD protects against market volatility with fixed interest rates, ensuring steady interest accumulation and predictable budgeting. Depending on the term and rate, savers can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest, making it a low-effort way to grow savings, which indicates an increase in stability.

          <p>The Republican tax cut package passed by the House is projected to increase the U.S. debt by trillions of dollars, raising concerns among economists and some Republican senators. The bill, which cuts taxes for households, largely benefiting the wealthy, and reduces spending for safety-net programs, could lead to higher interest rates for consumers and reduced demand for Treasury bonds. Economists warn that a higher debt burden would make consumer loans more expensive, and Moody's has already cut the U.S.' sovereign credit rating, signaling increased credit risk for investors.
