          <p>A shooting attack at a busy bus stop in northern Jerusalem resulted in the deaths of six people and left several others wounded. Israeli police reported that two Palestinian gunmen, who opened fire on civilians before boarding a bus, were neutralized by a security officer and a civilian at the scene. The incident is one of the deadliest since the start of the Gaza war, with Hamas praising the attack as a "natural response" to Israeli actions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed harsh measures, stating that Israel is in a "full-scale war against terror."</p>

The Great Run Company acknowledged the error with a "Wear sorry!" statement, reframing the mistake as a unique keepsake that makes the items part of the event's history.

          <p>At least 14 people were killed and dozens more were injured in Kathmandu after police opened fire on demonstrators protesting a government ban on most social media platforms. Tens of thousands of protesters, primarily from "Gen Z," had gathered to oppose the government's decision to block unregistered platforms like Facebook and X. Authorities stated that police were compelled to use force after the crowd breached a restricted area around the Parliament building. The ban is linked to a controversial bill that critics argue is a tool for censorship and suppressing dissent.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue massive refunds, potentially up to $1 trillion, if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. The administration has asked the high court for an expedited ruling to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of the tariffs illegal. While Bessent expressed confidence in a favorable outcome, officials are also preparing backup plans, such as using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to implement tariffs on national security grounds. The legal battle creates significant uncertainty for businesses and the U.S. Treasury. (not investment advice)</p>

Rodgers delivered a strong performance with 244 passing yards and four touchdown passes, marking his second consecutive game with that many scores. When asked about the significance of beating the Jets, whose head coach had previously doubted his fit with the team, Rodgers quipped, "I was happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A persistent shortage of affordable homes and high mortgage rates are forcing many U.S. home sellers to lower their asking prices and offer concessions. The power dynamic in the housing market is shifting, particularly in the South and West, where increased new construction has given buyers more options and leverage. While the national median home price has risen slightly, many metro areas are seeing declines as sellers struggle to attract buyers who are priced out of the market. This trend marks a significant change from the bidding wars of recent years, though overall home sales remain sluggish.</p>

          <p>New FDA guidelines restricting COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to those 65 and older or with underlying conditions are causing anxiety among many Americans as a new surge begins. The article highlights personal stories of individuals worried about protecting themselves and their vulnerable family members, such as an immunocompromised parent or a bride-to-be fearing illness on her wedding day. Many express concern that the new rules, part of the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, complicate access and will lead to a less vaccinated, and therefore less safe, public. The changes are seen by some as a dangerous shift in public health policy.</p>

          <p>The culture of the American South is increasingly permeating the national mainstream, influencing everything from college choices to music and business. Factors like the civil rights movement, the advent of air conditioning, and the interstate highway system initially made the region more accessible and economically viable for businesses seeking union-unfriendly environments. This has led to a population boom and a cultural shift, with Southern hip-hop and country music dominating charts and students flocking to Southern universities.

          <p>In Fall River, Massachusetts, a former manufacturing hub, businesses are feeling the negative effects of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, challenging the administration's promise of a manufacturing revival. Local companies, including a high-end bedding maker and a specialty gear producer, report that the tariffs have significantly raised the cost of imported materials, hurting profits and forcing cuts to investment and marketing. While some inquiries for U.S.-based production have increased, businesses are hesitant to expand due to hiring difficulties and doubts about sustained demand.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War, is a truthful reflection of its historical function and the administration's aggressive foreign policy. The author contends that the U.S. has consistently engaged in undeclared wars and military interventions even under the "defense" moniker. The article criticizes Trump's recent military actions in Syria, Somalia, Yemen, and Iran, suggesting the name change aligns with his administration's celebration of the nation as an unrestrained aggressor. This move is presented as part of a broader effort to project an image of strength and lethality.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing divergence in union membership across the United States, with states that protect collective bargaining rights seeing membership gains while "right-to-work" states experience declines. In 2024, pro-union states added nearly 10,000 members, whereas right-to-work states lost 200,000. The analysis highlights that workers in right-to-work states, which weaken unions by allowing employees to opt out of dues, earn about 7% less on average. The findings underscore how state-level policies are creating a fractured landscape for organized labor, despite high public approval for unions nationwide.</p>

          <p>A French former anesthetist, Frédéric Péchier, is on trial for allegedly poisoning 30 patients between 2008 and 2017, resulting in 12 deaths. Prosecutors argue that Péchier, 53, intentionally tampered with intravenous medicine bags to induce cardiac arrests in otherwise healthy patients, possibly as a way to seek revenge against colleagues. The investigation began in 2017 after a patient unexpectedly went into a coma and was found to have received a dose of potassium 100 times higher than expected. Péchier maintains his innocence, claiming there is no proof and that he is being framed.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence has generated concern about job displacement, a senior economist from the job site Indeed suggests its current impact on the broader labor market remains relatively small. The article argues that recent slowdowns in hiring are more attributable to general economic uncertainty under the Trump administration than to AI-driven layoffs, which have been largely confined to the tech sector. Instead of replacing workers, many employers are seeking to retrain staff and are showing increased demand for AI-related skills. Career experts advise workers to proactively learn how AI can be used as a tool in their respective fields.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the challenges facing the "Abundance" movement, a center-left agenda focused on progress in housing, energy, and infrastructure, as it tries to unify a deeply divided Democratic party. The author argues that the movement is doomed because it must court a far-left wing that is ideologically opposed to the hierarchical, power-driven methods required for large-scale building projects, exemplified by historical figures like Robert Moses and FDR. The article contends that the far-left's focus on performative democracy and social equality conflicts with the trade-offs necessary for material progress, making a genuine alliance for "abundance" impossible.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration deploys federal troops to combat crime in Washington, D.C., the nearby city of Baltimore is seeing historic lows in its murder rate through a different approach. Baltimore's strategy focuses on community-violence intervention and targeted enforcement against the small number of individuals responsible for most violent crime, rather than mass arrests. City leaders, including Mayor Brandon Scott, argue that Trump's methods are a return to failed zero-tolerance policies and have rejected the idea of federal troops. The article contrasts this with the administration's defunding of local programs aimed at rehabilitation, highlighting a deep divide on effective crime prevention.</p>

This rebranding project is seen as having sinister motives, promoting a vision of a whiter, more patriarchal America while challenging the multiracial coalition that elected his predecessor.

The vote was triggered by Bayrou's proposed €44 billion in public spending cuts, which are deeply unpopular with opposition parties on both the far-left and far-right. This crisis stems from the snap elections in 2024 that left President Emmanuel Macron without a stable majority, making it nearly impossible to pass legislation.

According to friends, Psillakis spotted the shark, urged others to group together and head to shore, but was fatally mauled in the process. Biologists determined that a white shark measuring up to 12 feet was likely responsible for the attack, which was the first fatal one in Sydney since 2022. In response, authorities have closed local beaches and deployed additional smart drumlines to monitor shark activity.</p>
