        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to require medical schools to include nutrition courses in their curriculum to remain eligible for federal funding. Kennedy expressed concern over the lack of nutrition education in medical schools, emphasizing the need for physicians to treat illnesses with food and preventative measures rather than relying solely on medication. While details of the plan are sparse, it has garnered support from nutrition experts who have long advocated for comprehensive nutrition education in medical training. Some medical schools claim they already offer sufficient nutrition education, but a 2015 study revealed that medical students receive an average of only 19 hours of required nutrition education during their four years of study. </p>

Thirty Ink is a house-of-brands conglomerate that includes Unanimous Media, Gentleman's Cut bourbon, and Underrated Golf and Basketball. A significant portion of the revenue is attributed to Curry's partnership with Under Armour, where he serves as president of Curry Brand. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization reached $144 million, due to low bottom-line operational costs.

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone attack on Russian military airfields highlighted the vulnerability of even advanced militaries to inexpensive, readily available drone technology. The attack, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, destroyed several strategic bombers and revealed how swarms of small drones can evade traditional ground defenses. This operation serves as a reminder that military bases and headquarters worldwide are at risk from similar asymmetric attacks. The innovative use of drones by Ukraine is likely to inspire other groups to adopt similar tactics against well-funded adversaries.</p>

          <p>Dr. Cate Shanahan identifies eight seed oils that she believes are harmful to health, including corn, canola, cottonseed, soy, sunflower, safflower, rice bran, and grape seed. She says these oils require high heat and pressure for extraction, leading to the presence of a neurotoxin called hexane. The oils contain polyunsaturated fatty acids that can degrade into toxins during heating, and the refining process removes essential nutrients. While some health agencies defend seed oils, Shanahan argues that they are commonly found in processed foods and restaurants, making them a significant source of unhealthy ingredients. </p>

          <p>Jack Grealish is anticipated to be excluded from Manchester City's squad for the FIFA Club World Cup. His future with the team is uncertain as the summer transfer window approaches, suggesting he may benefit from a move before the next season. Several European clubs are likely to express interest in Grealish, who might be drawn to a fresh start at a top club that can offer him consistent playing time. Grealish is reportedly keeping an open mind about his future, as the Club World Cup is scheduled to run from June 14 to July 13 in the United States.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Virginia unearthed the remains of four Confederate soldiers while excavating the grounds of a building that stored gunpowder during the American Revolution. The team is now trying to identify the soldiers, a rare endeavor that will include searching for living descendants and requesting DNA swabs. The museum has recovered enough genetic material from the men's teeth for possible matches. The archaeologists have narrowed the possible identities to four men who served in regiments from Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina and Virginia.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 5-Year Rule for Annuities</h2>

          <p>The 5-year rule is an IRS regulation that affects how non-spouse beneficiaries must take distributions from an inherited annuity when the original contract owner dies. It essentially requires that the entire value of the annuity be distributed, either all at once or in multiple withdrawals, within five years of the original owner's death. This rule generally applies to non-qualified annuities, which are funded with after-tax dollars, and only comes into play when the beneficiary is not a spouse. It is important for beneficiaries to understand the tax implications, as withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. (not investment advice)</p>
