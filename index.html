          <p>Nvidia and AMD have reached an unusual agreement with the Trump administration, consenting to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China. In return, the companies will receive export licenses for their H20 and MI308 chips, securing access to the lucrative Chinese market. While investors view the deal as a net positive, analysts describe it as a transactional "pay-to-play" tactic that sets a strange precedent for U.S. trade policy. The arrangement underscores the strategic importance of semiconductors in the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared a public safety emergency in Washington D.C., placing the city's police department under federal control and deploying National Guard troops. Citing concerns over crime and homelessness, the administration has appointed new leadership to oversee the force, aiming to clear encampments and increase law enforcement presence. This move has been met with contention, as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and city crime statistics indicate that overall crime has actually decreased. The administration states the effort is a "whole of government approach" to improve public safety in the capital.</p>

          <p>Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to fundamentally alter e-commerce by integrating direct checkout functionalities, allowing users to purchase items without leaving the chat interface. This shift could streamline the buying process, but it also poses a significant challenge to established online marketplaces like Amazon and payment processors such as PayPal by potentially controlling the initial product discovery phase. Experts believe the new battleground for online retail will be for user attention in the "pre-sale" phase, where AI assistants guide consumer choices. This evolution is seen as a seismic shift in the internet's economic model.</p>

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict Erin could strengthen into the season's first hurricane by the end of the week as it approaches the Caribbean. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its development aligns with predictions for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a direct warning to President Trump, stating he will lead an effort to redraw California's congressional maps if Republican-led states like Texas proceed with their own redistricting plans. In a letter, Newsom accused the GOP of attempting to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" and destabilize democracy through gerrymandering. He stated that California could neutralize any gains Republicans hope to make, but would stand down if other states halt their efforts. This move escalates the partisan battle over congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>

          <p>Ford has announced a $2 billion investment in its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant as part of a new strategy to develop more affordable electric vehicles. The "Universal EV Program" will begin with a midsize electric pickup truck slated for a 2027 launch, with a target starting price of $30,000. CEO Jim Farley described the initiative as a "radical approach" to compete with global EV manufacturers, particularly from China. The investment will secure thousands of jobs and includes plans to assemble new LFP batteries in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials from the case of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Judge Paul Engelmayer ruled that releasing the documents would not provide any meaningful new information, stating they are redundant of trial evidence and contain no "untapped mine lode" of undisclosed facts. The judge suggested the government's motion might be a "diversion" aimed at creating the illusion of transparency rather than providing it. This decision keeps the typically secret grand jury proceedings in the high-profile case confidential.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its iconic dial-up internet service at the end of September, marking the end of an era for the technology that introduced millions to the online world. The characteristic sound of a modem connecting was the soundtrack for early internet exploration in the 1990s, when AOL peaked with over 23 million subscribers. While only a small fraction of U.S. households still use the service, its discontinuation formally retires a piece of technological history. The move reflects the complete shift to modern broadband connectivity.</p>

          <p>Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stated that individuals who commit rape "probably" forfeit their right to be recognized by their chosen gender. In an interview, she reflected on the controversy surrounding transgender offender Isla Bryson, who was initially placed in a women's prison, admitting the debate lost "all sense of rationality" and that she was partly responsible. Sturgeon, who previously refused to call Bryson a man, now described the convicted rapist as a "biological male." Her comments mark a significant shift in her position on the contentious issue of gender recognition for violent criminals.</p>

          <p>The federal program that compensates private attorneys appointed to represent defendants who cannot afford one is facing a severe funding crisis, having run out of money in early July. This shortfall means thousands of lawyers and their support staff across the country are not being paid for constitutionally mandated work, threatening the viability of the public defense system. The crisis stems from a congressional funding gap and a hiring freeze in federal defenders' offices, raising concerns about attorney shortages and potential violations of defendants' rights to a speedy trial. Lawmakers must appropriate an estimated $116 million to cover the gap.</p>

To succeed in a male-dominated world, she adopted the name "Steve."

The company now expects a significantly wider operating loss compared to the previous year. Siebel, who is currently searching for a successor, expressed confidence that the company is now positioned to accelerate. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests that HYSAs are preferable for those who need liquidity and access to an emergency fund, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who want to lock in a guaranteed higher interest rate for a set term, especially if they anticipate market rates will fall. For some, a combination of both products may offer an ideal balance of returns and accessibility. (not investment advice)</p>

The missile, which debuted in 2019, has seldom been seen publicly, and this new video provides a clearer view of the advanced weapon system. The footage depicts a rocket force brigade conducting a communications and launch exercise under simulated enemy jamming conditions.

          <p>A new study in the journal JAMA reveals that medication abortions have significantly driven up the total number of abortions in the U.S. since the repeal of Roe v. Wade. One provider, Aid Access, shipped nearly 120,000 abortion pill packs between 2023 and 2024, with the majority going to residents in states with abortion bans. The research found that provision rates were higher in poorer counties and those farther from physical clinics. This highlights the critical role of telehealth and "shield laws" in maintaining abortion access, even as legal challenges to these methods mount.</p>

While the government is proposing changes like compulsory eye tests for older drivers, it has no plans to limit the number of peer-age passengers new drivers can carry, citing concerns of unfair discrimination. Road safety charities and the AA argue such measures are crucial, as government data shows young drivers are disproportionately involved in fatal collisions, especially when carrying passengers their own age.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's performance in the Community Shield revealed a team with a rejuvenated attack but significant defensive frailties, according to this analysis. New signings Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz showed encouraging signs, with both contributing to goals and demonstrating creative energy. However, the team's shift to a new 4-2-3-1 formation left them looking defensively open, a problem seen throughout their pre-season. The absence of key midfielders exacerbated issues, with the back line often looking unsettled and vulnerable to simple through-balls, suggesting a period of adjustment will be needed.</p>
