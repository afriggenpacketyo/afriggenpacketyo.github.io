          <p>Dozens of Texas Democratic lawmakers have ended their walkout and returned to Austin, where they were met with a new rule requiring them to have police escorts to prevent another protest. The walkout was initiated to block a Republican-led effort, prompted by President Trump, to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP. In response to the Texas plan, California Democrats are now advancing their own redistricting proposal to counteract the potential Republican gains, escalating a partisan fight over control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>While the United States is experiencing significant collapses in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has reached a record high of 15 million colonies. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences attribute this divergence to different management practices. The U.S. model often involves large-scale, clustered operations with minimal intervention, whereas Chinese practices are different, leading to a thriving population that solidifies the country's position as the world's top producer of apiary goods.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's military operations in Gaza is rooted in structural racism. The author argues there is a stark double standard when comparing the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its paralysis over the Palestinian crisis. The piece suggests this disparity reveals a lingering colonial mindset that dehumanizes Palestinians and undermines the EU's credibility as a defender of international law and human rights.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Nicole Collier of Fort Worth is remaining inside the Texas Capitol after refusing to sign a document that would place her under a mandatory Department of Public Safety escort. This measure was imposed on Democratic lawmakers who returned after a walkout designed to block a Republican redistricting plan. Collier stated she would not "sign away my dignity" or allow Republicans to control her movements, framing her protest as a challenge to both the surveillance tactics and the discriminatory maps.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC's DJ Wingfield and UCLA's Kaedin Robinson, effectively preventing them from playing this season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing its "Five-Year Rule" violated antitrust laws by limiting their ability to earn NIL compensation. However, the judge ruled that the policy was a "true eligibility rule" and not commercial in nature, thus not subject to antitrust scrutiny, dealing a significant blow to both players and their respective teams.</p>

          <p>According to a report from S&P, Chinese exports to developing nations in the Global South have doubled since 2015, with growth accelerating significantly after the U.S.-China trade war began. These exports now total around $1.6 trillion, substantially more than China's combined exports to the United States and western Europe. Analysts suggest this trend reflects a strategic pivot by Chinese companies to mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs and could lead to a new global commercial order centered on South-South trade.</p>

          <p>India, the second-largest supplier of sailors worldwide, paradoxically leads the world in the number of seafarers abandoned on vessels by shipowners. This occurs when owners sever ties, failing to provide pay, provisions, or repatriation for the crew. The problem is largely attributed to the practice of registering ships under "flags of convenience" in countries with weak regulations, which obscures ownership and allows unscrupulous operators to evade responsibility, leaving crews like one stranded in Ukrainian waters in dire situations.</p>

          <p>Aligning with China's national strategy, several coastal provinces are rolling out ambitious plans to develop their marine economies. Regions like Fujian are focusing on fostering growth in emerging areas such as digitalized maritime governance, offshore energy production like wind and solar, and tourism. These initiatives are part of China's broader 2035 vision, which aims to leverage the country's extensive coastline to create new, sustainable sources of economic activity and technological advancement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department over a new rule that ties federal grants for crime victims to immigration enforcement cooperation. The lawsuit argues that it is illegal to force state and local programs, such as crisis centers and domestic abuse hotlines, to cooperate with federal immigration agents to receive critical funding. The states claim this politicizes essential services and is part of the administration's broader crackdown on "sanctuary" jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The official opening of Camp East Montana, a new migrant detention facility at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates. The center, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 people, has drawn criticism over concerns about due process, access to legal counsel for detainees, and the significant financial cost. While the administration defends the facility as essential to its mass deportation mandate, critics like Rep. Veronica Escobar argue the funds could be better used for community services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could serve as a catalyst for a significant geographic realignment. This change could potentially dissolve the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences, similar to the NBA. Manfred argued such a move would reduce player travel, create more compelling regional rivalries, and improve television time slots for West Coast games, with Nashville and Salt Lake City being potential expansion locations.</p>

          <p>An international research team is studying long tubes of mud extracted from the Antarctic seabed to reveal centuries of climate and ecological history. By analyzing the distinct layers of sediment, which act like a historical record, scientists can learn about past marine life and measure the impact of human activities like industrial whaling. This data, including environmental DNA from whales, will help researchers better understand the Southern Ocean's role in the global carbon cycle and its connection to climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new court filing reveals that body camera footage from the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka appears to show a federal agent stating the order came directly from the top of the Justice Department. The agent was reportedly heard on the phone and then announced to others, "We are arresting the mayor right now, per the deputy attorney general of the United States." This evidence suggests high-level political involvement in the arrest, which occurred during an attempted oversight visit at an immigration detention center.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved 5km in one piece to a new location. The entire city is being gradually relocated because of ground subsidence caused by more than a century of iron ore mining directly beneath it. The delicate and complex operation to transport the 672-tonne structure on giant rolling platforms represents a major symbolic milestone in the massive, multi-year project to move the Arctic city to safer ground.</p>
