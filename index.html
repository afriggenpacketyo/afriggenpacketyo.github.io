          <p>A 17-year-old has been arrested and charged with attempted murder following a shooting in New York's Times Square. The incident, which stemmed from a fight inside a restaurant, left three people injured, including a 19-year-old who was the intended target and two innocent bystanders. Police responded quickly after hearing gunshots and apprehended the suspect after a short pursuit a block away. A firearm was recovered from the scene, and the three victims were hospitalized in stable condition.</p>

McEntire, who was married to Blackstock's father for 26 years, had often stated she considered him and his siblings to be her own children, not stepchildren. She maintained this familial connection even after her divorce and also publicly supported both Blackstock and his ex-wife, Kelly Clarkson, during their separation.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a sharp slowdown. A combination of factors, including post-pandemic inflation, changing consumer habits among younger generations, and retaliatory tariffs from global trade disputes, has led to declining sales. This economic pressure has resulted in bankruptcies for smaller distilleries and production cuts from major brands. Analysts warn that an oversupply from previous boom years could lead to further consolidation and financial hardship within the iconic American industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by initiating a review of its federally funded research and threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents. In a letter, the Commerce Department accused Harvard of breaching contractual requirements and began a "march-in" process that could allow the government to take ownership of patents. This action follows previous moves to freeze federal funding over the university's handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests, which the administration deemed antisemitic. Critics suggest these actions are a pretext to assert federal control over academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The rapidly growing market for "functional beverages," which promise benefits like calm and relaxation, is facing scrutiny over its health claims. An investigation found that while many consumers enjoy these drinks as alternatives to alcohol, nutritionists are skeptical, noting the low dosage of active ingredients like Lion's Mane is unlikely to have a significant physiological effect. A psychologist suggests the perceived calming effect may be more related to the ritual of taking a moment for oneself. The article highlights a recent advertising ban against one major brand for making unsubstantiated medical claims.</p>

While the energy company has installed infrastructure to connect the village, the final step of wiring individual homes remains the government's responsibility and has been delayed.

          <p>Arizona Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego addressed a supportive crowd at a town hall in Iowa, sharply criticizing the Republican-backed tax bill signed by President Trump. Gallego called the legislation a "clarifying moment" for Democrats, arguing it will make America "poorer and sicker" and galvanizes his party's identity as fighters for the middle class. The event is part of a broader Democratic strategy to go on the offensive against the bill ahead of the midterm elections. Gallego's appearance in a competitive Iowa district also serves to raise his own national profile.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals as soon as they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences would be removed from the UK and barred from re-entry, with their home countries deciding if they serve any prison time. The government argues this would save taxpayers money and protect the public. Critics have questioned whether other countries will agree to accept the deported individuals under these terms.</p>

          <p>According to a board-certified neurologist, pomegranates are a highly recommended fruit for supporting healthy brain aging in people over 50. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Some studies suggest these nutrients may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be an alternative, but advises consulting a doctor before regular consumption.</p>

The IRS declined to release the identified taxpayer information, citing privacy rights, shortly before Long was dismissed.
