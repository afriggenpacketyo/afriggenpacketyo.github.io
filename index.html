        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's unexpected announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury Department officials off guard, despite months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government for relief. The announcement lacked specifics, causing confusion within the Treasury as officials scrambled to understand the scope and pace of the rollback. The Syrian government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has argued that sanctions hinder their ability to pay salaries, rebuild cities, and restore the health-care system. While some incremental lifting of sanctions was under consideration prior to the announcement, the sudden reversal took many by surprise, but a spokesperson said the Treasury Department is working to execute the President's vision.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that Arizona Democrats, particularly Governor Katie Hobbs, are facing significant challenges as they head into the 2026 elections. Hobbs is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic governors seeking re-election, and the state party is currently embroiled in internal conflicts. With a Republican-leaning electorate and formidable GOP primary contenders like Andy Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, Hobbs must consolidate support and address criticisms regarding her low-profile approach. The article also notes that Hobbs has faced frustrations from both the left and right, making her re-election bid an uphill battle.</p>

          <p>A new round of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas has commenced in Doha, mediated by Qatari and US officials, following a major Israeli offensive in Gaza. The offensive, dubbed "Operation Gideon's Chariots," has resulted in at least 300 Palestinian deaths since Thursday. Discussions are reportedly centered on the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a period of calm, but both sides have previously faced obstacles in reaching an agreement. The intensified military action has drawn condemnation from the UN and some European leaders, who warn of a worsening humanitarian crisis and potential ethnic cleansing.</p>

This strategic move aims to bolster the UAE's influence over global supply chains and diversify its economy away from fossil fuels.

          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) released a report revealing that combat sport clubs are being used to recruit members for the white nationalist group Patriot Front. These Active Clubs, smaller networks of white supremacist groups, use mixed martial arts training to bond members over white nationalist ideologies. The SPLC report's author, Jeff Tischauser, said this serves as a way to hide some of the Patriot Front's movements. The groups maintain a strong online presence to radicalize young men, and the new recruitment method has coincided with Patriot Front's faltering brand after years of controversies and lawsuits.</p>
