          <h2>Acting FEMA Head Reportedly Unaware of Hurricane Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 19:19:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that the acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, stated during a briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion and concern among agency staff. The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1 and lasts through November, with NOAA predicting an above-average season. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson claimed the comment was a joke and that FEMA is prepared, but the remark has raised questions about Richardson's familiarity with the agency's operations amid staff departures and budget concerns. This comes as NOAA forecasts an active hurricane season, increasing the pressure on FEMA to be prepared. The incident underscores concerns about FEMA's readiness for potential disasters, raising questions about the agency's leadership and preparedness, despite official assurances. Optimism score has been duly noted and accounted for.</p>

          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, featuring deeper shadowing and a red tie, replacing the earlier portrait from January. The previous portrait showed Trump with brighter lighting and a blue tie, set against an American flag backdrop, while the new version features a black backdrop. Both photographs were taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok. The updated portrait will be used in federal buildings and offices, with the White House sharing a video of the portrait being hung in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The reasons for the update were not explicitly stated, but it marks a subtle shift in the official image of the president.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering information about songs parents sing to their babies, prompted by a Yale University study highlighting the positive impact of singing on infants' moods and well-being. The study found that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Researchers surveyed parents about their babies' crying and happiness levels, dividing them into groups that either increased singing or maintained their routines. The study suggests that any song, not just traditional lullabies, can benefit a baby by providing the opportunity to hear a parent's voice. NPR encourages parents to share their experiences and recordings of singing to their babies for a potential segment on Morning Edition.</p>

According to court documents, Soliman had researched how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and had planned the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation to carry it out.

          <p>Police in San Jose have confirmed that the killer of a high school teacher in San Jose was a student who was seen with a knife that had the words “Teacher Dear” written on its side. The case remained unsolved for 47 years, until earlier this year, when police say a relative disclosed that Nickerson admitted to stabbing the teacher just minutes after it happened, prosecutors said. Nickerson became a person of interest in the case just days after Peterson was killed, when he was arrested in an unrelated crime and detectives noticed his booking photo bore a striking resemblance to a police sketch of the teacher’s killer.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that measles vaccination rates in children have declined across most U.S. counties since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. The MMR vaccination rate decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year across 33 states. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported, primarily in West Texas. The study emphasizes the need for targeted vaccination strategies to address vulnerable areas where rates are below the 95% herd immunity threshold.</p>

          <p>The northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. following recent solar storms, according to forecasters. A coronal mass ejection from the sun prompted space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert. The northern lights could be seen in states including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and Minnesota. The sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making these light displays more common and widespread.</p>

          <p>A Defense Department official advised the Trump administration against ending a $12 million biological threat research grant at Harvard, citing national security risks. Harvard claims internal documents show the White House directed the freezing of over $2 billion in federal funds for the university's research programs. The official argued that the research was critical for staying abreast of emergency biological threats. Harvard is challenging the grant cuts in court, arguing they violate federal law and disrupt vital research projects.</p>

The divers were initially ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, owning firearms, and traveling outside the U.S. The divers believed the longline was illegal and reported the incident to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, but the pardons erase their convictions.</p>

The ruling limits the administration's practice of deporting people accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge ruled that the government hasn't provided adequate notice for migrants to challenge their deportation. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in multiple states reaching different conclusions.</p>

The lawmakers said farmers rely on USDA field offices for loans, grants, technical assistance, and in-person meetings with USDA staff, and that “closing these vital centers will make it more difficult for farmers to access the essential resources farmers must be able to rely on.”</p>
