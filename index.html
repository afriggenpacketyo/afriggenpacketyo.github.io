          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in at least 622 deaths and over 1,300 injuries, according to Taliban government officials. The shallow quake, centered near Jalalabad, destroyed numerous villages in Kunar and Nangahar provinces, prompting immediate rescue operations. Medical teams from the capital and UN agencies are providing emergency assistance, with footage showing desperate efforts to find survivors amidst the rubble. This event marks one of Afghanistan's deadliest natural disasters in recent memory, highlighting the region's vulnerability to seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk surged after new trial data indicated its weight management drug, Wegovy (semaglutide), significantly outperforms rivals like Eli Lilly's tirzepatide in reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by up to 57%. This positive outcome comes as the company navigates an increasingly competitive weight loss market, despite Denmark recently halving its economic growth forecast partly due to Novo's declining U.S. market share. The findings reinforce Wegovy's position as a leading treatment for both weight management and cardiovascular health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's acquisition of elite strikers Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak signals a significant tactical shift under manager Arne Slot. This article explores five potential formations, including a squeezed 4-2-3-1 and a more fragile 4-4-2, to integrate both players alongside existing stars. The analysis suggests that while some configurations might be risky, the club's busy schedule means a "best XI" concept is outdated, with Ekitike likely to be a versatile cover option. The manager's challenge lies in balancing offensive power with midfield stability for the upcoming season.</p>

The cloud division saw accelerated revenue growth, becoming a key focus for investors seeking monetization of artificial intelligence, similar to Microsoft or Google. Alibaba's core e-commerce business also showed signs of revival, with new "instant commerce" features offering one-hour deliveries in China. These developments have boosted investor confidence despite earlier missed analyst expectations for overall revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced new measures to tighten rules for asylum seekers bringing family members to the UK, including tougher English language standards and financial requirements. These reforms aim to overhaul a "broken" asylum system and reduce reliance on hotels for migrants, following a significant increase in small boat crossings. The government also plans to introduce a fast-track appeals process and begin deportations to France under a new returns deal. Opposition parties criticized the changes as insufficient, calling the government "in complete denial" about the border situation.</p>

          <p>England has launched the final phase of its largest-ever childcare expansion, providing 30 hours of government-funded care for children aged nine months to four years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it a "landmark moment," but parents face long waiting lists due to nursery staff shortages and regional availability issues. Providers note that funding rates often fall short of costs, leading to additional charges for families and potential inequalities. While aiming to boost the economy and children's development, the scheme faces significant implementation challenges.</p>

          <p>ScotRail has permanently abolished peak rail fares, eliminating higher prices for weekday rush hour travel and offering significant savings for passengers, such as a nearly 50% reduction on Edinburgh to Glasgow tickets.

While an earlier pilot scheme saw limited success in boosting passenger numbers, the Scottish government, championing the policy, hopes this permanent change will make public transport more affordable and accessible.

Sources close to the Queen indicate she did not publicize this experience previously to avoid overshadowing the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, whom she now champions through her charity work.

The finding suggests that the city of Aral possesses natural conditions suitable for cultivating such organisms.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that a sustainable peace in Ukraine requires addressing the "root causes" of the crisis, specifically NATO's eastward enlargement. Speaking at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Putin reiterated his long-held view that the West provoked the conflict by attempting to draw Ukraine into NATO. He also claimed that "understandings" reached with U.S. President Donald Trump at a recent Alaska summit could pave the way for peace, an assertion he plans to discuss further with other leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD fell nearly 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle maker reported a 30% slump in second-quarter net profit, despite a 14% rise in revenue driven by overseas sales. The significant profit drop is attributed to an aggressive price war within China's highly competitive EV industry, which has seen retail car prices fall by about 19% over two years. BYD acknowledged the "adverse periodic impact" of increased price competition and excessive marketing. Chinese authorities have warned against such price cuts, as automakers like BYD increasingly expand into global markets to counter domestic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's RatingDog manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose to 50.5 in August, indicating the fastest expansion in five months and beating estimates. This growth was primarily fueled by a recovery in new export orders, suggesting external demand resilience despite tariffs. However, the article notes that gains in overall output and new orders were muted, reflecting little improvement in domestic demand. Employment in the manufacturing sector remained bleak, reducing jobs for a fifth consecutive month. The durability of this upturn depends on sustained exports and a pickup in domestic demand.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, citing concerns they would face abuse and persecution. The emergency injunction followed reports of children being prepared for flights back to Guatemala. While the administration claimed these were family reunifications, advocacy groups disputed this. The 14-day ruling prevents officials from sending any unaccompanied children at risk of deportation, sparking criticism from White House immigration advisor Stephen Miller. This highlights ongoing legal battles over the administration's immigration policies.</p>

Prescott indicated that negotiations between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had become personal, making a resolution necessary to avoid further "headache and distraction" for the team. The Packers secured Parsons with a record-setting four-year, $188 million deal for a non-quarterback, giving up two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return.

          <p>U.S. tariffs have negatively impacted factory activity across Asia, with manufacturing sectors in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all shrinking in August. This trend underscores the challenges Asian economies face in maintaining profits as exports weaken. However, China's RatingDog manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose to 50.5, indicating growth and bucking the regional trend, primarily due to resilient external demand. Analysts warn that the hit from U.S. tariffs will likely intensify, particularly for countries reliant on U.S.-bound shipments, emphasizing the fragile economic recovery and the need for policy support in the region.
