          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in Missoula, Montana, remains unsolved six years after she was last seen leaving a bar with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance. Security footage captured Charlo and DeFrance together the night she vanished, and DeFrance's changing accounts have raised suspicions, though he has never been named a suspect. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone in an area where DeFrance was living hours after she was last seen, and he later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho. Despite extensive searches and the dedication of Detective Guy Baker, Charlo's family continues to seek answers and bring her home for proper closure.</p>

NASA's Artemis program and a joint China-Russia project are planning to establish permanent lunar bases for scientific research and as a stepping stone for future Mars missions. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, titanium, rare earth elements, and water ice, could be used for self-sufficiency and even rocket propellant production. These lunar missions aim to advance scientific knowledge, develop technologies for long-term space travel, and potentially establish a hub for further exploration.</p>

He acknowledged the constant speculation surrounding his name whenever the Tottenham position becomes available but affirmed his focus on his present responsibilities with the national team.

Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and an overreach, emphasizing that local law enforcement was sufficient and that the federal government was sowing chaos.

          <p>Italy is holding a national referendum on reducing the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move that has polarized the country. Supporters argue it would align Italy with other European nations and integrate long-term foreign residents who contribute to the economy. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and urging Italians to abstain from voting. The outcome of the referendum could affect up to 1.4 million people, potentially granting them full rights and recognition as Italian citizens.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer’s government plans to modernize and potentially expand Britain’s nuclear arsenal, a move that undermines international non-proliferation efforts and fuels a global arms race. This decision contradicts the spirit of the non-proliferation treaty and sends a cynical signal to other nations. The author argues that retaining nuclear weapons at increased levels does not make Britain safer and diverts resources from essential services. The article urges public education about the dangers of weapons proliferation, advocating for gradual disarmament as the only way to escape the nightmare of nuclear warfare.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized a rare mineral, tellurium, primarily produced in China, to develop an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and granted them the ability to see infrared light. This breakthrough offers significant potential for treating human blindness, according to the scientists involved. The study detailed how nanowire implants made from tellurium were used in a biocompatible device that restored vision in blind mice and a monkey, while also enabling them to perceive "invisible" light. Tellurium's photoelectric properties allow it to convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina.</p>

The findings come as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system.
