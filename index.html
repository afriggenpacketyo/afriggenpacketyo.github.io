          <p>In his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on his time on the bench, where he was often the deciding vote on landmark cases concerning issues like abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Speaking with "CBS Sunday Morning," Kennedy expresses concern that the current Supreme Court has become "a little bit too personal and confrontational." He argues that a broader decline in civility and ethics in public discourse is now putting American democracy itself in danger.</p>

          <p>As "The Simpsons" begins its 37th season, creator Matt Groening discusses the animated sitcom's enduring appeal and its uncanny ability to seemingly predict future events. In an interview for "CBS Sunday Morning," Groening reflects on the show's evolution from a one-off episode in 1987 to America's longest-running sitcom. He also shares insights into how his own family, who inspired the characters' names, reacted to their cartoon counterparts and why the show's humor continues to resonate across generations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents are increasingly operating in major cities far from the border, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan. Human rights advocates and legal experts express concern that these agents, trained for border interdiction, are ill-suited for urban civil immigration enforcement and may be employing overly aggressive tactics. The agency's authority extends 100 miles from any international boundary, covering most major cities, but their recent deployments into these areas mark a significant shift from their traditional roles.</p>

          <p>A recent Harvard Business Review study found over 40% of U.S. employees receive AI-generated content, dubbed "workslop," that appears useful but lacks real substance, ultimately harming productivity. While AI technology receives criticism, this article argues that the responsibility lies with employers who fail to properly implement it. The author contends that without proper training, clear policies, and a strategic plan for using AI as a tool, businesses are setting themselves and their employees up for failure, making them the true producers of the subpar output.</p>

          <p>Director Kathryn Bigelow's latest thriller, "A House of Dynamite," depicts the harrowing 19 minutes the U.S. president has to respond to an inbound nuclear missile. The film, praised for its authenticity by military consultants like retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler, aims to highlight the immense pressure and lack of preparedness for such a catastrophic event. Screenwriter Noah Oppenheim and Bigelow hope the movie reminds audiences that the nuclear era is not over, prompting a conversation about how to dismantle these global threats without causing further destruction.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's national security adviser, had no role in the substance or evidence related to the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The charges were dropped last month after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the government failed to provide necessary evidence defining China as a national security threat during the period of the alleged offenses. The Conservative opposition has suggested Powell was behind the decision and has called for him to resign.</p>

          <p>In a stunning and emotional final, Monaco's Valentin Vacherot, ranked 204th in the world, defeated his cousin Arthur Rinderknech to win the Shanghai Masters.

          <p>An advice columnist tackles the question of whether it's acceptable to engage with the Harry Potter universe despite author J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views. The writer argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that many beloved works have problematic creators. Instead of simply "offsetting" purchases with donations, the columnist suggests a more transformative approach: engaging with the content critically and in community, discussing its flaws and positive messages to generate social good, much like how religious communities have long interrogated their own canonical texts.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has stated that the precedent set in 2011, when the SNP's majority win at Holyrood led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his party secures a majority in the next election. The SNP conference backed this strategy, which aims to make the next election a de-facto poll on independence. However, the UK Labour government, which would need to approve a new vote, has reiterated its opposition, with Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander dismissing the plan as a distraction from the SNP's domestic record.</p>

A key issue was reportedly Gerrard's reluctance to work under the club's new sporting director structure, a significant change from his previous tenure when he had more direct control over operations.</p>
