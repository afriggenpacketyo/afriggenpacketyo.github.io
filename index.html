          <p>Following Nico Iamaleava's controversial transfer from Tennessee to UCLA amid NIL negotiation disputes, Joey Aguilar, who had recently joined UCLA, is now transferring to Tennessee. Iamaleava's move was spurred by a reported rift with Tennessee over NIL deals, with claims that he sought a $4 million deal. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, brings a strong track record of 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns from Appalachian State. This quarterback shuffle highlights the growing influence of NIL deals in college football and the potential for player movement based on financial incentives.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging its attempts to exert control over academic decision-making. The lawsuit aims to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in federal funding after Harvard refused to comply with demands, including appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard President Alan Garber argues that the government should not dictate what universities teach or who they admit. The Trump administration's actions follow months of campus activism related to the war in Gaza, which the administration has characterized as anti-American and antisemitic, accusations refuted by Garber.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed adding 227 positions to the Fire Department, including firefighters and EMTs, in response to the destructive Palisades wildfire. This proposal comes amidst budget constraints in other city agencies, highlighting the priority placed on bolstering fire response capabilities. The move follows criticism that budget cuts hampered the department's ability to combat the wildfire, which destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and resulted in 12 deaths. The proposed budget also includes initiatives to address fires related to homelessness and improve equipment maintenance.</p>

          <p>An experiment to grow food in space has launched, aiming to develop lab-grown food for astronauts. The European Space Agency (ESA) is funding research to explore reducing the cost of feeding astronauts, which can reach Â£20,000 per day. The project involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and processing them into food. This initiative is a first step towards a pilot food production plant on the International Space Station, potentially leading to 3D-printed steaks in space, according to researchers at Imperial College, London.</p>

          <p>US trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a year-long trade case. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This action follows accusations from American manufacturers, including Hanwha Qcells and First Solar Inc, that Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Southeast Asia are flooding the market with unfairly cheap goods. Dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while countervailing duties range from 14.64% to 3,403.96%.</p>

Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.</p>
