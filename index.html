          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests following ICE operations, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory. Mr. Trump invoked Title 10 authority, ordering 2,000 troops to the city, leading to clashes between protesters and authorities, with multiple arrests and reports of injuries. Newsom stated that California Highway Patrol units were being deployed to maintain order, accusing the federal government of escalating tensions. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said city officials are working with law enforcement to find a resolution, as the deployment raises questions about federal overreach and the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help address declining birth rates in China and other countries. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce, prompting authorities to explore innovative policies to encourage higher birth rates. The study also highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women.</p>
