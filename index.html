          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has imposed sanctions on four judges from the International Criminal Court (ICC). These sanctions are in response to the ICC's investigations into U.S. military personnel and the issuance of arrest warrants against top Israeli officials. The U.S. government views the ICC's actions as illegitimate and an infringement upon the sovereignty and national security of both the United States and its ally, Israel. The sanctions reflect the ongoing tension between the U.S. and the ICC regarding the court's jurisdiction over U.S. citizens and actions. </p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz visited Washington, D.C., hoping to persuade President Donald Trump to take a more active role in defending Ukraine against Russian aggression. Despite a warm reception, Merz was unable to obtain a firm commitment from Trump regarding increased U.S. involvement in supporting Ukraine. The meeting highlights the ongoing efforts by European leaders to encourage the U.S. to maintain its support for Ukraine in the face of continued Russian aggression. The lack of a concrete commitment underscores the complexities of international diplomacy and differing perspectives on addressing global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Some individuals using Ozempic and similar weight-loss drugs have reported experiencing changes in their sense of smell, with some developing cravings for sugary perfumes and scents. While Ozempic is known for gastrointestinal side effects, this olfactory phenomenon, dubbed "Ozempic smell," is a lesser-known effect. Experts suggest that the drug's impact on digestion may contribute to these changes in taste and smell perception, as the regions controlling these senses are linked to the hormone regulated by the medication. The rise in popularity of gourmand fragrances aligns with this trend, though further research is needed to establish a definitive link between GLP-1 medications and altered olfactory preferences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget bill includes significant cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially affecting millions of Americans. The bill aims to cut around $600 billion from Medicaid, potentially causing 10.9 million people to lose coverage over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. SNAP would face cuts of approximately $230 billion over 10 years, with Republicans aiming to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in these programs. The changes include work requirements, increased eligibility checks, and restrictions on funding for certain services, such as gender transition care and abortion providers. </p>

          <p>ICE arrests under President Trump's second term have surpassed 100,000, as federal agents intensify efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants. The increase is driven by demands from top administration officials to conduct a minimum of 3,000 arrests each day. ICE is holding around 54,000 immigrant detainees and is seeking additional funding to expand detention capacity. The agency has resorted to more aggressive tactics, including arrests at courthouses and worksites, leading to confrontations and outrage in some communities.</p>

          <p>A US State Department spokesperson defended President Donald Trump's travel ban, claiming that attendees of the upcoming World Cup and Olympics would support the restrictions. The ban restricts travel from 12 countries and partially restricts travel from seven others, citing deficiencies in each country's vetting procedures. The order contains an exception for athletes and members of athletic teams traveling for major sporting events. The article raises concerns about the impact of the ban on various individuals and events, including the Club World Cup and Gold Cup.</p>

          <p>Economists anticipate that Friday's jobs report will reveal a slowdown in hiring for May, with expectations of a gain of just 125,000 nonfarm payrolls. This is down from 177,000 in April and the year-to-date monthly average of 144,000. Concerns over higher tariffs and economic uncertainty are contributing to the anticipated slowdown. The report will be a key indicator of the labor market's strength and could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
