          <p>Coinbase reported that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data, potentially costing the company up to $400 million. The stolen data included sensitive information like names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, masked bank account numbers, and government ID images, but passwords and private keys were not compromised. Coinbase detected the breach independently, terminated the involved employees, and enhanced fraud monitoring protections. The company is cooperating with law enforcement and has established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminals, refusing to pay the ransom demand.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with reduced tariffs on China, the company may soon be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's trade levies are hindering Walmart's ability to maintain low prices, despite the retailer's efforts to absorb some costs. The price hikes are expected to take effect later this month, joining other large retailers in warning about increased prices due to tariffs. Walmart also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty, reporting a decrease in earnings compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy uncertainties. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. He cautioned that policy changes could create a difficult balancing act for the Fed between supporting employment and controlling inflation. While not directly mentioning President Trump's tariffs, Powell has previously noted their potential to slow growth and boost inflation.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after growing more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment. However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government aims to boost the economy but faces criticism over its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering the Trump administration's bid to narrow lower court orders blocking the president from ending birthright citizenship. The arguments focus on the authority of district court judges to issue sweeping injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation, rather than the legality of the executive order itself. The administration seeks to limit the injunctions to the 22 states, two organizations, and seven individuals who brought the lawsuits. A decision in favor of the administration could allow partial enforcement of the policy while litigation continues.</p>

          <p>Endurance athlete Lewis Pugh is attempting to swim around Martha's Vineyard, where 'Jaws' was filmed, to change public perception of sharks and advocate for their protection. Pugh aims to challenge the film's portrayal of sharks as villains and highlight their importance in maintaining ocean ecosystems. He will swim for several hours each day in the cold water, wearing only trunks, a cap, and goggles, while educating the public about shark conservation. The swim coincides with the 50th anniversary of 'Jaws' and follows the first confirmed great white shark sighting of the season in Massachusetts.</p>

          <h2>US-UK Trade Agreement Faces Hurdles Over Food Production Standards</h2>

          <p>The New York Times reports that the recent US-UK trade agreement, aimed at increasing American agricultural exports to Britain, faces challenges due to differing food production standards. While the US Secretary of Agriculture promotes the agreement, British consumers are wary of American meat, citing concerns over hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken. British regulations emphasize animal welfare and environmental protections, leading to higher costs and public resistance to changing these standards. This disagreement could impede a more comprehensive trade agreement and limit the increase of American exports to Britain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 09:34:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors reveals that homeownership is increasingly out of reach for middle-income families due to a shortage of affordable homes. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes beyond the price range of middle-class households. The lack of affordable homes is partly responsible for driving up prices, as buyers bid up prices to secure properties.</p>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that price hikes due to tariffs could begin later this month, despite the retailer beating earnings expectations. Rainey noted that even with reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the import taxes are still too high for retailers to absorb. The company expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating tariff policies. CEO Doug McMillon highlighted that tariffs on goods from China create the greatest cost pressure, particularly in categories like toys and electronics.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis. Deaths declined in all major categories of drug use and in most states. Public health experts attribute the decline to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, could jeopardize this progress. Despite the improvement, drug fatalities remain high, with 80,391 deaths in 2024.</p>

          <p>House Republicans, particularly those from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over raising or abolishing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The SALT deduction has become a major obstacle for Republicans trying to pass a tax proposal that extends President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. Some Republicans from high-tax states insist on raising the cap to provide relief to their constituents, while others oppose it. The House Ways and Means Committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved.</p>
