          <p>BP's chairman, Helge Lund, announced his upcoming resignation in 2026, following the company's strategic shift towards increased oil and gas investment.  This decision comes after BP's recent pivot away from renewable energy, a move that has faced criticism from activist investors.  The company's share price has also been affected by this strategic change and lagging performance compared to competitors. The succession process will be led by Amanda Blanc.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is halting over $500 million in federal funding to Brown University due to concerns about its handling of antisemitism on campus.
