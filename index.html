          <p>Beijing has lodged a formal protest with New Delhi after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly extended birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson stated that India should recognize the "separatist nature" of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader and stop using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs. The incident highlights the extreme sensitivity of the Tibet issue in Sino-Indian relations. Modi had posted a warm message on social media for the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, calling him an enduring symbol of love, compassion, and moral discipline.</p>

          <p>The jury has begun deliberations in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn baby, Victoria. The couple became the focus of a national manhunt in 2023 after evidence of a birth was found in a burnt-out car. Their baby was later discovered deceased in a shopping bag in Brighton, having died in a tent on the South Downs. While the pair were previously convicted on lesser charges, the original jury could not reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge, prompting this retrial.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a major tax and spending package into law, permanently extending the tax cuts first enacted in 2017. The legislation also introduces several new provisions aimed at various demographics, including a "bonus" for seniors, an increased state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a higher exemption for estate and gift taxes. Additionally, the bill creates new tax breaks for tip income and overtime pay, and establishes a new tax-advantaged savings account for children, significantly altering the U.S. tax landscape for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 82 deaths, with more than 40 people officially reported missing and potentially more unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically over the holiday weekend, overwhelming campgrounds, including Camp Mystic, where several children and a counselor are among the missing. A massive search and rescue operation is underway, involving state and federal agencies, after President Trump declared a major disaster for Kerr County. Officials are facing scrutiny regarding the timeliness of warnings for what they describe as an unprecedented weather event.</p>

          <p>A hiker who fell 26 feet into a crevasse on a Swiss glacier was saved with the help of his small, long-haired Chihuahua. The man, who became stuck in the ice, used a walkie-talkie to call for help, but rescuers were initially unable to pinpoint his location on the vast glacier. A helicopter rescue crew eventually spotted the tiny dog perched right beside the hole where its owner had fallen. Air Zermatt rescue service credited the dog's presence and behavior for leading them to the exact site, calling the chihuahua a hero for its role in the successful rescue.</p>

          <p>Fellow activists and organizers believe the recent arrest of Alfredo Juarez Zeferino, a prominent 25-year-old farm worker activist in Washington, was politically motivated. Juarez Zeferino, who played a key role in securing overtime pay and heat protections for farm workers, was detained by ICE agents in March based on an old deportation order he was reportedly unaware of. His colleagues argue his arrest is part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on labor organizers and political opponents.

The Fed chair is one of twelve voting members on the committee that sets rates, and the president has limited ability to appoint new members, making it difficult to force a policy change.

          <p>A top White House economic adviser has suggested that the upcoming deadline for new trade deals could be extended for countries that are negotiating "in good faith." While President Trump has threatened to impose higher tariffs, the administration may delay implementation for nations making progress, creating a two-tiered approach to the negotiations. This potential flexibility comes as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warns that the administration's tariff policies risk higher inflation and reduced competitiveness for American producers, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the future of U.S. trade relations.

          <h2>Analysts Urge China to Implement Bolder Measures to Combat Deflation and Weak Demand</h2>

          <p>Economists are calling for more decisive action from Chinese authorities to address the nation's persistent deflationary pressures and weak domestic demand. China's GDP deflator, a broad measure of prices, has been negative for over a year, and consumer prices have fallen for four consecutive months. Analysts from firms like CICC argue that attempts to revive inflation by cutting industrial supply have been insufficient. They contend that the root cause is weak demand, driven by downturns in the property sector and diminishing income expectations, requiring a stronger policy response to avert a deflationary spiral.

Huawei stated that its model was developed and trained entirely on its proprietary Ascend hardware platform. The company did acknowledge using certain open-source codes from other models but asserted that it strictly followed all licensing requirements, as it competes in China's burgeoning LLM field.</p>

          <p>Mexican prosecutors have alleged that boxer Julio César Chávez Jr, son of the legendary champion, served as a henchman for the Sinaloa cartel before his recent arrest in the U.S. An indictment claims Chávez Jr was directed by a cartel leader to physically assault rival gang members who had been captured, using them like a "punchbag." The information was reportedly gathered from intercepted phone calls. Chávez Jr, a former middleweight champion, was arrested by ICE in California for cartel affiliations and faces deportation, as well as an active arrest warrant in Mexico for organized crime.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Robert Reich argues that the Trump administration's recent actions against universities, such as forcing the resignation of the University of Virginia's president over DEI policies, are part of a broader, authoritarian strategy. Reich draws parallels to Viktor Orbán's methods in Hungary, suggesting the administration is using issues like DEI and antisemitism as pretexts to gain control over higher education. He posits that the ultimate goal is to suppress independent thought and critical inquiry, as an educated populace is the greatest obstacle to tyranny, making this a deliberate effort to close the American mind.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has commenced in Massachusetts challenging the Trump administration's efforts to deport foreign students based on their pro-Palestinian political speech. The lawsuit, brought by academic associations like the AAUP, argues that this "ideological-deportation policy" is unconstitutional and has created a climate of fear on campuses, chilling academic freedom. The government must now defend its position that it can deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy. The case is the first of several legal challenges to the administration's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism in higher education to reach trial.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," is a satirical take on the world of arts criticism, set during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story centers on Alex Lyons, a notoriously harsh theater critic whose career and life begin to unravel after he gives a one-star review to a show, then sleeps with its creator and star. The scorned performer transforms her show into a public takedown of Alex, which becomes a national sensation. This review praises the novel as a delightfully snackable read that explores the power dynamics and potential corruption inherent in the act of criticism.</p>

These thick-cut Kennebec potato fries undergo a meticulous three-step process of steaming, freezing, and frying, resulting in a uniquely crunchy exterior and a fluffy interior. Dressed with herbs and balsamic vinegar, they are presented as a potential candidate for the best fries in the city, capable of converting even the most ardent fat-fry skeptic.</p>
