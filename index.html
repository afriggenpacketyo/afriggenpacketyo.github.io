          <p>House Republicans are preparing to vote on a sweeping bill that extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts and raises the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion. The legislation also includes provisions for no taxes on tips or overtime, modifications to the state and local tax deduction (SALT), work requirements for Medicaid, and changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The bill aims to satisfy competing demands from fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans, though it faces unified opposition from Democrats and challenges in the Senate. If passed, the bill would prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, driven by factors like Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and thawing U.S.-China trade tensions. Bank of America and JPMorgan have expressed bullish views on emerging markets, citing attractive valuations and a weaker U.S. dollar. This shift reflects dented confidence in U.S. assets, leading to a divergence in performance between emerging market equities and U.S. stocks. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a potential rotation towards emerging markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has stated that the Trump administration "unquestionably" violated a court order by attempting to deport eight migrants to third countries, including South Sudan, without due process. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas carrying individuals from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam, but declined to confirm the flight's final destination. The judge ordered the administration to retain custody of the would-be deportees and provide them with "reasonable fear" interviews.

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are calling on the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins by charging extra for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. The groups argue that these practices breach EU consumer law and are seeking an investigation and sanctions. Ryanair and Norwegian have defended their policies, stating they comply with EU law, while other airlines referred to a statement by Airlines for Europe that the action would decrease consumer choice.</p>

          <p>Immigration continues to be a contentious issue in UK politics, with politicians struggling to address public concerns despite recent figures indicating a fall in net migration. The article explores the historical context of immigration in Britain, highlighting key events like the 1968 Race Relations Act and Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech, which shaped public attitudes. While attitudes towards immigration may be softening, concerns persist, particularly among working-class voters who feel the impact of migration on their communities. The current Labour government, elected on a manifesto promising to reduce migration, faces the challenge of finding a settlement on this complex issue.</p>

The ship slid off the ramp and became stuck after the flatcar failed to move alongside it, throwing off its balance and crushing parts of the ship’s bottom, according to the Korean Central News Agency. Kim blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for what he described as a “serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism,” and called for a ruling Workers’ Party meeting to address their “irresponsible errors,” KCNA said.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's commencement ceremony was punctuated by boos and protests as graduates expressed anger over campus lockdowns, arrests of pro-Palestinian protestors, and the administration's handling of recent events.

Students also protested the detention of a fellow graduate by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ceremony took place amid heightened tensions, with the Trump administration pulling federal funding due to concerns over antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a $100 million lawsuit against multiple Southern California law firms and attorneys, accusing them of engaging in a racketeering scheme to collect inflated legal fees under the state's Lemon Law. Ford alleges the lawyers violated the RICO Act by inflating billing hours and claiming work that never happened. The lawsuit claims that attorneys took advantage of a law designed to protect consumers with faulty products by billing more hours than they worked. One attorney is alleged to have billed over 24 hours per day on multiple occasions.</p>

The NYPD, facing a shortage of officers, is investigating the matter.

Trump played a video and cited claims of land seizures and mass killings, prompting a tense exchange with Ramaphosa, who disputed the claims and emphasized that crime affects all races. The meeting, intended to improve relations, instead highlighted divisions and drew criticism for Trump's amplification of misinformation. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." The waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than the federal government, including a mandate to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact cities and states that have adopted California's standards.</p>

          <p>Sea temperatures around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas up to 4C warmer than normal, causing a marine heatwave. The heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and parts of Cornwall and Devon. Climate change is warming oceans globally, making these events more likely, with scientists expecting 2025 to be one of the hottest years on record. The heatwave could affect marine life, disrupt breeding patterns, and potentially cause blooms of harmful algae.</p>

They acknowledged challenges related to land expropriation and dysfunctional government policies, but emphasized that the land must be shared by both Black and White people and there is no systemic genocide in play.</p>

The White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut funding for about $1 billion worth of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, resulting in a 40% budget reduction for Feeding South Florida. The cuts have led to empty shelves, longer lines at food distribution sites, and concerns about farmers being unable to process surplus produce for families in need.
