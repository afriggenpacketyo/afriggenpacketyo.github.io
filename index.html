          <p>This article discusses the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's potential acceptance of a luxury Boeing aircraft from Qatar as a gift to replace Air Force One. Critics argue this could violate gift rules for US presidents and raise conflict of interest concerns, particularly given Trump's business ties. Trump defended the arrangement, stating it would be a temporary gift to the Defense Department, saving taxpayer money. Qatar has disputed reports describing the jet as a gift, and the article highlights the legal and ethical debates surrounding the situation. The article provides context on Trump's long-standing dissatisfaction with the current Air Force One planes and his previous attempts to procure new aircraft. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has been engaged in a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle has achieved its goals and further progress can be made through political means. The move is seen as a significant step towards peace and stability in the region, and it could influence other Kurdish militias. The Turkish government acknowledges this as a positive development and hopes for a "terror-free Turkey," though the long-term implications for Kurdish rights remain uncertain.

          <p>Police in New Zealand have "paused" the search for Eli Sweeting, a 25-year-old British hiker who has been missing for over a week. Sweeting was reported missing on May 4 after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak on the South Island. Despite a large-scale search involving local volunteers, helicopters, and search dogs, authorities made the difficult decision to pause efforts. Police are reviewing their efforts to determine if any further action can be taken, while the family acknowledges the challenging terrain. Optimism score is 10.</p>

          <p>Despite declining domestic consumption in Japan's sake industry, Kenbishi, the country's oldest sake brand, remains committed to traditional brewing methods. Kenbishi's president, Masataka Shirakashi, believes tradition is essential for maintaining quality and hopes UNESCO recognition will encourage a revival of sake consumption in Japan. The brewery uses traditional wooden tools and equipment, such as dakidaru, despite the greater financial cost and maintenance. Shirakashi emphasizes the responsibility to protect the taste of Kenbishi sake and preserve Japan's cultural heritage. Optimism score is 60.</p>
