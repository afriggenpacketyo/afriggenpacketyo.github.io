          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation using secret filming has exposed a massive £28 million timeshare fraud that targeted over 3,500 elderly victims. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), used high-pressure tactics to sell useless "credits" to people desperate to exit their timeshare contracts, funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners. Following the BBC's 2016 report, a lengthy police investigation led to 14 convictions, bringing some closure to the victims who lost significant sums of money. The Crown Prosecution Service is now working to recover the illicitly gained assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Betfred's co-founder and chairman, Fred Done, has warned that a potential increase in gambling taxes by Chancellor Rachel Reeves could force the closure of all 1,287 of the company's high street shops. Such a move would jeopardize 7,500 jobs, which Done describes as the "biggest threat" to the industry in his 57-year career. This warning follows similar statements from other betting companies as the government considers raising taxes on the sector. Done argues that increased taxes would make the business unprofitable and push betting activity to untaxed offshore operators.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made significant progress in combating desertification in the arid Ningxia region, successfully pushing back the Mu Us Desert by more than 20 kilometers. The Baijitan National Nature Reserve has been instrumental in this effort, implementing sand control and afforestation across thousands of hectares to protect the regional capital of Yinchuan. This large-scale environmental project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the Yellow River and local agriculture. The success showcases a major achievement in ecological restoration and land management.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor recounts her experience investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski, a case that led her back to her small Pennsylvania hometown. The investigation revealed that the victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former high school classmate of the reporter. Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, but questions about Snyder's potential involvement were raised during the trial, where she invoked her Fifth Amendment right. In an exclusive interview, Snyder denied any role in the murder, stating she had no knowledge of Holbrook's plans.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and violating Colombia's sovereignty following a U.S. strike on a boat in its territorial waters. Petro stated that the vessel, carrying a fisherman with no drug trade ties, was adrift with a distress signal when it was attacked. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's confirmation that the U.S. had struck a "drug-carrying submarine," killing two people. This incident is the latest in a series of U.S. strikes in the Caribbean aimed at curbing drug flow, actions which UN experts have described as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on Palestinian civilians within Gaza. A State Department statement declared that such an act would be a "direct and grave" violation of the current ceasefire agreement and would undermine recent progress made through mediation. Hamas has denied the allegation, although it has been re-establishing control in Gaza, leading to clashes. Washington has informed other ceasefire guarantors and stated that measures will be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview and in her new memoir, former Vice President Kamala Harris stated that former President Joe Biden made a "big mistake" by not inviting Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a 2021 White House event focused on electric vehicles. The event featured executives from unionized automakers like GM and Ford, and Musk's exclusion was widely seen as a nod to the United Auto Workers, as Tesla is non-union. Harris argued that presidents should set aside political loyalties to recognize technological innovation, suggesting the snub alienated Musk, who later became a significant financial backer for Donald Trump.</p>

Ms. Giuffre, who alleged she was forced to have sex with the prince, settled a civil case against him in 2022, and her brother has now called for King Charles to strip Andrew of his "prince" title.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool is experiencing a difficult spell, with analysts pointing to the tactical void left by Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. The article suggests his absence is felt beyond obvious goal contributions, particularly in the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Alexander-Arnold's unique skill set, including his ambidextrous long passing and ability to switch play, provided tactical solutions that the current squad struggles to replicate. As a result, new signings like Florian Wirtz are being used in deeper, less effective roles.</p>

Critics argue that AI has become a convenient "scapegoat" for layoffs that may be due to other factors, such as over-hiring during the pandemic or general economic slowdowns. Fabian Stephany of the Oxford Internet Institute suggests firms may be using the AI narrative to appear innovative while masking miscalculations in their workforce strategy. This trend is fueling employee anxiety, even as recent data from the U.S. labor market shows little evidence of mass job disruption from AI so far.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by both hormonal changes and psychological factors. According to psychologist Andrea Seiferth, the initial passion fueled by certain hormones gives way to the bonding hormone oxytocin, which can dampen sex drive. For women, sexual satisfaction is particularly crucial, as unmet needs can lead to sexual distress and a lower libido. Open communication, prioritizing non-sexual physical affection, and understanding the difference between physical and psychological arousal are key for couples to maintain intimacy over the long term.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans suffered a significant setback to their College Football Playoff hopes, losing 34-24 to the 13th-ranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish in a rain-drenched game. USC's run defense struggled, allowing 306 rushing yards, while its own offense was hampered by costly mistakes, including two fourth-quarter interceptions and a critical fumble on a failed trick play. Coach Lincoln Riley took responsibility for several "stupid" play calls that put his team in poor positions. The loss marks a crucial blow, leaving USC with no margin for error for the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has strongly criticized the Trump administration after a military live-fire demonstration forced the temporary closure of a major section of Interstate 5 on Saturday. Newsom called the event, which celebrated the U.S. Marines' 250th anniversary and was attended by Vice President JD Vance, an "absurd show of force" that put public safety at risk. State officials closed the highway due to the danger of live munitions being fired over the busy corridor. Marine officials countered that the exercise was routine and the closure was unnecessary, highlighting escalating political tensions.</p>
