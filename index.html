          <p>In November 2021, Leslie Reeves went on a first date with Chris Smith, whom she met online, but the date ended tragically when both were shot in Smith's home. Reeves was found dead, shot in the head, while Smith was barely conscious with a bullet in his brain. Investigators suspected Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who friends said she feared, and license plate readers placed his car near the crime scene. Tarr initially denied being in the area but later admitted to being at Smith's house, claiming Reeves asked him to follow her there. Ultimately, Tarr was found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder, and sentenced to 85 years. </p>

          <p>Germany plans to significantly increase its defense spending, aiming to have the strongest conventional army in Europe, signaling a historic shift in security policy.

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws, calling it "criminal" and a "betrayal" of artists. He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment amounts to theft and threatens the livelihoods of young artists who lack the resources to fight big tech companies. The government's rejection of proposals to ensure copyright holders' permission is required for AI use has sparked outrage in the music industry, with warnings that it could crush the next generation of creators. John vows to fight the decision in court if necessary. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dust from parched farmland. The extreme dryness of the soil contributed to the severity of the storm, creating a dramatic scene as the dust cloud rolled into Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. The event is considered unusual, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era. </p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, survived for weeks by foraging for wild leeks and melting snow for water after being trapped by an avalanche. Slaton, a nutritionist, recounted how she splinted her leg after a fall and used her knowledge of foraging to sustain herself. She lost her tent and sleeping bags, relying only on a lighter and a knife. She was eventually found in a cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, who noted that Slaton had endured 13 heavy snowstorms. </p>

These refugees were among the Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, and their return is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR. </p>

While the U.S. maintains ties with Israel, Trump's focus on the Gulf States and his willingness to act without consulting Netanyahu indicate a new dynamic in the region. </p>
