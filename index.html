          <p>Former Arsenal player Thomas Partey has been officially charged with five counts of sexual assault, with the alleged offenses involving three different women between 2021 and 2022. The 32-year-old Ghanaian international, whose contract with the club recently ended, has denied all charges and stated through his lawyer that he welcomes the chance to clear his name. The charges were brought following a lengthy investigation by the Metropolitan Police that began in February 2022. He is scheduled to appear in court in early August to face the allegations.</p>

          <p>Following the passage of a massive tax and policy bill, Republicans and Democrats are engaged in a battle to shape public perception. Republicans are promoting the legislation's permanent tax cuts, increased defense spending, and funding for border security. Conversely, Democrats are highlighting estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which projects the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit and cause millions to lose health coverage through cuts to programs like Medicaid. Polling indicates that a majority of voters currently oppose the bill, though many admit to not fully understanding its contents.</p>

          <p>The leader of one of Sweden's most prominent criminal organizations, Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey following an international warrant. Abdo, head of the Rumba gang, is accused of orchestrating a wave of violent crime in Sweden from abroad, contributing to the country's struggle with organized crime. His arrest is the result of extended cooperation between Turkish and Swedish authorities. This development occurs amidst a violent feud between Abdo's group and the rival Foxtrot network, which has intensified gang-related violence in the once low-crime nation.</p>

          <p>A severe thunderstorm with high winds struck central New Jersey, resulting in multiple fatalities and causing significant destruction in the towns of Plainfield and North Plainfield. In response to the tragedy and widespread damage, the mayor of Plainfield declared a state of emergency and canceled the town's Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks. Governor Phil Murphy urged residents to remain indoors due to dangers from downed power lines and toppled trees. The community is now focused on recovery efforts rather than celebration.</p>

          <p>After 42 years, a man has been indicted for murder in the 1983 disappearance of his former girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, in Selma, Oregon. The case went cold until a human skull found in 1997 was recently identified as Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. This breakthrough in the investigation led a grand jury to indict her then-boyfriend, 72-year-old Mark Sanfratello, on a murder charge. Sanfratello was located and detained in California and is now awaiting extradition to Oregon to face the charges related to the decades-old case.</p>

          <p>Leaders from the European Union and Germany have proposed creating an alternative to the World Trade Organization (WTO), arguing the current body is dysfunctional due to the US blocking its dispute resolution mechanism. The new initiative would aim to form a strategic alliance with like-minded nations, starting with the CPTPP trade bloc, to promote open markets and fair competition rules. This move is seen as a direct response to what they view as rising US protectionism and market-distorting industrial subsidies from China, effectively creating a new trade framework without either superpower.

          <h2>Broad US Tariffs on Foreign Imports Poised to Increase as 90-Day Freeze Expires</h2>

          <p>A 90-day moratorium on sweeping U.S. tariffs is scheduled to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new bilateral trade deals are not finalized, country-specific duties will be added on top of the current 10% baseline tariff on all imports, potentially triggering a new wave of inflation. While the Trump administration has announced deals with China and the U.K., the status of agreements with dozens of other countries remains unknown, leaving open the possibility of sharply higher costs on billions of dollars in foreign goods.

          <p>At the Magna Roman Fort near Hadrian's Wall in northern England, archaeologists have unearthed a collection of 'unusually large' 2,000-year-old shoes. Among the discoveries are eight shoes over 30cm long, with one reaching a modern US size 15, a size range that is exceptionally rare for the Roman period. Researchers from the Vindolanda Charity Trust are now trying to determine who might have worn such large footwear. They are investigating the history of the diverse Roman regiments stationed at the fort, which drew soldiers from across the vast empire.</p>

          <p>The trial has begun for two brothers accused of assaulting three police officers during a brawl at Manchester Airport. Prosecutors told the jury that the incident, which was captured on CCTV, started after one of the brothers, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, headbutted and punched a man in a Starbucks cafe. When police later approached the brothers to make an arrest, they allegedly resisted and violently assaulted the officers, with one officer suffering a broken nose. The defendants deny the charges, claiming they were acting in self-defense during the altercation.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Race to Secure Passports for US-Born Children of Haitian Immigrants</h2>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are in a race against time to help Haitian immigrant parents obtain US passports for their American-born children. This urgent effort is driven by fears that the Trump administration will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians, potentially leading to deportations. Without proper documentation for their children, parents face the risk of family separation or their children becoming effectively stateless. The situation highlights the deep anxiety within immigrant communities over the administration's increasingly stringent immigration policies and enforcement actions.</p>
