            <p>Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, has consolidated power by dismantling democratic checks and balances, controlling media, civil society, and universities. Critics allege corruption and cronyism, with Orban using EU funds to enrich loyal associates. The government targeted the media early on, approving deals for Orban-linked individuals to take over media companies and purging unfriendly voices from public media. Independent media outlets face funding challenges and limited access to government events, highlighting the erosion of press freedom.</p>

            <p>While tongue-scraping has gained popularity as a means of dental health, some experts warn of potential heart health risks. The practice can cause microscopic cuts on the tongue, potentially introducing bacteria into the bloodstream and increasing the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. Overdoing tongue-scraping can also lower nitric oxide levels, potentially leading to high blood pressure. Experts recommend moderation and emphasize that tongue-scraping should not replace regular brushing and flossing.</p>

            <p>China rarely criticises or takes sides in African conflicts, but recent insurgency in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has shown a measured shift in Beijing’s approach. So far this year, on at least two occasions, Beijing – through its UN ambassador, Fu Cong – has directly asked Kigali to end its backing of the M23 rebel group and pull Rwandan troops out of the DRC. China also voted in favour of a UN Security Council resolution that unanimously condemned Rwanda’s role in the conflict . This is a departure from the norm: China mostly abstains in resolutions that involve conflicts between its key allies.</p>

            <p>China is taking a more active role in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda conflict, urging Rwanda to end its support for the M23 rebel group. This shift reflects China's desire to protect its significant mining interests in the region and maintain relationships with both countries. While China typically avoids taking sides in African conflicts, its direct engagement and support for UN resolutions condemning Rwanda's actions demonstrate a measured departure from its non-interference policy.</p>

He also mentioned that Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a surprise one-day ceasefire in Ukraine on Saturday for Easter - which falls on the same day this year for Orthodox and Western churches.</p>
