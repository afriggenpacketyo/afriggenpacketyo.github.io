          <h2>Louisiana's Investment in Meta Data Center Faces Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 08:08:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's decision to build a $10 billion data center in Louisiana has sparked debate over the economic benefits versus the costs to the state. The project, set to be the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere, promises to transform Louisiana's economy and create 500 permanent jobs, with a temporary surge to 5,000 during construction. However, the state had to offer significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption, to secure the deal. Concerns are also raised about the massive energy consumption of the data center, which will require the construction of three new gas-fired power plants. Optimism about the project's long-term impact is tempered by the potential environmental and financial burdens on the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are stuck in a holding pattern due to economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts, showing minimal movement despite significant global events. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slightly increased to 6.88%, offering little incentive to potential homebuyers. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes dropped slightly, remaining historically low due to inflated house prices and limited supply. While refinance applications saw a rise, overall market activity remains subdued, indicating a lack of significant momentum in the housing sector.</p>

          <p>Tesla's European car sales have declined for the fifth consecutive month in May, with a 27.9% year-on-year drop, as consumers shift towards cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. This decline has resulted in a decrease in Tesla's European market share, falling from 1.8% to 1.2%. While the revamped Model Y was expected to boost sales, Tesla continues to face increasing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese companies like BYD. The article notes that Tesla's stock has also decreased by more than 15% year-to-date, reflecting the challenges the company faces in the European market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, though both sides were accused of violating it shortly after its supposed commencement. Despite initial frustration and accusations, Trump intervened, leading to a cessation of bombardments after a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem reopened, and airport restrictions were lifted, but travel limitations for government employees remained. The ceasefire followed a 12-day conflict with significant casualties, and the U.S. took military action against Iranian nuclear sites before the truce.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S. strikes had completely destroyed Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon assessment suggesting limited damage. Trump dismissed the report, claiming Iran had no chance to relocate enriched uranium before the strikes and that the program was set back decades. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio supported Trump's position, alleging the report's leak was politically motivated. Democratic senators called for transparency and a return to negotiations with Iran, highlighting the need for answers on the actual impact of the strikes.</p>

          <p>Households in the UK are struggling with billions of pounds in unpaid council tax as bills are expected to rise further in the coming years. Figures show that Â£6.6bn is owed to local authorities in England alone, with an additional Â£642m added in the past year. Campaigners are advocating for a more compassionate approach to debt collection, rather than resorting to bailiffs. The government is considering changes to debt collection rules, but also anticipates a 5% annual increase in council tax, exacerbating the financial strain on struggling families.</p>

          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program is still being assessed, with initial reports suggesting the core components were not destroyed. A leaked Defence Intelligence Agency assessment indicates the strikes may have only set back Iran's efforts by months, rather than years. Intelligence agencies are using various methods, including satellite imagery and intercepted communications, to develop a clearer picture of the damage. The movement of Iranian nuclear materials before the attack raises concerns about the potential for the program to be reconstituted at new sites, intensifying the need for continued monitoring.</p>

          <p>The British pound is currently at its highest level in over three years, prompting differing opinions among analysts regarding its potential for further gains. While some attribute the pound's strength to dollar weakness and recovery from the 2022 mini-budget crisis, others suggest its upward momentum may be limited. Forecasts vary, with some predicting continued dollar weakness and a rise to $1.40, while others anticipate a decline to $1.30 due to macroeconomic factors and potential Bank of England rate cuts.

          <p>Pride Month 2025 in Washington, D.C., was marked by emotional whiplash, reflecting a broader trend of backlash against LGBTQ rights. Despite the 10th anniversary of the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, attendance at WorldPride was lower than expected, and concerns about encroaching conservative policies loomed. Gen Z, the queerest generation, faces the erosion of their status quo, with increasing homophobic rhetoric, challenges to transgender rights, and corporations withdrawing Pride support. The article suggests that this generation is drawing on radical elders for inspiration to counter discrimination.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are nearing passage of a budget bill that includes significant Medicaid cuts, potentially leading to millions of Americans losing their health insurance. The legislation could reduce Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine estimates that these coverage losses could lead to thousands of additional annual deaths. The proposed work requirements and limits on state financing tools are expected to worsen Americans' health, particularly for low-income and minority populations.</p>

          <p>Craig Wood, a British Army veteran and triple amputee, has made history by becoming the first person with his condition to sail solo across the Pacific Ocean. Wood, who lost both legs and his left hand in Afghanistan, sailed approximately 13,000 kilometers from Mexico to Hiroshima, Japan, over 90 days. He hopes his achievement will inspire others, particularly those living with limb loss, to challenge perceptions of disability. Wood also plans to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum to reflect on the impact of war.</p>
