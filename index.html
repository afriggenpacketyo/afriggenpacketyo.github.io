          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has successfully discovered a significant uranium deposit at a record-breaking depth, marking a major advancement in the nation's resource exploration capabilities. The discovered sandstone-type uranium is generally larger and more cost-effective to mine compared to other sources. This breakthrough is crucial for China, which is heavily reliant on uranium imports to fuel its expanding nuclear power sector and maintain its nuclear weapons program. The discovery highlights China's progress in securing critical energy resources domestically.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to debut on the Nasdaq, aiming to become a leading public vehicle for institutional investment in ether, similar to MicroStrategy's role with bitcoin. The firm plans to differentiate itself by actively generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security and operations. Backed by major crypto investors, the company argues that staking makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, offering a form of dividend that ether ETFs currently do not provide.

          <p>At least 85 Palestinians were reportedly killed in Gaza while attempting to access humanitarian aid convoys, marking one of the deadliest days for aid-seekers in the ongoing conflict. The largest death toll occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses claim Israeli forces fired on crowds. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a threatening mob and that casualty numbers are being investigated. The event highlights the escalating violence and catastrophic humanitarian crisis facing Gaza's population as aid distribution becomes increasingly perilous.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane was on a converging course and that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar at that airport, had not provided a warning. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a state fair flyover. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which was described by the pilot as an unusual and startling event.</p>

New analysis shows nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving into a private pension. The Department for Work and Pensions projects that those retiring in 2050 will be 8% worse off annually. The commission will explore ways to boost private savings, alongside a separate review of the state pension age. (not investment advice)</p>
