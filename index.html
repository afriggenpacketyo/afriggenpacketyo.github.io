          <h2>Trump's Remittance Tax Plan Faces Criticism for Potential Impact on African Economies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed tax on remittances leaving the U.S. is drawing criticism for its potential impact on African economies. The tax, included in President Trump's tax bill, would levy a percentage on financial transfers made by non-U.S. citizens or nationals. Experts warn that this could significantly affect remittance flows into Africa, which totaled over $92 billion in 2024, with the U.S. being a major source. Critics argue the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to avoid it, ultimately harming lower-income groups who rely on these funds for essential expenses like food, accommodation, and medical care. Optimism among African economies could be affected due to the uncertainty of the tax bill's impact.</p>

He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the current 25%, citing national security concerns. While Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, Trump emphasized the importance of a strong domestic steel industry for national security.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine, Sergeant Major Jody Armentrout, restrained a man who allegedly tried to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Tokyo to Houston. Armentrout noticed the man acting suspiciously and intervened when he grabbed the exit door. With the help of a passenger and flight attendants, Armentrout used zip ties to restrain the man. The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken for medical evaluation; a second unruly passenger was also removed from the flight after punching a bathroom door.</p>
