          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese officials in Geneva to discuss de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries. The article indicates that the meeting is unlikely to produce a major breakthrough, but there is hope for scaling back tariffs to relieve financial markets. President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs to 80%, but the Chinese side insists on mutual respect and benefit. The talks are occurring amid concerns that the trade war is harming the global economy, and any reduction in tariffs would be a positive signal to the markets.</p>
