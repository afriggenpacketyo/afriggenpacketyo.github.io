          <p>President Trump has directed the Commerce Department to develop a new U.S. census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from its count, a move that could significantly impact congressional representation and federal funding distribution. The proposed census would utilize data from the 2024 presidential election. This directive follows previous, unsuccessful attempts by the administration to alter the census, such as adding a citizenship question, and comes amid ongoing Republican efforts in Texas to redraw congressional maps.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, labeling him as "highly conflicted" in a post on Truth Social. This call follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's chairman, which raised concerns about Tan's reported investments and business connections to numerous Chinese companies, including some with alleged ties to the Chinese military. The president's statement prompted a more than 4% drop in Intel's premarket stock value.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, is formally questioning Google and YouTube about their discussions with President Trump's legal team. The inquiry centers on whether a potential settlement of Trump's censorship lawsuit against YouTube could be part of a "quid-pro-quo" arrangement for more favorable treatment from the administration. The senators expressed concern that such a deal could allow Google to evade accountability in separate federal antitrust, labor, and consumer protection lawsuits it currently faces.</p>

Under the agreement, the UK will return one migrant to France for each approved asylum seeker it accepts from there. On the first day of implementation, 155 migrants arrived, with an undisclosed number being transferred to immigration removal centers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the first returns to France could happen within weeks, despite potential legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate marked by inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace rising costs. While national average CD yields are modest, online banks are providing significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term accounts. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, means that CDs with terms of around one year often have better rates than longer-term ones, prompting some to use strategies like CD laddering.

          <p>High-yield savings accounts are presented as a strong option for building an emergency fund, offering interest rates that significantly outperform traditional accounts and help protect savings from inflation. While the national average rate remains low, top high-yield accounts, often from online banks with lower overhead costs, are offering rates over 4%. Experts advise savers to compare different online offerings to maximize their returns, noting that many such accounts have low or no minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees.

          <p>India's government and markets have reacted calmly to the U.S. announcement of a 50% tariff on its goods, a move intended to pressure New Delhi over its continued oil trade with Russia. Analysts and officials widely view the tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and the move has unexpectedly unified India's political opposition behind the government's stance. While certain sectors like jewelry and textiles face significant impacts, India's large domestic market and willingness to find diplomatic middle ground suggest it may wait for a resolution rather than making immediate concessions.

          <p>A wildfire in the Aude region of southern France, the country's largest in 75 years, continues to burn despite the efforts of over 2,000 firefighters. The blaze has scorched an area larger than Paris, resulting in one death, multiple injuries, and the destruction of dozens of homes. While lower temperatures and calmer winds have slowed its spread, officials state it is not yet under control. Residents of evacuated villages have been urged not to return home as firefighting operations, including water-bombing aircraft, continue.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's crucial semiconductor industry is facing significant pressure from the U.S. government's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported chips. The policy is designed to compel companies to establish manufacturing operations within the United States. While industry giant TSMC may be exempt due to its massive investment in Arizona facilities, other firms in Taiwan's extensive tech supply chain are now grappling with the difficult choice of either paying steep tariffs or undertaking costly relocations to maintain access to the American market.

          <p>Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, has lowered its annual operating profit forecast by over $4 billion, citing the significant impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Although its quarterly revenue topped estimates, operating profit fell 11% year-on-year, with the company attributing a substantial portion of the loss directly to the tariffs. The move highlights the financial pressure on Japanese automakers, who have been forced to absorb costs and cut prices to remain competitive in the U.S. market since the 25% vehicle import tariffs were enacted.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the profound and often overlooked experience of sibling loss, described as a form of "disenfranchised grief." The author reflects on losing her 18-year-old brother in a car accident when she was 16, and how that loss has shaped her identity and perception of time for over three decades. The piece delves into the complexities of a contentious sibling relationship cut short, the guilt that follows, and the challenge of defining oneself in the absence of a sibling, creating a permanent state of being an "after-only" child.</p>
