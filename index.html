          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a boost in March, marking the third consecutive month of growth, primarily driven by increased demand for clothing and DIY products attributed to warmer weather. The Office for National Statistics reported a 0.4% rise in sales volumes across various sectors, however, food sales, particularly in supermarkets, continued to struggle. Despite this positive trend, analysts caution that consumer confidence dipped in April, suggesting the recent sales upswing might soon end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the number of foreign nationals residing in Japan reaches record levels, foreigner associations are urging Japanese politicians and the public to recognize their contributions and address shortcomings in immigration policies. These associations emphasize the need to move beyond viewing foreigners solely as a source of labor and to create forums where their voices can be heard. Concerns raised include the protection of religious needs, particularly for the Muslim population, and the difficulties faced by technical interns in rural areas. Advocates stress that a clear immigration policy is essential for harmonious coexistence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council suggests that the United States may overestimate its leverage in tariff negotiations with China. Beijing has been preparing for potential tariff escalations since mid-2018 and doesn't view a trade deal with the US as urgently as Washington might believe. A key misjudgment is underestimating China's reluctance to be perceived as being bullied on the world stage, with Beijing viewing US tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain China's growth.</p>

          <p>A government survey in Japan reveals that 35% of local government officials have experienced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents. This is more than three times higher than the rate found in private-sector studies. The survey highlights the challenges faced by public servants who must provide services to everyone, leading to unreasonable requests. Efforts are being made to protect workers from such abuse, with the government considering measures to establish clear rules and complaint systems.</p>

          <p>Migrants subject to removal from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act are given only 12 hours to decide if they want to contest their removal. Lawyers argue this is insufficient time to seek legal counsel and prepare a challenge. The ACLU contends the time period violates a Supreme Court order requiring a "reasonable time" for detainees to argue against removal. The government has been using the wartime act to send Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador's prison known as CECOT.</p>
