          <p>Following a public dispute with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has announced the formation of the "America Party," a new third-party political venture. Musk, who has been a vocal critic of the bill, argues that the country needs an alternative to the current two-party system to give voters a genuine voice. However, creating a new national party is a formidable challenge, requiring navigation of complex state-by-state ballot access laws, substantial financial investment, and the ability to withstand legal challenges from established parties. Experts suggest that even for the world's wealthiest person, building a viable third party would be a multi-year project.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has issued a warning to its trading partners, including the European Union, to finalize new trade agreements by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that letters are being sent to notify countries of the impending deadline, stating that duties could return to their higher April levels. This "maximum pressure" strategy is intended to accelerate negotiations, with the administration claiming it is close to securing several new deals. The European Union is continuing to negotiate but has stated it is prepared to implement retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if an agreement is not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, a man accused of conspiring in the bombing of a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide and has raised concerns about conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park, who allegedly supplied materials for the attack, died in federal custody, effectively closing the only prosecution in the case. His death comes amid other reports from attorneys about inhumane conditions, including unmet medical needs and food shortages at the facility. A recent Justice Department report had already highlighted significant shortcomings in the Bureau of Prisons' emergency response protocols at various institutions.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 79 deaths and left more than 41 people missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically early Friday, devastating areas including Camp Mystic, a summer camp where multiple campers and a counselor are still unaccounted for. In response to the widespread destruction, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, which experienced the majority of the fatalities. Search and rescue operations are continuing around the clock, with officials acknowledging the difficulty in accounting for everyone, including numerous campers and RV travelers who were in the area.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA), a foundational pact signed in 1979, is at a critical juncture, reflecting the broader tensions in the bilateral relationship. Expert Denis Simon explains that the agreement, which once symbolized peaceful engagement and fostered immense scientific collaboration, is now viewed through a lens of national security and economic competition. The openness that was its strength is now perceived by some as a vulnerability due to concerns over espionage and intellectual property theft. The ongoing debate over renewing the STA is highly sensitive, as its future will signal the direction of engagement between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>In 2007, long before his presidency, Donald Trump launched a line of premium steaks, burgers, and hot dogs under the brand "Trump Steaks." The products, marketed as "The World's Greatest Steaks," were exclusively sold through the Sharper Image catalog and the QVC shopping channel. Despite being certified USDA Prime and sourced from a reputable supplier, the brand failed to gain traction with consumers. After just two months of poor sales, the products were discontinued.

          <p>England's Test cricket team is facing scrutiny over familiar issues following a crushing 336-run defeat to India at Edgbaston, a result that came just a week after a sensational victory.

Key players like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley continue to struggle with consistency, while the bowling attack showed signs of fatigue.

          <p>A vessel in the Red Sea was attacked by multiple small boats on Sunday, marking the first such reported incident in months. The attack occurred approximately 51 nautical miles southwest of Hodeidah, a key Yemeni port controlled by the Iranian-backed Houthis. According to maritime security group UKMTO, the small vessels opened fire on the ship, and an onboard security team returned fire during an hours-long engagement. This incident raises alarms about a potential resurgence of Houthi attacks on shipping, which had largely ceased in recent months following a period of intense activity and responsive U.S. airstrikes earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning. The National Hurricane Center has canceled tropical storm warnings for the coast, but concerns about heavy rain and potential flash flooding remain for parts of the Carolinas. The system is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches, as it moves into central and eastern North Carolina through Monday. Authorities had warned residents of the possibility of minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes as the storm approached the coastline.</p>

          <p>A multi-vehicle accident in Herriman, Utah, ended in a dramatic explosion after an SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant and ruptured a gas line. Two occupants of the SUV were rescued by bystanders just minutes before the vehicle and building were engulfed in flames. Video from the scene shows firefighters battling the blaze when a large explosion sends debris flying into the air. While multiple people from the initial crash were hospitalized, no one was inside the building at the time, and no injuries were reported from the explosion itself, which destroyed the restaurant.</p>

          <p>Buried within the new "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is a provision described as a major victory for the anti-abortion movement, which will bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. This applies not only to abortion services but to all healthcare they provide, including vaccinations, prenatal care, and cancer screenings. Health policy experts warn this will have a devastating impact on reproductive healthcare, particularly in underserved communities where Planned Parenthood is the only accessible provider. Activists express concern that such measures represent a coordinated effort to roll back access to essential care for millions of patients.</p>

          <p>A form of real estate fraud known as "quit claim deed" or "title theft" has resulted in New Hampshire homeowners losing over $4 million between 2019 and 2023. Scammers forge property transfer documents for vacant lands, vacation homes, or properties owned by the elderly, then record them with the county to sell or mortgage the property without the true owner's knowledge. The FBI reports that these "title pirates" often use public records to identify targets and can exploit remote closing processes. To protect themselves, homeowners are advised to consider title insurance, register for county filing alerts, and regularly check on unoccupied properties.</p>

          <p>In response to Elon Musk's announcement of a new "America Party," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the billionaire should stay out of politics and concentrate on his business ventures. Bessent remarked that while the principles of Musk's former government efficiency department were popular, Musk himself was not, according to polling. The secretary speculated that the boards of directors at companies like Tesla and SpaceX would likely disapprove of Musk's new political focus and encourage him to return to running his companies. This reaction highlights the growing rift between Musk and the Trump administration following their collaboration earlier in the year.</p>

Speaking on "Face the Nation," Hassett indicated that a number of agreements have been negotiated and that countries without advanced deals will receive letters outlining the U.S. position. He suggested that existing deals with the U.K. and Vietnam are serving as models for other negotiations. While expressing confidence, Hassett left open the possibility that the president could extend the deadline for key partners, emphasizing that the final judgment rests with President Trump.

Spanish journalists describe him as a player who excels in all aspects of the midfield role and has the potential to develop even further in the Premier League. Zubimendi is likely to join Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard in Arsenal's midfield, filling a pivotal role previously occupied by the recently departed Thomas Partey.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas underscore the difficulties in predicting rare and intense weather events, a challenge exacerbated by the climate crisis. While the National Weather Service issued timely warnings, including a top-level flash flood emergency, the rainfall's magnitude—equivalent to a 1-in-1,000-year event in some areas—surpassed initial forecasts. Experts note that while current technology can anticipate the potential for extreme rain in a region, pinpointing the exact location and severity remains a major hurdle. This event also brings attention to the impact of staffing shortages at federal weather agencies on their ability to improve forecasting models.</p>
