          <p>A self-imposed deadline for a new trade agreement between the United States and Canada has passed without a resolution, continuing a six-month tariff war. Despite intense negotiations, significant disagreements remain, with both leaders signaling that a quick deal is unlikely. While businesses seek certainty, Canadian negotiators are prioritizing a quality agreement over a rushed one, buffered partially by the existing CUSMA/USMCA deal which allows many exports to cross duty-free. The standoff persists as both nations navigate economic pressures and retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, an incident that also sent a passenger flying overboard. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, officials plan to move the carcass on Monday to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death. Authorities are urging boaters to exercise caution in the area and maintain a safe distance from the carcass.</p>

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or any Fed rate hikes this year, predicting slow but steady growth. He acknowledged that the ongoing tariff war and other uncertainties have slowed business activity, as companies wait for clarity on trade, tax, and immigration policies before making major investments. Moynihan also discussed the long-term impact of AI on the job market, suggesting it will significantly reshape work but that the economy has historically adapted to such technological shifts.

          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist David Marcus advocates for the Washington NFL team to restore its former "Redskins" name, a change he attributes to the "woke madness" of 2020. The author argues that this and other changes, such as the removal of historical statues, were part of a destructive and irrational hysteria that should be reversed. He contends that society must be able to correct its mistakes and reclaim its history, rather than accepting such cultural shifts as a permanent, one-way progression.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner following a weak jobs report that included downward revisions. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the data revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, stating the president wants his own, more reliable people in place. The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists, who fear the move undermines the credibility and independence of vital government data and appears to be a politically motivated act of shooting the messenger.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions broadly unlawful, deemed exceptionally large commissions unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007, with the first payouts expected next year.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment in Britain. This official scheme, which could be operational within weeks, follows criticism that the government had previously declined to support such an evacuation. The plan will allow children, accompanied by a guardian, to enter the UK for free medical care unavailable in the war-torn territory, where the UN reports over 50,000 children have been killed or injured.</p>
