          <p>President Donald Trump has approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, reversing an earlier block by President Biden due to national security concerns. Trump stated that the partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. U.S. Steel's headquarters will remain in Pittsburgh, with the majority of the investment occurring over the next 14 months. Trump also announced he would hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30, signaling his support for the deal and its economic impact.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to send approximately 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants within the U.S. interior.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Apple would face a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, primarily in China and India. Trump stated that he expected Apple to produce iPhones in the U.S., and this tariff would apply if they did not comply. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested this move aligns with the administration's goal of bringing "precision manufacturing" back to the U.S., particularly in semiconductors. This action is part of Trump's ongoing pressure on Apple to increase domestic manufacturing, despite the company's existing investments in U.S. development.</p>
