          <h2>Taiwanese Companies Halt Expansion and Cut Jobs in Anticipation of US Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by two Taiwanese think tanks reveals that potential US tariffs under the Trump administration are causing significant uncertainty for the island's businesses. Over a quarter of surveyed companies with US trade ties have suspended expansion plans, and five percent have begun laying off staff in response to the tariff threat. While a hypothetical 10% tariff was seen by many as having a minor impact, the possibility of broader and higher duties is prompting preemptive, defensive measures across Taiwan's corporate sector. This highlights the economic ripple effects of US trade policy on key international partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight pilot performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft while approaching Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the military plane appeared on a converging course unexpectedly, as the airport tower lacks radar and relies on visual confirmation. He apologized for the sudden turn, noting it was the safest course of action and an unusual event. The Air Force acknowledged a B-52 was conducting a flyover for the state fair and, along with the FAA, is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which houses asylum seekers, turned violent, resulting in six arrests. Demonstrators threw bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles, prompting a strong police response and condemnation of the "mindless thuggery." The unrest follows the recent arrest of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assault in the town. Downing Street has called the scenes unacceptable, while police implemented special dispersal and face-covering removal orders to manage the disorder and prevent further anti-social behavior from the more than 1,000 people gathered.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's social media platform, X, has refused to comply with a demand from French authorities to hand over data as part of a criminal investigation. The company claims the probe, which concerns alleged algorithmic manipulation and fraudulent data extraction, is politically motivated and an attempt to restrict free speech. X stated it has not been given specific allegations but raised concerns about the impartiality of the experts designated to analyze its algorithm. French prosecutors initiated the investigation in January following complaints of foreign interference on the platform.</p>

          <p>Greece has revealed the boundaries for two new marine parks in the Ionian and Aegean seas, which Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says will be the largest in the Mediterranean. The parks are intended to protect marine life and will help Greece meet its goal of designating 30% of its waters as protected areas ahead of schedule. However, the plan has drawn criticism from neighboring Turkey, which argues that Greece is exploiting environmental issues and that such unilateral actions should be avoided. Turkey stated the parks have no legal bearing on maritime disputes between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An American marketing professor from UC Berkeley, Przemyslaw Jeziorski, was shot and killed in Athens while on his way to pick up his children from his ex-wife's home. Greek police have arrested his ex-wife's new partner, who allegedly confessed to the murder, claiming he did it to prevent Jeziorski from taking the children away amid a custody dispute. The victim's ex-wife and three other men are also facing charges as accomplices. Leaked police confessions reveal conflicting accounts, setting the stage for a complex and high-profile trial while the victim's family seeks custody of the children.</p>

          <p>A 1906 shipwreck off the Belgian coast is being used as a novel habitat to reintroduce rare native flat oysters to the North Sea. The Belreefs project deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, aiming to create a biodiversity sanctuary where fishing is banned. Scientists explain that oyster reefs are crucial for marine ecosystems, as they purify water and provide breeding grounds for other species. The initiative seeks to restore oyster populations that were decimated by overfishing and disease, turning a piece of cultural heritage into a tool for ecological restoration.</p>

Despite a successful season that included a Masters win, McIlroy trails Scheffler significantly in the world rankings. The analysis highlights Scheffler's remarkable consistency in major championships, drawing parallels to McIlroy's own period of dominance a decade ago. While McIlroy remains the most likely challenger, the article notes the immense difficulty of overcoming Scheffler, who is described as the best at executing under pressure in the game today.</p>

          <p>Residents of two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are being evicted after the buildings were deemed unsafe by fire services, despite £1 million having been spent on attempted repairs. Owners in the former council blocks, sold as "luxury" flats, describe "years of hell" paying for works while the properties deteriorated. The situation is being blamed on a "broken leasehold system" and a history of management issues involving offshore-registered firms. Knowsley Council spent nearly £400,000 on safety patrols, but a prohibition notice now makes it illegal for residents to remain in their homes.</p>

These vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to bypass security, steal sensitive data, or remotely control devices like cameras and microphones.

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of Chief Justice John Roberts's role in shaping the modern American presidency, arguing his legal opinions have significantly expanded executive authority. The piece contends that Roberts, through key rulings on issues like immigration and presidential immunity, has advanced a "unitary executive" theory that concentrates power in the president. This judicial philosophy, the article suggests, has provided a constitutional framework for the Trump administration's broad exercise of power, transforming the presidency into a more authoritarian institution and departing from historical checks and balances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is being criticized for a systematic purge of federal climate change information, including the recent removal of the National Climate Assessments website. This move follows the dismissal of 400 experts working on the next report and the defunding of key climate modeling programs. Critics and science historians describe this as "denial by erasure," a strategy to undermine the scientific basis for climate policy by withholding data and suppressing research. This approach marks a shift from debating climate science to actively obscuring the information itself, making it harder to regulate emissions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly relied on tariffs as its preferred tool for foreign policy leverage, a departure from the traditional use of sanctions. This strategy, part of the "America First" agenda, allows for direct, unilateral action without congressional approval, fitting the administration's goal of rapid economic pressure. While criticized for creating market uncertainty and risking trade wars, tariffs generate revenue and can be adjusted more flexibly than sanctions. The administration has blurred the lines by using tariffs for non-trade issues, such as immigration and pressuring political allies. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Michael O'Leary stated that while over 99% of passengers comply, the incentive helps manage the "scourge" of excess baggage.

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of brands like Jeep, Fiat, and Vauxhall, announced that US tariffs have cost it €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff on imported cars, which has disrupted trade and forced the company to reduce planned production. The automaker's shipments to North America fell by 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, contributing to a projected net loss. This report highlights the significant financial strain that the Trump administration's tariff policies are placing on global car manufacturers with complex international supply chains.
