            <p>The Trump administration announced new fees on Chinese-built vessels docking at U.S. ports following a U.S. Trade Representative investigation that found China's shipbuilding policies unreasonable and restrictive to U.S. commerce. The fees, designed to counteract China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, will be charged per voyage, starting at $0 per net ton and escalating to $140 per net ton by 2028 for Chinese-owned vessels. China's commerce ministry has condemned the move, while the World Shipping Council expressed concerns about the potential harm to U.S. consumers and businesses. The policy includes remissions for vessel owners who order U.S.-built ships. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Power has been restored to nearly all customers in Puerto Rico after an island-wide blackout earlier this week, according to Luma Energy. The outage, affecting over 1.45 million customers, was triggered by a transmission line failure that caused generators to shut down. This is the latest in a series of major outages on the island, which has struggled with its power grid since Hurricane Maria in 2017. Authorities are investigating the cause of the failure, with preliminary analysis pointing to a protection system failure and vegetation on a transmission line.</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly considering plans to end most of its routine food safety inspections, potentially outsourcing this oversight to state and local authorities. The FDA denies this claim. The move could free up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections, as the agency already contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico for some routine inspections. Some higher-risk inspections, such as those at infant formula manufacturers, would likely remain under FDA oversight. The agency is facing budget constraints and a backlog of inspections.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has halted construction of the Empire Wind 1 project, a major offshore wind farm off the coast of Long Island. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum instructed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction pending further review. The project, which promised to create jobs and power 500,000 homes, is being challenged due to concerns about environmental impact. The decision has sparked criticism from labor unions and environmental advocates, who fear it will hinder New York's renewable energy goals.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is prepared to abandon efforts to broker a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine if there is no progress soon, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Donald Trump remains interested in a deal but is willing to move on if a settlement cannot be reached. Russia has launched a fresh military push and stepped up attacks on Ukrainian civilians, while the U.S. has stopped most military assistance to Kyiv. The latest U.S. peace plan would freeze the war along the existing frontline.</p>

            <p>Experts fear that the Trump administration's trade war with China could undermine the United States' global authority. The tariffs, including a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, may erode long-term geopolitical relationships and weaken the U.S.'s position. While Trump argues the tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs, economists warn they could disrupt world power balances and damage international cooperation. Some historians believe alliances will remain strong, while others worry about the fragmentation of the global order.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve and his implementation of sweeping global tariffs are raising concerns about economic stability. His tariffs, including a 145 percent tariff on all goods from China, are hurting farmers, small businesses, and consumers. Experts fear these policies could lead to a recession. Trump's potential firing of Fed Chair Jerome Powell could further destabilize the markets. The country faces higher borrowing costs and slower growth due to these policies.</p>

            <p>New tariffs, including those on vehicles and parts, threaten to push auto insurance rates even higher. Tariffs are increasing the prices of parts, making maintenance and repairs more expensive. This rise in repair costs will likely lead to higher insurance premiums. While insurance rates had started to stabilize after pandemic-related increases, the introduction of tariffs is creating new uncertainty. Experts recommend shopping around for the best insurance rates and driving cautiously to maintain low premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

Aaron Friar and his daughter, Ellie, disappeared from their home, prompting a search. Ellie was found safe, but her father was missing, and blood evidence suggested foul play. Detective Bill Ford interviewed Russell Jones, who initially wanted a cigarette before talking. Ford's tactic of "smokin' and jokin'" led Jones to confess to helping load Aaron's body and directing police to the location.</p>
