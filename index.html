          <p>Ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine in London have been downgraded, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff no longer participating. This comes amid speculation that Russia might be willing to halt its invasion along current front lines in return for US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected. Despite Putin's declaration of an Easter truce, UK intelligence found no evidence of a let-up in attacks. The conflict, ongoing since 2014, has resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of refugees.</p>

          <p>The UK government has promised to eliminate the driving test backlog by next summer, aiming to provide at least 10,000 extra tests monthly. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged current wait times are unacceptable, with some areas experiencing minimum six-month delays.

          <p>Elon Musk will reduce his role in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) after Tesla reported a significant drop in profits and sales. Musk's political involvement has faced criticism and boycotts, leading to concerns about his focus on Tesla. Despite reducing his time commitment to Doge, Musk intends to remain involved in the Trump administration as long as he is useful to the president. Tesla's financial struggles are partly attributed to tariffs on Chinese parts and changing political sentiment.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a significant jump after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake of over 5% in the company. Elliott's involvement is expected to pressure BP to shift away from its green strategy and focus more on its core oil and gas businesses. BP had previously scaled back its emissions targets, citing the need to continue investing in fossil fuels to meet global demand. The company's CEO and outgoing Chair faced reduced support during a recent board re-election vote.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed more than expected last year, adding pressure to public finances amid the looming impact of US tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is in Washington to push for a trade deal with the US to avoid import taxes on UK exports. Higher borrowing has increased expectations of potential spending cuts or tax increases to adhere to borrowing rules. The IMF forecasts lower UK growth for 2025, partly due to US tariffs, rising inflation, and borrowing costs.</p>
