          <p>A drive-by shooting outside a River North nightclub in Chicago resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred as patrons were leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police are searching for three shooters who fired from a dark SUV into the crowd. This location has a history of violence, as a mass shooting also took place there in November 2022 when it was under different management. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives has advanced President Trump's signature legislative package after a prolonged overnight session to secure votes from Republican holdouts. The bill, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense while cutting health and nutrition programs, faced resistance due to changes made in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson and the White House were heavily involved in persuading skeptical members to approve the procedural vote. A final passage vote is expected soon, following a lengthy debate on the House floor.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated unexpected strength by adding 147,000 nonfarm payrolls in June, exceeding economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. Wage growth remained moderate, with average hourly earnings increasing by 3.7% year-over-year. The robust report has led markets to significantly reduce the probability of a July interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a busy July 4th holiday, the U.S. airline industry is bracing for a challenging second half of the year due to an oversupply of flights and weakening demand. Several major carriers, including Southwest and Delta, have pulled their 2025 forecasts amid economic uncertainty and have started to cut unprofitable routes. While millions are traveling, average domestic airfares are down 3% from last year, indicating a softer market.

          <p>A report by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services has found that investigations into historical child sexual exploitation in Manchester were significantly delayed by heavily redacted evidence from the city council. Some documents provided to Greater Manchester Police were nearly impossible to assess, hindering probes into cases like Operation Green Jacket. While the police force has since made significant improvements in its handling of such cases, the report notes that past failings led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" among victims. New information-sharing protocols have now been established to prevent future delays.</p>

          <p>After a period of strong sales boosted by significant discounts, Apple is expected to face challenges in the Chinese market during the second half of 2025. Analysts from Counterpoint Research predict that demand for the iPhone will weaken due to sluggish consumer spending and the aging iPhone 16 product cycle. Furthermore, aggressive competition from domestic rivals, particularly Huawei's high-end smartphones, is anticipated to put additional pressure on Apple's market share.

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals shocking details in the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in 2020. The indictment alleges her remains, found in a shallow grave, were moved there after decomposing elsewhere. Toxicologists also found a tranquilizer compound used for wildlife in her bone marrow, a substance Barry Morphew had access to and admitted using on deer. This suggests her death was not immediate, and she was likely drugged before being killed. Barry Morphew was re-arrested and charged with first-degree murder after initial charges were dismissed.</p>

The drills, which extended near Guam, involved the carriers training against each other in various combat scenarios, including counterstrikes and air defense. According to military analysts, this head-to-head training provides a level of experience that even the U.S. military rarely gains, as it pushes the boundaries of their naval capabilities.

          <p>California has enacted two significant housing bills aimed at boosting construction by reforming the state's environmental review process. The new laws exempt most urban, multifamily housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often used to delay or block development through litigation. This move, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is seen as a major victory for the "Yes in My Backyard" (YIMBY) movement and a philosophical shift for Democrats toward prioritizing housing abundance. The reforms passed despite opposition from some environmental and labor groups, signaling a new focus on tackling the state's severe housing crisis.</p>

The satellite, backed by Google and Jeff Bezos, lost communication ten days ago and is considered "likely not recoverable" by the Environmental Defense Fund, the NGO that oversaw the project. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and the satellite was designed to provide publicly available data to identify major polluters from the oil, gas, and agriculture sectors.

          <p>Ken Casey, frontman of the band Dropkick Murphys, is using his platform to challenge what he sees as the co-opting of working-class identity by the MAGA movement. In an article for The Atlantic, he recounts a recent concert where he engaged with a Trump supporter, wagering that the fan's MAGA merchandise was not American-made, which it wasn't. Casey expresses frustration that his band's pro-worker, anti-bully stance is now viewed by some as "elite" or partisan. He argues for pushing back against political division and believes more artists should speak out during this critical political moment.</p>

          <p>Approximately 120,000 car owners in the UK have been instructed to stop driving their Citroen C3 and DS3 models due to a potentially fatal airbag fault. The "stop-drive" recall from parent company Stellantis affects vehicles built between 2009 and 2019 that are equipped with airbags from the now-defunct supplier Takata. The chemical propellant in these airbags can degrade over time and cause the inflator to rupture violently in a crash. Owners have reported long waits for repairs, leaving many stranded without transportation for essential needs while the company works to source replacement parts.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox explores the growing parental desire for kids to have a "lazy summer" with less structured time, reminiscent of the 1990s, versus the current reality dominated by screens and parental work schedules. While the idea of fostering independence and saving on camp costs is appealing, the ubiquity of smartphones and platforms like YouTube Shorts has fundamentally changed unstructured downtime. Experts note that while kids have less free time and are more supervised than in the past, some digital activities like gaming can still offer benefits. The piece suggests that a completely screen-free, unsupervised summer is largely unrealistic for most modern families.</p>

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have announced a trade deal that will see the U.S. apply a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a rate significantly lower than the 46% previously imposed by President Trump.
