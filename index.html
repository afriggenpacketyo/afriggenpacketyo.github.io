          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people to a birthday party struck a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park in the Hudson River. The New York City Fire Department reported that 35 people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and 22 were hospitalized for treatment. The Coast Guard is currently investigating the incident, which resulted in some damage to the yacht. This event follows a similar incident last month where a Mexican navy training ship collided with the Brooklyn Bridge. The authorities are still looking into the causes of both crashes, but there are no reports of the yacht causing the death of any human being. The tone of the article is neutral and informative. Optimism that no lives were lost is present.</p>

          <p>Pop-punk band South Arcade discusses the inspiration behind their hit song, Supermodels, and the broader resurgence of Y2K culture. The band, whose members were born at the start of the millennium, draws inspiration from various 90s and early 2000s influences. They've gained traction via TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been widely used, and have found that their rehearsal footage resonates with audiences. The band members note that there is an element of escapism with Y2K core, as people's rooms were their personality and that is captured in their music.</p>

          <p>To promote Michael Jackson's album HIStory, ten giant statues of the pop star were erected around the world in 1995, later accompanying him on his global tour. Thirty years later, some of these statues still exist in unexpected places. One statue stood at a McDonald's in the Netherlands for decades until it was removed in 2019 due to the Leaving Neverland documentary, while another resides in a defunct nightclub in Austria. A third statue can be found at a Swiss fairground, and another repainted statue is located in an abandoned theme park in Johannesburg. The article explores the varying fates of these iconic monuments and their connection to Jackson's enduring legacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights for American citizens from Israel, according to U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. The initial flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens, carrying approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their families, and lawful permanent residents. The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, urging Americans not to travel there due to ongoing conflict and unrest. This decision follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for evacuations, with various other evacuation efforts being organized by private entities and state governments.</p>
