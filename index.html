          <p>This article explores the concept of "negativity bias," an evolutionary trait that hardwires humans to focus on threats and bad news. This psychological quirk, combined with the media's watchdog role, often overshadows stories of genuine progress, such as falling murder rates or decreased deaths from extreme weather. The author argues for "realistic optimism," suggesting that acknowledging positive developments is crucial for fostering resilience and inspiring action to solve global problems. It promotes a more balanced perspective to counteract the tendency to doomscroll.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a protest in Parliament Square, primarily for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The demonstration, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of activists display signs reading "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to the largest number of single-day arrests by the force in a decade. The mass arrests have sparked debate, with the Home Secretary defending the ban while groups like Amnesty International call the police response disproportionate.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have protested against the government's plan to broaden its military offensive. Demonstrators fear the expansion endangers the lives of both hostages and soldiers, and they are urging leaders to prioritize a deal for the hostages' release. The plan has also faced opposition from top military officials and international allies, with polls suggesting most Israelis favor a negotiated end to the war.

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite fragment that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.5 billion years old, predating our planet. The object, a type of stony meteorite known as a chondrite, created a loud boom and was seen as a fireball across the state in June. Researchers are studying the fragments to better understand the composition of asteroids and the potential threat they pose.

          <p>A resident of Novoaidar in the occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine describes a life of immense difficulty, with a shrinking population, damaged infrastructure, and severe economic strain. Many struggle to survive on meager incomes as food prices have soared, and access to essential services like healthcare and internet is severely limited. The occupying authorities are pressuring residents to accept Russian citizenship to receive benefits, which also makes them eligible for military conscription. Despite the hardships and a decree for non-citizens to leave, many, like the woman interviewed, intend to stay.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of Alexandra Pennig, a 32-year-old Minnesota nurse initially thought to be a suicide, took a sharp turn due to a key piece of evidence. Her colleague, Matthew Ecker, claimed she shot herself after locking herself in the bathroom. However, detectives discovered a small metal piece from the door's lock underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot. This finding contradicted Ecker's story, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

Democrats are campaigning against the legislation, highlighting cuts to social safety nets and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which they argue will make healthcare unaffordable for millions.

This move, framed as a matter of national security to counter a joint Chinese-Russian lunar base plan, signals a renewed focus on the Artemis moon program. A lunar base would require significant energy to sustain life, and a nuclear reactor is seen as a more viable long-term solution than solar power.

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of wanting to support animal welfare while finding a strict vegetarian or vegan diet difficult to maintain, especially due to health issues. It suggests a pragmatic, "reducetarian" approach, which focuses on meaningfully reducing harm rather than complete elimination. Practical options include choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, eating larger animals like cows instead of many chickens, and being mindful of misleading welfare labels. The goal is to balance personal well-being with a serious commitment to reducing animal suffering without adhering to an all-or-nothing mindset.</p>

Tarpley advocates for a more compassionate approach, where setbacks are normalized and accepted, allowing individuals to live a full life while still managing their condition.

Recent actions include demanding the prosecution of his predecessor, firing a government statistician over a poor jobs report, and using federal power to influence state-level politics and cultural institutions. While the term "fascist" was once dismissed, a growing consensus believes the administration is systematically undermining the constitution, with some observers noting the speed and scale now exceed that of other autocrats like Hungary's Viktor Orbán.</p>

The concept, pioneered in China, is gaining traction in places like Los Angeles, where programs are underway to create more permeable surfaces and green spaces. However, L.A. faces challenges with high costs, bureaucratic hurdles, and slower progress compared to more centralized systems.</p>

          <p>Facing reduced reliability from traditional water sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California is planning major investments to prevent future water shortages. Water agencies are pursuing a diversified strategy that includes a massive wastewater recycling facility in Carson, capturing more stormwater, and potentially desalination. The goal is to create a sustainable and affordable water supply for 19 million people, learning from cities like Cape Town, South Africa, which narrowly averted its own "Day Zero" crisis. These costly projects aim to build resilience against longer droughts and more extreme weather patterns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of federal data shows that despite being a major focus of immigration protests, California had fewer ICE arrests in early 2025 than Texas or Florida. When adjusted for population, California ranked 27th, largely due to its "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents. In contrast, states like Texas have a long history of collaboration, leading to a higher percentage of arrests through jails and prisons. However, California did see a dramatic 212% spike in arrests, indicating a more aggressive, street-level enforcement strategy from ICE in the state.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to convene an emergency session to address Israel's plan to expand its military operation and take control of Gaza City. The proposal, approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, has drawn widespread global condemnation, with several European nations and the UN chief calling it a dangerous escalation. The move has also sparked anger within Israel, with families of hostages calling for a national strike in opposition. This international diplomatic response comes as Israel's far-right ministers push for an even more aggressive military approach in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun dismissing asylum applications from immigrants who entered the U.S. between 2019 and 2022, citing their failure to receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border. Due to a shortage of asylum officers during that period, many were released into the country before this screening could occur. Now, these individuals are being told their cases are closed and they must report to ICE to restart the process, a move lawyers fear will lead to their detention and deportation under new, stricter policies. This action effectively renders documented, tax-paying individuals undocumented again.</p>

He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can autonomously perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment. While he believes robot hardware is sufficiently advanced, Wang stated that the "AI for embodied intelligence" is the critical missing piece. He expressed doubts about current models but suggested that new approaches, like generating interactive video models for robots to follow, hold greater promise.</p>
