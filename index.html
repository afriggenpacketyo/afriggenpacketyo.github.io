          <p>President Donald Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, has taken effect. The ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Heightened restrictions are also imposed on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and lack valid visas. Trump stated the ban is a national security imperative to keep out radical Islamic terrorists after a terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. The order does not cancel existing visas. Optimism surrounding the global situation and the political climate is low.</p>

          <p>Tottenham is reportedly considering appointing Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach after Ange Postecoglou's departure. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, though no dialogue has been confirmed yet. Frank, who has been with Brentford since 2018, led the team into the Premier League and established them as a top-flight club with a small budget. Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, potentially exceeding Â£10m, depending on his staff choices. The team finished tenth in the Premier League this season, a significant improvement over Tottenham's performance. The move could bring a fresh perspective to Tottenham's coaching strategy.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Tennessee was contained after officers used gas to return prisoners to their cells. The incident began when several inmates refused to return to their cells, prompting a multi-agency response. Three guards were reportedly held hostage but were safely released without major injuries. The prisoners were contained within the facility fences, preventing any escape attempts, and authorities used gas to force them back into the cell block. The situation is now under control with no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for investing heavily in Bitcoin and traveling full-time, has overhauled their security measures following a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives. They have moved away from hardware wallets, opting for a hybrid system involving analog and digital methods. Seed phrases are now encrypted, split, and stored using blockchain-based services or hidden across four continents. This shift aims to decentralize not just their finances but also their personal risk profile, making it difficult for attackers to access their crypto holdings even under duress.

The new dip, costing an extra 75 cents, is the company's first new dip since queso blanco in 2020. Chipotle reported its first same-store sales decline since 2020 in the first quarter, citing consumer concerns about the economy. The company has lowered its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth, and shares have fallen 12% this year.

          <p>UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has cautioned against unregulated mining in the deep sea, emphasizing that oceans cannot become a "wild west." French President Emmanuel Macron echoed this sentiment, stating that oceans are not for sale. The remarks refer to President Trump's decision to issue permits for extracting critical minerals in international waters. Marine scientists are concerned about the potential harm to marine ecosystems. The issue is on the agenda at the UN Oceans Conference in Nice, France, along with over-fishing, plastic pollution, and climate change. The international community is grappling with balancing resource extraction and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is implementing a strategy to combat rising temperatures by planting more trees, particularly in urban heat island neighborhoods. The city and county are increasing efforts to provide shade and cooling, especially in lower-income areas disproportionately affected by heat. Research indicates that trees can lower temperatures by at least 10 degrees, offering relief during record-high temperatures. The initiative aims to address "shade disparity" and improve the long-term viability of communities by maximizing both trees and water resources. The effort includes teaching the next generation about environmental consciousness through school garden clubs.</p>

          <p>A prominent Sikh house of worship in the U.S. is urging the Department of Justice to investigate the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), alleging it operates as a "foreign agent" on behalf of the Indian government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Fremont Gurdwara Sahib claims the HAF has facilitated meetings between foreign principals and U.S. lawmakers and advocated for the interests of the BJP. The HAF denies these claims, asserting its independence and lack of affiliation with any political parties. These allegations arise amid heightened tensions between Sikhs supporting an independent state and the Indian government, with accusations of transnational repression against Sikhs outside of India. The investigation could reveal details of the HAF's activities and financial arrangements.</p>

It also proposes eliminating subsidized loans and imposing lifetime borrowing caps, which could disproportionately affect students from low- and middle-income families. Critics argue that these changes would shift the burden to private lenders with higher interest rates, making college more expensive.
