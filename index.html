          <p>A consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's MGX is set to become the primary investors in TikTok's U.S. business, controlling approximately 45% of the new entity. The deal, which President Trump is expected to approve, aims to address national security concerns by restructuring the social media app's ownership and operations in the United States. Under the new structure, TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a 19.9% stake, with a majority-American board of directors overseeing the venture and Oracle managing data security.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for the family of a 32-year-old man who died after riding a roller coaster at Universal's Epic Universe theme park state that his death was caused by blunt force trauma from the ride, not his pre-existing spinal disability. They allege he hit his head on a restraint multiple times, a claim supported by the medical examiner's ruling of accidental death from multiple blunt impact injuries. The family's lawyers are challenging Universal's initial statement that the ride functioned properly, arguing that a lack of malfunction does not equate to a lack of safety issues.</p>

His comments come as the deadline for a funding deal approaches and the Trump administration warns federal agencies to prepare for potential mass firings. Jeffries stated that Democrats will not be intimidated by these threats, framing the looming shutdown as a direct consequence of Republican political strategy rather than a failure of bipartisan negotiation to reach a stopgap agreement.</p>

          <p>In the New Jersey gubernatorial race, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli accuses his Democratic rival, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, of excessively blaming President Trump for state-level problems. Ciattarelli argues that pressing local issues like property taxes, public safety, and rising energy costs are unrelated to the president's agenda. The race is seen as a key barometer for national political sentiment, with Sherrill's campaign frequently linking Ciattarelli to Trump, while Ciattarelli attempts to focus the debate on what he describes as failures of long-term Democratic governance in the state.</p>

          <p>Career federal prosecutors in Virginia have concluded their investigation into former FBI Director James Comey, finding insufficient evidence to support criminal charges for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this, sources indicate that the newly appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, intends to seek an indictment from a grand jury, aligning with President Trump's public calls to prosecute his political adversaries. This move is reportedly against the advice of veteran prosecutors, who believe it violates DOJ policy and falls short of the probable cause standard.</p>

          <p>After 85 years, the Social Security Administration is ending the practice of mailing paper checks, transitioning nearly all recipients to electronic payments starting September 30. Beneficiaries will now receive their funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the SSA says will improve efficiency, enhance security, and save costs. While the shift is mandatory for most of the nearly 70 million recipients, the agency has stated that exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means of receiving their payments.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, President Donald Trump urged Turkey to cease purchasing oil from Russia to help cut off Moscow's energy funding amid the war in Ukraine. The meeting also addressed Turkey's long-standing desire to purchase F-35 fighter jets, from which it was expelled after acquiring a Russian air defense system. While Trump expressed optimism that a deal on the jets and the lifting of sanctions could be reached, no firm commitments were made during their discussion.</p>

          <p>Disney+ is the latest streaming service to announce a price increase, joining a trend that has seen companies like Netflix, Apple TV+, and Peacock also raise their rates this year. The continuous price hikes are frustrating consumers who initially embraced streaming as a cheaper alternative to cable, only to find the costs accumulating again. This has created a dynamic where media companies, facing high content production costs, are testing consumers' willingness to pay, while viewers are becoming more strategic, subscribing seasonally to watch specific content before cancelling.</p>

          <p>Country singer Margo Price's recent appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" occurred during an episode that led to the show's temporary removal from ABC's schedule. The suspension was due to controversial comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the alleged shooter of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Price, whose new album includes an anti-fascist protest song she performed on the show, was inadvertently pulled into the national debate over free speech and media responsibility that erupted following Kimmel's remarks and the network's subsequent action.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his argument that the U.S. should regain control of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, citing its strategic proximity to China's nuclear weapons development and testing sites. Since the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, Trump has framed the abandonment of the base as a mistake and recently suggested a deal could be negotiated with the Taliban to get it back. However, the Taliban has publicly rejected any plan to hand over the base, referencing the 2020 Doha agreement in which the U.S. pledged to respect Afghanistan's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has begun a "phased restart" of its IT systems, which were shut down following a major cyberattack in August that halted all vehicle production. The company is now able to process payments to its suppliers, who have been under severe financial strain due to the prolonged shutdown of JLR's factories. While the global parts logistics center is returning to full operation, the main production lines will remain closed until at least next month, and the UK government is exploring a support package for the affected supply chain businesses.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires has identified significant weaknesses, including understaffing, outdated emergency alert policies, and poor communication systems. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, found these issues led to delays in warning residents to evacuate. Critical staffing shortages in the sheriff's department and unreliable cellular connectivity for first responders were cited as major factors that hampered the effectiveness of the overall emergency response.</p>

          <p>With a federal government shutdown just days away, congressional Democrats are holding firm on their demand that any short-term funding bill must include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. These subsidies, which help millions of Americans afford health insurance, are set to expire, and Democrats are leveraging the funding deadline to force Republicans to address the issue. The Republican leadership has so far rejected this demand, insisting on a "clean" funding bill without policy additions, creating a high-stakes standoff with significant consequences.</p>

Zelenskyy clarified, however, that these potential strikes would be aimed at military and government sites, insisting that Ukraine would not target civilians.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether long-term care insurance is a worthwhile investment, especially as the costs of nursing homes, assisted living, and in-home aides continue to rise faster than inflation. It highlights that Medicare does not cover most long-term custodial care, leaving many retirees to deplete their savings to pay for these services. The piece advises that securing a policy is easier and cheaper when an individual is younger and healthier, suggesting that waiting until care is needed could make it prohibitively expensive.
