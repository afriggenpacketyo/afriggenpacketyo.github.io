        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has confirmed its first-ever use of generative artificial intelligence for on-screen visual effects in its Argentine sci-fi series, "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated the technology enabled the creation of a complex building collapse sequence that would have been financially unfeasible for the show's budget, emphasizing AI's potential to enhance creative possibilities. This development is significant as the use of AI in entertainment remains a contentious issue, having been a central concern during the 2023 Hollywood strikes over fears of human job displacement.</p>

          <p>The space technology sector is experiencing a surge in investment, attracting $3.1 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a significant increase from the previous period. This growth is driven by sustained interest in defense applications and improved market sentiment, with U.S. firms capturing the majority of the funding. The report highlights the strong performance of newly public companies and an anticipated rise in high-value acquisition deals. Venture capital remains the most active investor class, with notable momentum in funding for space habitats and on-orbit servicing technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A temporary ban on using hosepipes and sprinklers has been enacted for over 1.4 million people in Kent and Sussex by South East Water. The restriction follows a period of extended dry, warm weather that has pushed demand for drinking water to record levels, with the utility reporting its highest-ever usage day on June 30. This measure, which prohibits non-essential water use like gardening and car washing, is a response to England's second-driest spring on record, with other water companies in the UK implementing or planning similar bans to manage resources.</p>

          <p>India's recent ban on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has reignited debate over the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) accused the firm of a "deliberate strategy to manipulate indices" by using large stock and futures trades to artificially move prices for the benefit of its options positions. Financial experts explain the crucial difference lies in intent, noting that while arbitrage exploits existing price inefficiencies, manipulation involves actively creating those inefficiencies to profit, underscoring global regulatory challenges.

This charge is in addition to existing visa application fees and will be collected upon visa issuance, starting from the 2025 fiscal year.

The fire beetle's unique biological organ can detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, a natural mechanism that evolved to help it find ideal, post-fire locations for reproduction.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism following a security incident at Vancouver's airport. Authorities allege he seized control of a small Cessna aircraft by threatening a flight instructor and flew it to Vancouver, prompting the scrambling of NORAD fighter jets before a safe landing. Investigators believe the act was driven by an ideological motive, with social media posts under the same name indicating a belief that he was a "messenger of Allah" sent to save humanity from climate change.</p>

          <p>A man shares his personal story of a years-long struggle with a persistent genital itch that was repeatedly misdiagnosed as a fungal infection or eczema. After more than a year of ineffective treatments, his question, "Would a biopsy help?" led to a diagnosis of invasive Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a very rare form of skin cancer. The article details his difficult journey through multiple surgeries and the healthcare system, highlighting the critical importance of self-advocacy in medicine. He has since created a major online support group to raise awareness for the rare disease.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a moderation in rice price inflation, which had been surging for months due to poor harvests, though inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, persistent yen depreciation and the potential for higher U.S. tariffs could reintroduce inflationary pressures, creating uncertainty for the economic outlook.

          <p>An analysis piece questions the official reasoning behind CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," suggesting it may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump. While the network cited financial reasons, the article notes Colbert's show leads in ratings and contrasts the decision with recent actions by parent company Paramount, such as settling a lawsuit with Trump and the departure of a top '60 Minutes' executive. The article posits that sacrificing the prominent Trump critic's show could be a strategic move to ensure federal approval for Paramount's pending merger with Skydance.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged an error on his program regarding a report that accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of lying about a phone call with President Trump. The acknowledgment comes after Newsom filed a $787-million defamation lawsuit against Watters and the network. Watters claimed he misunderstood a social media post by Newsom and stated the governor "wasn't lying. He was just confusing and unclear." In response to Watters' on-air remarks, a spokesperson for Newsom indicated the lawsuit will proceed.</p>

          <p>Veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party pending an investigation into comments she made about racism. In a recent BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views from 2023, suggesting that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudices faced by Jewish people or Travellers because skin color is immediately visible. Following her suspension, Abbott stated that it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out" and that her comments were factually correct, further deepening the rift within the party over issues of antisemitism and discipline.</p>

          <p>The political controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein has intensified, with President Trump threatening to sue The Wall Street Journal over a report claiming he sent a lewd birthday card to the financier in 2003. Trump has denied the claim as "fake" and simultaneously directed his attorney general to seek the court's approval to unseal grand jury testimony from the case. This dual-pronged response reflects the growing pressure on the administration from both political opponents and its own base, who are demanding more transparency about the disgraced financier's case.</p>

          <p>Cristosal, one of El Salvador's most prominent human rights organizations, has announced it is suspending its operations within the country and moving into exile due to escalating threats from President Nayib Bukele's government. The group, which has documented abuses for 25 years, cited legal harassment, espionage, and defamation campaigns that made it unsafe for them to continue their work. This departure is part of a larger exodus of journalists and activists from El Salvador amid Bukele's widespread crackdown on crime, which critics say has led to mass incarcerations and severe human rights violations.</p>

The incident reportedly occurred during a Supreme National Security Council meeting, where he suffered leg injuries while using an emergency exit. President Pezeshkian had previously claimed in an interview that Israel had attempted to assassinate him by targeting the meeting location, an assertion now seemingly corroborated by this intelligence.

          <p>House Republicans' plan to pass a $9 billion spending cuts package has been complicated by internal party tensions and Democratic pressure regarding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The vote on the bill, which targets foreign aid and public broadcasting, faced delays as Democrats used procedural maneuvers to force votes on making the Epstein documents public. This has placed some Republicans in a difficult political position, caught between President Trump's dismissal of the issue as a hoax and a segment of their base demanding full transparency.</p>
