          <p>Amazon initially considered displaying import charges on its ultra-discount Haul products in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, but later scrapped the idea. This consideration was separate from Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China. The White House reacted strongly, calling the potential move a 'hostile and political act'. Amazon clarified that the plan was never approved and would not be implemented, leading Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to commend the decision. Amazon has been assessing the impact of Trump's tariffs on third-party sellers, some of whom have already raised prices or cut advertising. </p>

          <p>Consumer confidence declined sharply in April, reaching its lowest point since 2011, driven by concerns over tariffs and employment prospects. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 86, below expectations, with the expectations index signaling potential recessionary conditions. Pessimism about business conditions, employment, and future income contributed to the decline, with respondents expecting job losses at levels nearing the Great Recession. Inflation expectations also rose, and fears over tariffs reached a survey high. In related news, job postings fell to their lowest level since September 2024.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are using procedural tactics to block a Democratic effort to investigate Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's use of Signal for communications. The GOP included language in a rule accompanying unrelated measures to prevent Democrats from calling up a resolution of inquiry demanding Trump release Hegseth's Signal communications. This move effectively stalls the resolution until after September 30. Speaker Johnson defended the action as preventing 'political hijinks' and a waste of time, noting he has used this maneuver before to block tariff-related measures.</p>

          <p>The Canadian Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, secured a surprising victory after trailing significantly in polls, partly attributed to Donald Trump's threats against Canada. The Liberals effectively capitalized on Trump's rhetoric by contrasting it with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's policies. Beyond Trump's influence, the Liberals' success stems from their progressive policies and strategic leadership changes, including replacing Justin Trudeau with Mark Carney and repealing the unpopular carbon tax. This victory marks the fourth consecutive election win for the Liberals, highlighting their political prowess and ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are calling for a White House disclosure of financial transactions leading up to President Trump's tariff pause, raising concerns about potential insider trading. Senators Schiff and Levin, along with 23 other Democrats, requested that senior White House employees report their securities transactions since Trump took office and make the reports public. The request follows Trump's rollback of tariffs, which caused the stock market to surge, and concerns that individuals close to the President may have violated federal ethics laws.

While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles will remain, the new measures will prevent additional tariffs on steel and aluminum from 'stacking' on top. Tariffs on auto parts are still scheduled to take effect, but reimbursements will be available, initially covering 3.75% of a U.S.-made car's value, decreasing to 2.5% in the second year before being phased out.

          <p>Robert Reich argues that the unifying theme of Donald Trump's presidency is ineptitude, citing examples such as the Pete Hegseth disaster, the Harvard debacle, and the tariff travesty. Reich suggests that Trump's erratic policies, attacks on the Federal Reserve, and immigration blunders demonstrate his inability to govern effectively. He criticizes the chaos within the administration, including the firing of federal workers and the appointment of unqualified individuals. Reich concludes that Trump's incompetence threatens American safety, security, and the rule of law, urging a focus on his inability to govern.</p>

          <p>Daniel Dubois' trainer accused Oleksandr Usyk of 'conning the boxing world' during a pre-fight meeting in London. The accusation stems from their previous fight in August 2023, where Usyk won via stoppage but was dropped by a body shot that was ruled a low blow. At a news conference, Usyk presented Dubois with images suggesting the punch was legal, leading to a heated exchange. The two fighters will have a rematch for all four world titles at Wembley Stadium on July 19.</p>

          <p>Renée Richards, a transgender sports pioneer, discusses the restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days. While Richards believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports, she is concerned about broader restrictions on transgender rights, particularly the military ban. She sees a connection between the debate over transgender athletes and the expansion of restrictions to the military, education, and other areas. Richards believes Trump's advisors are telling him that his popularity rests with those who oppose transgender rights.</p>
