            <p>Hutchmed (China) is adjusting its supply chain for the blood-cancer drug tazemetostat, recently approved in China, to counter the impact of the US-China trade war. The drug, currently manufactured in the US, faces potential tariffs upon import into China. The company is exploring options to minimize costs, including conducting separate trials in China to potentially expand the drug's usage to patients with solid cancers. Hutchmed aims to conduct similar studies on tazemetostat among Chinese patients with solid tumors, potentially expanding its usage beyond follicular lymphoma.</p>

            <p>A Fox News opinion piece argues that some on the right are adopting leftist approaches by supporting tariffs, potentially harming small businesses with overseas supply chains. The author contends that these businesses contribute to the American economy by creating jobs in design, marketing, and sales within the US, while also exploiting comparative advantages in the supply chain. The article warns against central planning and advocates for incentives to help Main Street thrive, rather than anti-freedom barriers. The author suggests that moving away from freedom and capitalism is the root cause of many economic issues and moving further in that direction leaves us without principles and will likely make matters worse.</p>

            <p>As tariffs impact supply chains, consumers may increasingly look for the 'Made in USA' label, which signifies that all or virtually all of a product originates in the United States. However, complex trade rules and manufacturing networks complicate the determination of a product's country of origin. The FTC requires that the final assembly or processing and a significant portion of manufacturing costs occur domestically for a product to qualify. Bilateral trade agreements and exceptions for 'substantial transformation' further influence what can be labeled 'Made in USA'.</p>

Critics argue that this is an attempt to use the courts for partisan gain and erode faith in the electoral system.

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump in March, driven by businesses frontloading shipments to avoid anticipated U.S. tariffs. Exports rose by 12.4%, while imports declined by 4.3%. The increase in exports is attributed to businesses trying to get ahead of the prohibitive U.S. tariffs. The Chinese leadership has set an ambitious annual growth target of around 5% for the year, which may be harder to achieve given trade war prospects and lackluster domestic consumption.

The analyst believes these companies should be a cornerstone of ESG funds. This suggestion is met with skepticism from others in the ESG investment space. (not investment advice)</p>
