A U.S. District Judge granted Khalil's release on bail, a decision criticized by the Trump administration, which argues that an immigration judge should have the authority to decide on his release. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March and has maintained he is being punished for his protected speech.

A U.S. District Judge ordered his release, stating the government failed to prove he was a flight risk or a danger to the public. The Trump administration, which has accused Khalil of playing a role in antisemitic protests, is still attempting to deport him based on allegations of misrepresentation on his green card application.

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron" for not lowering interest rates more aggressively and suggesting he might fire him. It is legally contentious whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends in 2026, as federal law states members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors can only be fired "for cause." Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth, while the Fed remains cautious about inflation risks. Powell has stated he will not resign if asked.

          <p>A federal judge declined to order Trump administration officials to recover deleted messages from the encrypted messaging service Signal, but issued a preliminary injunction requiring them to notify the acting archivist of any messages at risk of deletion. The lawsuit, brought by American Oversight, alleges that officials violated federal records law by discussing official government actions on Signal. The judge's ruling comes after reports that top national security officials shared information about targets, weapons, and attack sequencing just ahead of airstrikes in Yemen.

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is primarily focused on accommodating President Trump's demands for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte aims to avoid conflict with the U.S. by committing to higher defense spending, though compromise and disagreements on trade, Russia, and the Middle East are expected. The summit's brevity and reduced agenda are seen as efforts to cater to Trump's preferences and hide divisions.

It mocks the idea that ICE agents have no uniform and encourages them to express themselves through their clothing, as long as it doesn't identify them as officers of the law. The article emphasizes that the goal is to avoid giving the impression that the agent is accountable to anyone.
