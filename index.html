        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data indicates a significant drop in U.S. demand for e-commerce giants Shein and Temu following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' trade loophole. Temu's daily active users in the U.S. decreased by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein saw a 25% reduction, coinciding with a pullback in U.S. advertising spend by both companies. The decline is also reflected in the platforms' Apple App Store rankings, and neither company has yet responded to requests for comment. These shifts suggest a potential impact of trade policies on consumer behavior and the competitive landscape for these companies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new travel ban, restricting entry to the U.S. for nationals of 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran, citing national security concerns. The proclamation identifies these countries as having inadequate vetting processes to detect potential security threats. The ban also includes partial restrictions for seven additional countries, and provides exemptions for certain travelers, such as athletes and U.S. permanent residents. Democrats have criticized the move, while some affected countries have expressed a willingness to address security issues and others have condemned the policy.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry has warned that the export controls could soon halt production, urging German and EU lawmakers to address the issue with China.

          <p>The Trump administration's deployment of military resources to the U.S.-Mexico border, including Stryker combat vehicles, is raising legal and ethical questions. Critics argue that this militarization blurs the line between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement, potentially violating the Posse Comitatus Act. The administration defends the expanded military presence as necessary for national security, citing concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The declining number of border crossings, however, has led to questions about the effectiveness and justification for such a large-scale military deployment. The increased military presence is seen as a divisive tactic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A charity is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-significant medical expenses. Many of these dogs face chronic health issues and injuries sustained during their service, and owners can incur substantial vet bills. Advocates argue that providing financial support would encourage more people to adopt retired police dogs, preventing potential euthanasia due to high costs. Stories of dogs like Marco and Audi, who served bravely and sustained injuries in the line of duty, highlight the need for better support. The lack of a pension system is viewed as a failure to properly honor their service.</p>

It also emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.

          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to construct the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project" aims to provide a faster alternative for Chile's connectivity and is expected to benefit other South American countries. The cable will span 14,800 kilometers from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, with Google investing between $300 million and $550 million. The project is expected to improve telemedicine capabilities and reduce signal latency, enhancing digital infrastructure. This collaboration signals a significant step in global connectivity.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. However, the Italian government, led by Giorgia Meloni, opposes the measure and is encouraging citizens to abstain from voting. The government's stance reflects a broader trend of tightening citizenship rules and prioritizing traditional Italian identity. Supporters of the referendum argue that it would recognize the dignity and diversity of millions of residents and enrich the national story. The outcome of the referendum will significantly impact the lives of many immigrants in Italy.</p>

The administration’s investigation will focus on “who ran the United States while President Biden was in office”, according to the memo.
