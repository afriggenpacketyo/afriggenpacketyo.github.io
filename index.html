          <p>Elizabeth Tamilore Odunsi, a British nursing student, was found dead in her Houston apartment with multiple stab wounds just days before her graduation. Police discovered her after a welfare check, also finding a man in critical condition with stab wounds in another room. Her sister has organized a GoFundMe to repatriate her remains to the UK, where it has already raised over $58,000. Odunsi, who documented her experiences as a Briton living in the US on TikTok, had expressed excitement about graduating and planned a holiday, and the police are investigating the case.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, downplayed recent stock market volatility during the company's annual meeting, calling it "really nothing" and a normal part of investing. He cited three instances in the past six decades where Berkshire Hathaway stock declined by 50%, noting that the company's fundamentals remained strong during those periods. Buffett stated that he would view a 50% drop in Berkshire's stock as a "fantastic opportunity" and emphasized his lack of fear regarding financial market fluctuations. He reassured investors that the recent market activity should not be considered a dramatic bear market.</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners had to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) because an Army Black Hawk helicopter took a "scenic route" near the Pentagon, violating safety standards. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the incident "unacceptable," especially after a mid-air collision between a Black Hawk and a passenger jet three months prior resulted in 67 fatalities. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, and Duffy plans to discuss the matter with the Defense Department. Restrictions on helicopter flights near DCA were implemented after the January collision, but the article reports that these rules were disregarded.</p>

          <p>At least seven people were killed and 20 injured after a hospital and market were bombed in South Sudan, according to Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The medical charity reported that helicopter gunships bombed the pharmacy of their hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, destroying medical supplies, before firing on the town for 30 minutes. A drone then bombed a local market, and MSF has condemned the attack as a "clear violation of international humanitarian law".

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, ordered by President Trump to promote domestic manufacturing, follow previous tariffs on imported cars. The tariffs on parts will not apply to components from Canada or Mexico that meet the requirements of the North American trade agreement. Automakers and suppliers warn that relocating assembly lines will take years, and uncertainty about trade policy is hindering domestic manufacturing investments. The tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles.</p>

Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's underperformance during the campaign. Energy policy and inflation were central issues, with both sides acknowledging a cost-of-living crisis. Albanese's Labor Party accused Dutton's party of emulating U.S. President Trump's divisive politics, while Albanese highlighted improved relations with China. The U.S. congratulated Albanese on his re-election, underscoring Australia's role as a valued ally.</p>

Official sample vote counts indicate the PAP is set to win 87 seats in Parliament, while the opposition Workers Party is expected to retain its 10 seats.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party, which had trailed in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, suffered a resounding defeat, losing his parliamentary seat. Voters cited financial struggles, with some opting for the Australian Greens. Dutton's campaign echoed some of President Trump's messaging, but Albanese emphasized facing global challenges "the Australian way." The victory marks a recovery from the failed 2023 referendum on Indigenous rights, a key issue during Albanese's first term.</p>

          <p>Harvard President Alan Garber is navigating a complex situation, defending the university against federal intrusion while also addressing concerns about campus culture. While fighting the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding and strip Harvard of its tax-exempt status, Garber agrees that the university has issues with free speech and antisemitism. He is implementing changes to address these concerns, including revising student discipline policies, managing protests, and promoting ideological diversity. Some critics argue that these changes align with Trump's agenda, while supporters see them as necessary to preserve the university's integrity.</p>

          <p>Capital One believes it can significantly enhance the value of its acquisition of Discover Financial by expanding Discover's payment network internationally. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that global expansion would enable Capital One to shift more of its branded credit cards away from Visa and Mastercard, exceeding initial synergy estimates. Capital One expects $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027 through expense savings and network benefits. The debit-card business will also receive a regulatory benefit by running on the Discover network, exempting it from swipe fee caps. Analysts estimate that building Discover's international presence will take several years and require strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is no longer a wild notion after Reform's stunning success in recent elections. The party's performance has shaken the two traditional main parties, with Labour needing to prove its ability to govern effectively and the Conservatives struggling to present a serious image. Reform's success is attributed to Farage's ability to seize on issues and create news coverage. While Reform has built a strong campaigning machine, it now faces the challenge of governing effectively and demonstrating its ability to run things responsibly.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that domestication has caused cats and dogs to evolve to look more alike, with similar skull shapes, due to human selection. Selective breeding has exaggerated traits, such as flat faces, leading to health problems in both species. The human preference for infant-like features triggers caregiving instincts, but these traits often come at a cost to the animals' health and welfare. Reports highlight concerns about extreme physical traits and hereditary health issues, calling for stricter regulations of breeders. Understanding the forces driving convergence between species highlights the powerful role humans play in shaping evolution.</p>

          <p>Physicist Melvin Vopson suggests that gravity could be the result of the universe trying to minimize clutter, behaving like a computer algorithm. This interpretation supports the possibility that our universe is a simulated construct. Vopson's theory builds on his "second law of information dynamics," arguing that gravity pulls matter together to minimize entropy, similar to a computer compressing data. He proposes that information stored in elementary cells informs the coordinates of matter, akin to pixelation in a digital simulation. The claim is that the gravitational attraction is just another optimising mechanism in a computational process that has the role to compress information.</p>

The "reciprocal tariffs" were introduced in early April, as American retailers were preparing to stock their shelves for festival celebrations later in the year. Industry insiders said the best-available solutions are to either absorb the additional costs of Chinese imports or source the products from places less affected by tariffs, an approach that could come at the expense of product quality. New Jerseyâ€™s Halloween & Costume Association stated that US tariffs of 145 per cent or higher had seen the market for new imports from China grind to a halt.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Fivespan Partners has taken a stake in Qiagen NV, a life sciences tools firm, and is engaging with management to unlock shareholder value. Fivespan believes Qiagen is a high-quality business in a growing industry but has underperformed its peers. Fivespan has identified three key levers: investing in its core business, improving margins through tighter management, and optimizing the balance sheet by increasing leverage. They feel that the company could benefit from additional investments in its core business and buy back some of its own stock at attractive prices ahead of growth and margin improvements. Fivespan appreciates businesses with several paths to shareholder value, one of them being strategic transactions.</p>
