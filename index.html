          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:33:23 EDT</div>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has issued a 2025 earnings outlook that is significantly below Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to drop amid ongoing struggles. The company is grappling with persistently high medical costs, particularly within its Medicare Advantage plans, as more seniors undergo procedures delayed during the pandemic. UnitedHealth's second-quarter results also missed profit estimates, with its medical care ratio increasing, indicating lower profitability from premiums collected. The company anticipates a return to earnings growth in 2026 and is undergoing reviews of its business practices amid Justice Department investigations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of Afghans who fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover are facing the threat of deportation while waiting for humanitarian visas to Germany. Many of these individuals, including journalists and activists, were accepted into a German admission program but are now in limbo due to processing delays and a tougher German stance on migration. Pakistan has intensified its deportation drives, affecting even those with pending applications for resettlement in Western countries. The situation leaves these at-risk Afghans in a state of extreme anxiety, caught between potential deportation to a hostile homeland and an uncertain future.</p>

          <h2>Spotify Reports Net Loss and Weak Guidance, Citing Advertising Business Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:26:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spotify's shares declined significantly after the company reported a net loss for the second quarter and provided weak guidance for the upcoming period. The music streaming service missed Wall Street's earnings expectations, attributing the results to higher personnel costs and other charges. CEO Daniel Ek expressed dissatisfaction with the performance of the platform's advertising business, calling it an "execution challenge" despite seeing promise in its potential. While monthly active users and premium subscribers grew, the company's forecast for third-quarter revenue fell short of analyst predictions, partly due to foreign exchange headwinds.

          <p>The recent mass shooting in a Manhattan office building has brought renewed attention to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma. The gunman, who died by suicide, was reportedly carrying a note claiming he suffered from the condition, which is often found in athletes and military veterans. CTE can cause mood changes, confusion, and memory loss, but it can only be definitively diagnosed through a post-mortem autopsy. The article explains that researchers look for specific changes to tau proteins in the brain to confirm the disease, a focus of study at institutions like Boston University's UNITE Brain Bank.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Sean "Diddy" Combs are requesting his release from jail ahead of his October sentencing, arguing there are "exceptional reasons" for him not to be detained. Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted on more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His attorneys contend that the law used for his conviction has never been applied to a case involving a consensual "swingers lifestyle" between a person and their long-term partner. They have proposed a $50 million bail and home confinement in Miami, but the judge previously denied bail, citing a presumption of detention in the law.</p>

          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day workweek has identified three key strategies for their success. According to economist Juliet Schor, these businesses effectively get the same amount of work done in less time by cutting down on inefficient meetings, re-engineering work processes for better efficiency, and eliminating low-impact tasks. For example, companies conducted calendar audits to shorten or delete unnecessary meetings and empowered factory workers to streamline their own workflows. By focusing on high-impact work and improving productivity, these companies have seen benefits like reduced burnout, higher engagement, and boosted profits.</p>

          <p>A wildlife park in Pembrokeshire, Wales, is celebrating the birth of four rare Sumatran tiger cubs, the largest litter ever born in the United Kingdom. The arrival of the cubs at Manor House Wildlife Park provides a significant boost for the critically endangered species, of which fewer than 400 are estimated to remain in the wild. The birth is the result of a carefully managed European breeding program designed to ensure genetic diversity and the long-term survival of the species. The zoo's owner expressed excitement over the event, highlighting it as a rare and important opportunity for conservation and public education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece for The Guardian, columnist Arwa Mahdawi critiques the recent efforts by some conservative media figures to reframe Ghislaine Maxwell as a victim who suffered a miscarriage of justice. The article suggests this rehabilitation tour is politically motivated, potentially laying the groundwork for a pardon from Donald Trump in exchange for information that could benefit him. Mahdawi points to the involvement of figures like Alan Dershowitz and the pro-Trump outlet Newsmax in this narrative shift. The author concludes by emphasizing the credibility of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, who have consistently identified Maxwell as a key participant in their abuse.</p>

During the meeting at Trump's golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Swinney advocated for an exemption for Scotch whisky from the 10% tariff, highlighting its unique status as a product that can only be made in Scotland. The First Minister also urged the president to use his influence to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Trump, who later called Swinney a "terrific guy," also raised the issue of oil and gas taxation in the North Sea during their conversation.</p>

The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, had suspended its guidance earlier due to tariff uncertainties. The new CEO, Antonio Filosa, acknowledged that 2025 is a "tough year" and stated that the leadership team will make difficult decisions to fix issues, particularly in its North American segment, and re-establish profitable growth.
