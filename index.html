          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the high-profile death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a contentious retrial. After four days of deliberation, the jury found her guilty only of driving under the influence of alcohol, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. The defense consistently claimed an elaborate cover-up by law enforcement, suggesting O'Keefe was beaten inside a home before his body was left outside. Prosecutors, however, maintained Read struck him with her SUV and left him to die in the snow. The case garnered significant media attention, including a prior mistrial and internal investigations into lead police officers.</p>

This tour has now become the highest-attended in history, selling over 12 million tickets globally. Frontman Chris Martin engaged the audience with his energetic stage presence and humor, fostering a strong sense of unity through LED wristbands and communal singalongs, making the audience an integral part of the show. The band incorporated special guests, including Venezuela's Simón Bolívar Orchestra, and delivered a musically stacked setlist that reaffirmed their status as a premier stadium act, despite Martin's whimsical claim that it would be their final album.</p>

          <p>China's retail market is undergoing rapid evolution, driven by an intense "instant commerce war" between tech giants like Alibaba and Meituan. This fierce competition has led to aggressive promotional subsidies and incredibly swift deliveries, expanding beyond food to include high-value items like new iPhones, which can be delivered in as little as 30 minutes. Consumers are benefiting from ultra-low prices, with some orders costing mere cents. This rivalry, also involving JD.com, signifies a significant transformation in Chinese retailing, blurring the lines between online platforms and traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, and pushing for ever-greater efficiency in order fulfillment across the country.</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has accused Farmington Board of Education Chairman Bill Beckert, a Democrat, of celebrating the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The GOP shared a screenshot of Beckert's alleged social media post, which reposted a comment stating, "They Reap What They Sow," following Kirk's fatal shooting. State Republican Chairman Ben Proto condemned the action as "grotesque" and a "betrayal of values every educator and public servant should embody," interpreting it as an endorsement of political violence. This incident highlights the intense partisan divisions and heated rhetoric surrounding Kirk's death, prompting calls for Beckert's accountability and raising concerns about the example set for children in schools.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing growing pressure after initially defending former US ambassador Lord Mandelson, despite officials at No 10 and the Foreign Office reportedly being aware of supportive emails between Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Lord Mandelson was subsequently dismissed after the full extent of his relationship with Epstein, including emails expressing support during Epstein's legal troubles and paid travel, became public. The BBC understands that a media inquiry about the emails was sent to the Foreign Office before Starmer's initial defense. This situation has led to calls for Starmer to clarify his handling of the appointment and raised significant questions about transparency and judgment within the government.</p>

          <p>Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a prominent leader of the Belarusian opposition, has condemned the forced deportation of 52 political prisoners released by Belarus this week as part of a US-brokered deal. While the agreement, facilitated by the United States, will see sanctions on Belarus' national airline lifted, Tsikhanouskaya argues it's not "real freedom." Many of the prisoners, including an EU employee, were nearing the end of their terms and are now exiled to Lithuania, separated from their families and unable to return. She called on Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko permit political prisoners to remain in their home country, emphasizing the human cost of these "pardons" despite some thanking US President Trump.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, which is expected to create an additional GOP-leaning House seat, a move lauded by President Donald Trump. This plan would shift the state's delegation from six Republicans and two Democrats to seven Republicans and one Democrat, largely by splitting up the Kansas City area. The move is part of a nationwide redistricting push by Republicans to maintain their razor-thin House majority. Opponents, including the ACLU of Missouri, have already filed a legal challenge, arguing the map is unconstitutional, uncompact, and racially gerrymandered, raising significant concerns about its legality and fairness in the electoral process.</p>

          <p>A Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health study has found a significant link between experiences of stalking or obtaining restraining orders and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 American nurses over 20 years, revealed that women who experienced stalking had a 41% higher CVD risk, while those who obtained restraining orders faced a 70% higher risk. This association persisted even after accounting for other health factors, suggesting that these traumatic experiences directly impact cardiovascular health. Researchers hope the findings will prompt doctors to include questions about such violence in future heart health screenings to improve women's health.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, false claims and conspiracy theories rapidly spread across social media, with AI tools like X's Grok chatbot significantly amplifying misinformation. CBS News identified numerous instances where Grok misidentified the suspect, generated altered photos, and even reported Kirk was alive days after his death. Experts note that generative AI struggles with real-time accuracy, often prioritizing probability over factual verification, making it susceptible to spreading unverified information during breaking news. This incident highlights a growing concern about AI's role in exacerbating misinformation during sensitive events, especially as users often perceive machine-generated content as more reliable than human sources.</p>

While some progress is noted in areas like pension credit claims, the substantial amount of unclaimed support highlights a systemic issue where designed systems to help people are simultaneously difficult to access.

Investigators found engraved bullet casings at the scene with messages like "Hey fascist! Catch!" and references to online memes and an Italian antifascism song.

Other valuation metrics, like the 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio and the Shiller CAPE ratio, also indicate significant market froth. While high valuations reflect expectations for AI-driven earnings, Hartnett's message to investors is "It better be different this time," implying that current optimism needs to be justified by sustained profits to avoid a correction.

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to end a federal reporting rule that tracks greenhouse gas emissions from over 8,000 industrial facilities, including power plants and refineries. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated this move would save American businesses $2.4 billion in regulatory costs and streamline operations, while still complying with the Clean Air Act. However, environmental and health experts strongly warn that ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would blind Americans to critical climate pollution data, hindering policy decisions and making it more difficult to produce studies on the economic and societal impact of emissions. This decision aligns with the administration's broader efforts to reduce support for climate research.</p>

          <p>A new report from US House Republicans is escalating efforts to target US-China joint institutes and degree programs, identifying dozens as "high-risk" and calling for their termination. The report names approximately 50 ongoing partnerships, including programs at New York University and Johns Hopkins, citing concerns they could advance Beijing's military and technological modernization. Factors for deeming a partnership "high-risk" include links to China's "seven sons of national defense" or ties to defense or intelligence end-uses. This move reflects growing apprehension in Congress about academic collaborations, suggesting a hardening stance on intellectual property and national security implications of educational exchanges with China.</p>

          <p>Controversial artist Andres Serrano, known for "Piss Christ," discussed his portraits of convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, offering unique insights into both figures. Serrano photographed Epstein in 2019, four months before his death, motivated by acquiring a desired sculpture. He described Epstein as "uninteresting" except for his crimes, noting Epstein's habit of "collecting people" rather than art. Serrano also recounted photographing Trump in 2004, finding him "fascinating" and the "epitome of the American dream." The artist's reflections highlight the differing public perceptions and complex legacies of these prominent individuals, as well as the artist's detached approach to his subjects.</p>

          <p>An undocumented woman, identified as 'Luz,' shared her harrowing experience of living in constant fear in Trump's America, where increased ICE enforcement has led to a climate of terror among certain communities. Luz, who has lived in the US for 17 years and has a US citizen daughter, describes being afraid to leave her home or take her child to school, witnessing neighbors being detained. Despite contributing to society through work and taxes, she faces the threat of deportation under the Trump administration's policy to remove all undocumented individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The review for "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" suggests that while the sight of the original trio reuniting offers some nostalgic smiles, the sequel largely fails to recapture the sharp satire of the 1984 mockumentary classic. The film struggles with the concept of the band being revered by music legends, which "saps the comedy of outsider tension." Despite agreeable silliness in exploring the characters' solo lives, the forced reunion for an arena show and repeated gags, like the drummer mortality problem, fall flat. The article concludes that the movie feels more like an extended outtake reel than a fresh, pointed take on rock-and-roll absurdity, ultimately not living up to its predecessor's iconic legacy.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can end legal protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, overturning a lower court's stay. This decision, a victory for the administration, allows the termination of humanitarian parole protections while a lawsuit against the policy proceeds. Lawyers for the migrants expressed deep disappointment, citing risks of irreparable harm, family separation, and return to dangerous home countries. They called it the "largest mass illegalization event in modern American history." The ruling underscores the administration's commitment to dismantling Biden-era immigration policies and pressing for the removal of these migrants, despite ongoing legal challenges and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is suing Uber for allegedly discriminating against passengers with disabilities, including those with service dogs. The Department of Justice claims Uber drivers routinely refuse service, impose illegal cleaning fees for service animal shedding, and charge cancellation fees after denials. Disabled individuals have reportedly missed appointments, experienced significant delays, and been stranded in inclement weather due to these alleged practices. Uber, the largest ride-hailing company, denies the allegations, stating its policies prohibit such discrimination and that it takes action, including deactivating driver accounts, when violations are confirmed. The lawsuit seeks $125 million for affected individuals and aims to ensure safe and respectful experiences for all riders.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a landmark housing bill designed to significantly increase housing density near transit hubs across the state. The bill overrides local zoning laws, allowing for taller, denser buildings—up to nine stories—adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations. Proponents argue these drastic measures are necessary to address California's severe housing affordability crisis, with estimates suggesting it could unlock hundreds of thousands of new multifamily homes. Critics, however, claim the blanket mandate is an overreach that strips local authorities of control and could disproportionately affect lower-priced neighborhoods, sparking protests from residents concerned about changing community character.</p>
