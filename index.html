          <p>US President Donald Trump has urged residents of Tehran to evacuate the city following Israeli missile attacks. In a Truth Social post, Trump stated that Iran should have signed a deal he proposed and reiterated that Iran cannot possess a nuclear weapon. The United States and Iran were in the middle of negotiations over Iran's nuclear program when Israel launched its attack. Trump is leaving the G7 summit early due to the situation in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>There is a growing number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness, raising concerns among health workers. Over 140,000 older Americans are homeless on any given day, and this number is expected to triple by 2030. Common causes of homelessness include the death of a spouse, divorce, job loss, eviction, or medical issues. This trend is placing a strain on healthcare systems, as these individuals often require complex medical care and have limited support.</p>

          <p>A recent survey suggests that young people under 18 are increasingly aware of nicotine pouches, with 43% of 11-17 year olds knowing about them, up from 38% in 2024. Nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, equivalent to 210,000 young people. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) is urging the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill to ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are considered less harmful than smoking but are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.</p>
