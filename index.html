          <p>Nicaragua has officially withdrawn from UNESCO in response to the organization's decision to award the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize to the exiled Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret over the decision, emphasizing that it deprives the Nicaraguan people of opportunities for cooperation in education and culture. La Prensa has been publishing from abroad after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's government tightened its control, leading to the arrest and deportation of its general manager. Nicaraguan authorities have accused La Prensa of promoting US interventions in the country, leading to this diplomatic rift with UNESCO.</p>

          <p>Active management is experiencing a resurgence in a market that has long been dominated by index funds. Recent data shows a net outflow from equity ETFs, with the selling primarily on the index fund side, and inflows into active equity ETFs.

Investors are increasingly identifying funds that take a unique approach, and are not just 'closet indexers,' and are urged to avoid panic trading and remain invested for the long term.

          <p>A girls' track meet in Maine has ignited controversy after a trans athlete's victories in multiple running events, intensifying the state's ongoing legal conflict with the Trump administration over trans athletes in girls' sports. The athlete, competing for North Yarmouth Academy, won the 800-meter and 1600-meter races, sparking debate among residents, politicians, and national pundits. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Maine for its trans-inclusive policies, while the state government maintains its support, citing the Maine Human Rights Act.

          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to power, tens of thousands of federal workers have experienced job insecurity due to mass firings and subsequent court-ordered reinstatements, creating a state of limbo and confusion. The firings, executed by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge), have been challenged in court, leading to whiplashing orders and inconsistent treatment of probationary workers. While some have been rehired with backpay, others remain on administrative leave or have been fired again. The administration's actions have drawn criticism for eroding job security and demoralizing the federal workforce, with concerns raised about the loss of expertise and potential impacts on government services.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested family members of Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician who protested against China's new "mega-embassy" in London. Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, participated in a rally against the embassy's construction, arguing it sends the wrong message about Britain welcoming authoritarian regimes. Within 48 hours of her remarks, Chinese national security police arrested her elderly aunt and uncle in Hong Kong, followed by another aunt a week later. Lau believes the harassment is an attempt by the Chinese regime to silence her "anti-Chinese" activities in the UK.</p>

          <p>Dozens of arts organizations across the United States have received notices that their government grant offers have been terminated, coinciding with President Trump's proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The cancellation of grants, including a $25,000 offer to a playhouse in Portland, Oregon, has sparked outrage among Democrats and arts unions. The proposed budget plan also includes cuts to public broadcasters, aligning with Trump's past efforts to eliminate government support for arts and humanities.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy has identified the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a particularly damaging element in relationship conflicts. This type of comparison, often used during arguments, can lead to feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, causing partners to question their worth. The root cause of this behavior often stems from a fear of openly expressing needs and frustrations, leading to a build-up of resentment. The article advises that couples should communicate their needs clearly and directly, fostering a sense of safety and emotional closeness.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's top aides considered having the then-president take a cognitive test in February 2024, as concerns about his mental acuity and age were rising. However, they ultimately decided against it, fearing that it would raise further questions about his abilities. Biden ultimately stepped down from his re-election campaign, ceding the way for Kamala Harris. The book suggests that a poor debate performance and mounting pressure led to Biden's decision, ultimately resulting in Donald Trump's second term.</p>
