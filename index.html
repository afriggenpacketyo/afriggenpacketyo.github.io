          <p>The Treasury Department is reportedly considering a $1 coin design for the U.S. 250th anniversary featuring President Trump's profile on one side and an image from a 2024 assassination attempt with his "FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT" quote on the other. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the drafts are real, pending the government shutdown's end. While commemorative coins are legal tender, a 2021 law signed by Trump for the anniversary states no living person's portrait may be on the reverse, and an 1866 law tradition avoids living presidents on currency. A final design has not been selected, and the Treasury did not comment on the legality.</p>

          <p>Investing in precious metals like gold and silver offers valuable portfolio diversification, acting as a hedge against inflation and market volatility. Common investment methods include Gold or Silver IRAs, which provide tax advantages but may incur higher fees for setup, management, and storage. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) offer liquidity and convenience, tracking metal prices with lower annual fees than physical bullion. Investors can also consider individual mining stocks or directly purchase physical gold and silver bars and coins, though physical ownership involves storage and insurance costs.

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs received a sentence of 50 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release and a $500,000 fine, as handed down by District Judge Arun Subramanian. The judge acknowledged Combs' difficult situation but underscored the severe nature of his crimes, giving credit for 12 months already served. Attorney Doug Wigdor, representing victim Cassie Ventura, affirmed that the sentence validates the impact of Combs' serious offenses, hoping it supports Ventura's ongoing healing process. The court also recognized the bravery and fortitude of Ventura and 'Jane' for their testimony, noting their significant impact on many.</p>

          <p>Bankruptcy filings are increasing, but strict eligibility criteria exist for Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Disqualifying factors include failing the Chapter 7 means test, recent bankruptcy discharges, not completing mandatory credit counseling, fraudulent behavior like concealing assets, or recent luxury purchases on credit. If disqualified, alternatives like debt consolidation, debt settlement, debt management programs, or asset liquidation can help manage debt. Consulting a bankruptcy attorney is crucial to evaluate individual situations and determine the best path forward.</p>

          <p>Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador after over 100 days in U.S. custody, following a court's denial of his appeal to stay. Guevara was arrested while covering a protest in June, with charges later dismissed, but ICE took custody citing a prior asylum denial. His family expressed shock, unable to say goodbye, while the ACLU condemned his treatment as a threat to press freedom. Guevara expressed mixed feelings upon arriving in El Salvador but affirmed his readiness to continue working.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer a $2,500 stipend to unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older who voluntarily return to their home countries, excluding those from Mexico. This initiative, aimed at increasing self-deportations, targets minors in HHS custody. Critics argue that offering money to vulnerable children could distort the voluntary departure process and endanger their lives, stressing the importance of meaningful legal guidance. This policy is part of broader efforts to encourage unauthorized immigrants to leave the U.S. voluntarily.</p>

The core disagreement remains healthcare, with Democrats pushing for subsidies and Republicans accusing them of seeking healthcare for undocumented immigrants.

          <p>Recent college graduates are encountering significant difficulties in the job market, with the unemployment rate for "new entrants" reaching a nine-year peak. Data suggests a bachelor's degree no longer guarantees access to white-collar jobs as it once did, narrowing the unemployment gap between degree holders and those with only high school diplomas. This trend is attributed to an increased share of young Americans obtaining four-year degrees and the rising impact of artificial intelligence automating entry-level roles. The struggle is causing stress and self-doubt among young job seekers.</p>

          <p>Hamas has indicated willingness to accept parts of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including releasing all remaining hostages and transferring Gaza's administration to a Palestinian technocratic body, while seeking further negotiations on other issues. Simultaneously, UN experts have criticized key elements of Trump's plan as "deeply inconsistent with fundamental rules of international law" and reminiscent of "colonial practices," particularly the proposed "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. The situation for mothers and newborns in Gaza is described as dire by UNICEF, with reports of extreme overcrowding and lack of essentials.</p>

          <p>U.S. sales of all-electric vehicles, excluding hybrids, reached record highs, surpassing 1 million units in the first nine months of the year and setting a new quarterly record. Tesla and General Motors are leading the market, with GM notably increasing its market share. This surge was partly driven by consumers accelerating purchases before federal incentives, up to $7,500, ended in September due to the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Industry analysts predict a potential decline in EV sales following the cessation of these credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hamas has accepted some elements of President Trump's Gaza peace plan, including releasing remaining hostages and disarming, while insisting other aspects require Palestinian consensus. Trump's ultimatum threatened severe military action if the deal wasn't accepted by Sunday evening. The plan, supported by Israel, proposes an end to fighting, Israeli withdrawal, and humanitarian aid. However, it offers no path for West Bank reunification in a future Palestinian state, and Gaza City faces famine. Hamas remains firm on a lasting ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal for full disarmament.</p>

While ChatGPT has 700 million weekly users for tasks like recipes and coding, concerns about AI "hallucinations" and mental health impacts persist.

          <p>Elon Musk called for followers to cancel Netflix subscriptions, citing a "transgender woke agenda" linked to the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park." This follows conservative backlash and accusations against the show's creator. While shares saw a nearly 5% dip, analysts believe the boycott is unlikely to significantly impact Netflix's subscriber numbers or its substantial market cap. They suggest any effect would be fleeting and potentially offset by increased ad revenue, contrasting it with more impactful boycotts like that of Bud Light.</p>
