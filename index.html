          <p>A third-floor apartment balcony collapsed in Cincinnati, injuring at least ten people, with one individual reported to be in critical condition. The incident occurred in the Corryville neighborhood near the University of Cincinnati, and some of the injured were students who were reportedly celebrating after an exam. The cause of the collapse of the 8-by-12-foot wooden structure is currently under investigation by fire and police officials. In response, the university has offered support, including housing assistance and counseling, to any affected students.</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou has been fired as head coach of Nottingham Forest just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. His dismissal followed a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, capping a winless run of eight matches across all competitions. The club, now searching for its third manager this season, is reportedly considering several candidates, including Fulham's Marco Silva and former Everton manager Sean Dyche. Postecoglou's brief and unsuccessful stint has left the team just one point above the relegation zone.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was released from a New Jersey prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The release, which occurred less than three months into his sentence, was championed by Republican allies such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. The decision has drawn widespread criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, reigniting debates over the use of presidential power and the integrity of the justice system. Santos had previously pleaded for fairness in an open letter to the president.</p>

          <p>A Cameroonian-flagged tanker loaded with liquefied petroleum gas caught fire in the Gulf of Aden, leading the crew to abandon the vessel with at least one mariner reported missing. British military officials suggested the ship, named the Falcon, was struck by a projectile, while an EU naval force indicated the fire may have been accidental. The vessel, previously identified as part of an Iranian "ghost fleet" used to transport oil despite sanctions, now poses a significant explosion risk. Houthi rebels, who have previously targeted shipping in the area, have not claimed responsibility for the incident.</p>

          <p>A significant security vulnerability in ChatGPT's Deep Research tool, dubbed ShadowLeak, allowed hackers to steal Gmail data through invisible prompts embedded in emails. Security researchers discovered the zero-click flaw, which required no user interaction and executed entirely in the cloud, making it undetectable by conventional antivirus software. OpenAI was notified and patched the vulnerability in August 2025, but experts warn that similar exploits could emerge as AI integrations with platforms like Google Drive and Dropbox become more common. The incident highlights the growing security risks associated with advanced AI agents.</p>

          <p>The German-English phrase "Das crazy" has been selected as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025, reflecting the growing influence of English and internet culture on youth slang. The term, a grammatically unconventional mix of a German article and an English adjective, is used to express surprise, speechlessness, or irony. Chosen through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase narrowly beat out competitors like "goonen." The selection highlights a trend towards brevity and the deliberate, humorous breaking of language rules among young Germans.</p>

This move follows KDP's controversial decision to merge with JDE Peet's, a deal that caused its stock to drop 25% due to its structure and financing. Starboard, known for its expertise in improving operational efficiency, is expected to push for changes to restore investor confidence and unlock value. The firm's involvement may lead to board representation and a more constructive path forward as KDP navigates this strategic inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

To prepare them, she advises starting conversations about responsible technology use by late elementary school, around age 10. Key strategies include teaching children about online privacy, the value of their time, and setting firm rules like no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge suggests that a child's first device should be a basic phone without internet access, emphasizing moderation and clear parental controls.</p>

This policy has caused confusion and concern among non-binary and transgender travelers, who fear they may face difficulties or be denied entry when flying internationally. While courts have affirmed the validity of 'X' marker passports, legal experts suggest the rule could empower individual agents to act on personal biases.

          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his investment philosophy, dividing assets into three categories: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards the first two, particularly gold, which he describes as an inert asset whose value depends solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it later. Buffett strongly favors the third category—productive assets like farms and businesses—because their value is based on what they can generate over time. This approach, he explains, means focusing on an asset's long-term output rather than its short-term price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant political gender gap has emerged among Gen Z in the United States, with young women identifying as the most left-leaning demographic in recent history while their male peers trend more conservative. This divergence is attributed to young women feeling more directly impacted by issues like reproductive rights, economic inequality, and the threat of authoritarianism. Many reject the 'liberal' label associated with the Democratic party, viewing it as too centrist and beholden to corporate interests. The article suggests that for these women, a leftist political identity is a form of self-defense in a world they perceive as increasingly unstable and inequitable.</p>
