          <p>In the trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the jury informed the court they had reached a partial verdict, but Judge Arun Subramanian instructed them to continue deliberating to reach a unanimous decision on all counts. The judge reread specific instructions emphasizing the duty to consult and deliberate with fellow jurors without surrendering honest convictions. Both the prosecution and defense agreed with the judge's decision to push for a complete verdict rather than accepting a partial one. The jury is set to resume deliberations the following morning, leaving the final outcome of the high-profile case pending.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a stringent new anti-smoking law, banning smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The legislation aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, as tobacco-related illnesses claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. Violators of the new ban face significant fines, potentially up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While the move is supported by health organizations and a majority of the public, some smokers feel their freedoms are being restricted, with cafÃ© terraces remaining one of the last public refuges for them.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by a convincing 24-run margin in Bristol, taking a 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. Despite a strong start from England's bowlers that left India at 31-3, a pivotal 93-run partnership between Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur powered the tourists to a competitive total of 181-4. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and failing to recover despite a half-century from Tammy Beaumont. The victory showcases India's growing strength and consistency ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup, while highlighting recurring weaknesses for England.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Culiacan, Mexico, discovered 20 bodies on Monday, highlighting the escalating violence in the cartel-plagued region. The gruesome findings included four decapitated corpses hanging from a highway bridge and 16 additional bodies with gunshot wounds found in a van on the same freeway. The violence is attributed to an ongoing war for control between rival factions of the Sinaloa cartel, Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. Despite government assurances of working to restore peace, residents report that authorities have lost control of the situation, which follows recent U.S. sanctions designating Los Chapitos as a terrorist organization for its role in fentanyl trafficking.</p>

          <p>A newly restructured government advisory panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. This recommendation, which the CDC must still approve, targets a substance long criticized by the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. Health experts express concern that this move could reinforce unfounded fears and, if enacted, potentially reduce the flu vaccine supply, as about 4-5% of shots still use thimerosal in multi-dose vials. The decision follows the appointment of several vaccine skeptics to the panel by the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has again floated the controversial and potentially unconstitutional idea of deporting U.S. citizens who commit serious crimes. Speaking to the press, he suggested that individuals, including those born in the U.S., should be removed from the country for criminal actions, stating he would pursue it if legally possible. This proposal follows a recent memo from the Justice Department granting U.S. attorneys wider discretion in denaturalization cases. Legal experts have warned that such a policy would likely violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment and that citizenship can typically only be revoked for naturalized citizens in rare cases of fraud.</p>

It also proposes raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 and increasing the child tax credit.

While the father of victim Madison Mogen expressed relief at avoiding a prolonged trial and appeals process, the family of Kaylee Goncalves stated they were "beyond furious" and had not been consulted.

          <p>During a press conference, President Donald Trump threatened to jail New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani if he interferes with ICE arrests and also considered prosecution for former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Trump labeled Mamdani a "communist" and questioned his citizenship. These remarks came shortly after the president feuded with Elon Musk over a new spending bill, suggesting he might look into deporting the naturalized U.S. citizen and directing a government efficiency department to review Musk's federal subsidies. The comments represent a significant escalation of rhetoric against political and business figures who have criticized his administration.</p>

          <p>Renowned composer Alexandre Desplat has taken on the challenge of scoring the new film "Jurassic World: Rebirth," stepping into the musical world created by his idol, John Williams. In the article, Desplat reflects on his career, from his unique French-influenced style to his collaborations with directors like Wes Anderson and Guillermo del Toro. For "Rebirth," he aimed to honor Williams' iconic themes while introducing new motifs for adventure and danger, balancing his own artistic tendencies with the director's push for memorable, hummable melodies. Desplat emphasizes the importance of strong, catchy themes, an art he worries is becoming rare in modern Hollywood scores.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has officially ended its operations, with its remaining programs now being administered by the State Department. Officials state the move is intended to align foreign assistance more directly with U.S. national interests and administration policies. The closure follows a push by the Department of Government Efficiency to scale back the federal government. The decision has drawn criticism from humanitarian organizations and former presidents, who warn of devastating consequences. A new study in The Lancet forecasts that the cuts to USAID funding could lead to over 14 million additional deaths by 2030.</p>

          <p>Authoritative national climate assessment reports, which are legally mandated, appear to have been removed from the federal government websites designed to host them. Scientists and former government officials warn that the disappearance of these peer-reviewed reports deprives local governments and the public of crucial information needed to prepare for the impacts of climate change. The assessments provide localized data that helps in making critical infrastructure and safety decisions.

This article places his mega-deal in the context of other major professional sports, noting that while MLB contracts like Shohei Ohtani's and Juan Soto's have higher total values, top NBA players earn more per year due to smaller roster sizes. The analysis compares his earnings to the top contracts in the NFL, which are dominated by quarterbacks, and MLB. It concludes that Gilgeous-Alexander's deal is a low-risk investment given his age and elite performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Collins cited the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid, warning it would threaten healthcare access for nearly a third of her state's population and endanger rural hospitals. Paul, a fiscal conservative, opposed the bill for not doing enough to rein in the national debt. Tillis, who recently announced his retirement after clashing with Trump, also voiced strong opposition to the Medicaid provisions and their potential impact on his constituents in North Carolina.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is on the verge of reaching the historic 3,000-strikeout milestone, a testament to his enduring mastery of a three-pitch arsenal: fastball, slider, and curveball. The article traces the development of his signature slider in 2009, which transformed him into a dominant force. Despite battling injuries and diminished velocity in recent years, the 37-year-old has continued to adapt and perform at an elite level. Teammates and coaches attribute his prolonged success not just to physical talent but to his exceptional baseball intellect, relentless competitiveness, and ability to continually reinvent his approach on the mound.</p>

          <h2>Over 170 NGOs Call for Dismantling of U.S.-Backed Gaza Aid System Amid Safety Concerns</h2>

          <p>A coalition of more than 170 non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam and Doctors Without Borders, is demanding the dissolution of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF is a U.S. and Israeli-backed system that uses private firms for aid delivery, bypassing the UN. The NGOs argue the system is "inherently unsafe," citing reports that over 500 people have been killed near GHF distribution sites guarded by the Israeli military. They contend the plan forces desperate people to risk their lives for food and breaches humanitarian principles, urging a return to a UN-coordinated aid process to ensure civilian safety.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has identified Bend, Oregon, as the city with the best job market in the United States, followed by Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington. The ranking of 348 cities was based on six key metrics, including unemployment rate, income growth, health insurance coverage, commute time, remote work prevalence, and housing affordability. Bend scored highly for its low unemployment, significant income growth of 44% since 2020, and excellent work-life balance, featuring a short 16-minute median commute. The study also highlighted cities like Santa Clara, California, for health coverage and Frisco, Texas, for a high percentage of remote workers.</p>

          <p>A person walking on a beach in Walton County, Florida, discovered a large quantity of cocaine, valued at nearly half a million dollars, that had washed ashore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were found wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office confiscated the drugs and used the incident to remind the public not to touch suspicious packages found on the beach, as their contents could be dangerous. This discovery is the latest in a series of incidents where large quantities of illicit drugs, often in uniquely marked packages, have washed up along Florida's extensive coastline.</p>
