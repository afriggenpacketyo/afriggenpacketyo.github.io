          <p>The U.S. State Department is planning a pilot program that could require some foreign travelers on business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000. This measure targets individuals from countries with high rates of visa overstays, aiming to encourage compliance with departure dates. The program, a response to a Trump administration executive order, has drawn criticism from policy experts who argue it will deter tourism and harm the U.S. economy. The specific countries affected will be announced later, but travelers under the Visa Waiver Program will not be included in this new requirement.</p>

          <p>The UK government has appointed business leader Moni Mannings to chair a new diversity and outreach committee for the national honours system. This initiative aims to make the prestigious awards more inclusive and representative of the entire country, addressing criticisms of regional and class-based disparities. Recent analysis revealed that a majority of high-level honours went to individuals in London and the South East, with very few recipients from working-class backgrounds. The new committee will advise on encouraging a broader range of nominations to ensure the system recognizes excellence from all walks of life.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson held a private dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Judea and Samaria, an area internationally recognized as the occupied West Bank. This visit marks the highest-level meeting for a U.S. official in the disputed territory and occurs amid discussions in the Israeli government about annexing the region. While the meeting focused on the Gaza war and humanitarian aid, its location is significant, aligning with Republican efforts to formally recognize the area by its biblical names. Johnson's delegation is also scheduled to meet with Palestinian leaders during the trip.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire, named the Gifford fire, has burned over 65,000 acres in California's Los Padres National Forest, leading to evacuation orders and threatening more than 450 structures. The blaze, which is only 3% contained, grew from several smaller fires and is being fueled by hot, dry conditions. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames, with concerns that erratic evening winds could accelerate its spread. Authorities have reported several injuries, including a hospitalized resident with burns and two contract employees hurt in an ATV accident while assisting firefighting efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers have left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, a legislative maneuver known as "breaking quorum." This tactic prevents the state House from conducting business by denying the majority party the required number of members present. While effective for delaying legislation and drawing national attention, history shows it rarely stops a bill's eventual passage, as governors can call continuous special sessions. This article explores past instances of legislative walkouts in Texas and other states, highlighting the increasing use of this strategy amid heightened political polarization.</p>

          <p>Rapper Soulja Boy, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. The arrest occurred early Sunday morning near his Melrose clothing store following a traffic stop where police identified him as a passenger. This incident adds to his recent legal troubles, including a civil court verdict in April where he was found liable for sexually assaulting and abusing a former assistant. He was booked into jail at the LAPD’s Wilshire Division, and further details about the traffic stop were not immediately available.</p>

          <p>Far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has been arrested in connection with an assault at St Pancras railway station in London. The arrest took place at Luton Airport as he arrived on a flight from Faro, Portugal. He was wanted for questioning after a man was found with serious but non-life-threatening injuries at the station on July 28. Robinson is being held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Video footage that circulated online after the incident showed him near a man lying motionless on the station floor, though it did not depict the assault itself.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has signaled it may reconsider key protections against racial gerrymandering, a move that could significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act. In a new order for the Louisiana v. Callais case, the court asked for briefings on whether requiring states to draw minority-majority districts is unconstitutional. This development suggests the court's conservative majority may be preparing to overturn the precedent set in the 1986 Thornburg v. Gingles case, which established the framework for challenging racial vote dilution. Such a decision would roll back one of the few remaining legal tools to fight gerrymandered electoral maps.</p>

          <p>The recent July jobs report, which showed a meager gain of 73,000 nonfarm payrolls, has amplified concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing down significantly. Coupled with major downward revisions to May and June's figures, the three-month average for job growth has fallen to just 35,000, pointing to a potential economic downturn. Economists are debating whether this slowdown will lead to a recession, citing pressures from tariffs on consumer spending and business investment. Despite a strong second-quarter GDP figure, underlying data suggests weaker growth, increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly praised a controversial American Eagle ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, whose voter registration was recently reported as Republican. The ad's slogan, playing on the words "jeans" and "genes," drew criticism from some who claimed it promoted eugenics or was overly sexualized. Trump called the ad "fantastic" and stated, "Being WOKE is for losers," injecting a political dimension into the cultural debate. American Eagle has maintained that the campaign slogan has always been about their denim products.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the constitutional separation of church and state, a foundational American principle, is facing unprecedented attacks. The author contends that recent legislative and judicial actions, such as using taxpayer money for religious education, are eroding the First Amendment's establishment clause. The article traces the history of this principle, highlighting how it has fostered religious pluralism and prevented the kinds of religious conflicts seen elsewhere. It warns that trading this successful system for one that blurs the lines between government and religion is a dangerous path for the nation.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by 23% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful initial public offering last week. The company's stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading, reflecting strong investor appetite for high-growth, profitable tech companies. Despite the recent drop, Figma's valuation remains nearly triple the amount Adobe had offered in a failed acquisition attempt in 2022. The company's strong revenue growth and consistent profitability have made it a standout in a historically slow IPO market. (not investment advice)</p>

The release is intended to counter accusations from Hamas that Israel is deliberately causing a famine in the region. COGAT asserts that aid is flowing into Gaza daily but claims Hamas is stealing it and creating a "fake famine narrative" for political purposes. This comes after Hamas released videos of emaciated hostages, claiming they were suffering the same conditions as the general population due to a lack of resources.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has demanded that police publicly disclose the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments follow the arrest of two men, reported to be Afghan nationals, in connection with an alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest, referencing the aftermath of a deadly attack in Southport last year. Current national police guidelines do not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after they have been charged.</p>

When the owners, brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad, tried to de-escalate the situation, the man pulled a knife, stabbing one in the chest and slashing the other on the arm. Both victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and the suspect remains at large as police continue their investigation.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's stock declined after the conglomerate reported a 4% drop in second-quarter operating earnings, driven by a downturn in its insurance underwriting business.

Warren Buffett's successor, Greg Abel, is set to take over as CEO at the end of 2025, and analysts noted that the lack of major acquisitions or share repurchases in the quarter was disappointing.

          <p>Many small and medium-sized business owners in the U.S. are warning that President Trump's recently updated tariffs will compel them to raise consumer prices. As inventory stockpiled before the tariffs were imposed begins to run out, businesses will face steep import costs on new orders from overseas. Economists predict this will lead to a pickup in goods prices in the second half of the year, potentially costing U.S. households an average of $2,400 in 2025. Business owners say moving manufacturing to the U.S. is not a simple or immediate solution, leaving them with difficult choices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The race to succeed Senator Mitch McConnell in Kentucky has become a battleground over his political legacy, even though he is not running for reelection. Republican candidate Nate Morris is harshly criticizing McConnell's 40-year tenure, aiming to appeal to anti-establishment Trump supporters by tethering his opponents to the long-serving senator. In contrast, other candidates and party activists are defending McConnell's strategic leadership and his role in building the state's GOP power. The dynamic reveals a rift within the party as it navigates a post-McConnell era in a state he has long dominated.</p>

          <p>Researchers have finally identified the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. A new study reveals the culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the coelomic fluid of infected animals. The epidemic has critically endangered the sunflower sea star, a keystone species whose decline has led to an explosion in sea urchin populations and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides hope for developing interventions, such as selective breeding or probiotics, to help restore sea star populations.</p>
