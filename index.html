            <p>The Department of Justice is appealing a federal judge's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. from El Salvador, where he was wrongly deported. Simultaneously, the DOJ released documents alleging Abrego Garcia's ties to the MS-13 gang, based on clothing and a confidential informant. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and wife deny his gang membership, questioning the validity of the evidence. The case has sparked controversy, with a DHS official admitting the deportation was a clerical error and should not have happened in the first place.</p>

            <p>In 1998, Jeff Bezos offered Netflix "low eight figures" to acquire the company, but co-founders Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings declined. The founders believed they were on the brink of something significant and decided to continue building their company independently. Later, in 2000, Netflix attempted to sell to Blockbuster for $50 million, but Blockbuster executives dismissed the offer. Netflix is now a global streaming giant with a market cap of over $400 billion.</p>

This oral alternative could give Eli Lilly a competitive edge in the growing weight loss market. The results are promising, though the pill fell short of some analysts' expectations for blood sugar control. (not investment advice)</p>
