          <p>The Archdiocese of New Orleans has reached a settlement agreement to pay nearly $180 million to victims of clergy sexual assault.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's war economy is showing signs of strain due to international sanctions, high inflation, and rising production costs, which may eventually force Moscow to negotiate with Ukraine. Military equipment stockpiles are dwindling, and further offensives into 2026 would require politically and economically challenging forced mobilization. While Russia's central bank is trying to curb inflation by maintaining high interest rates, a marked slowdown in GDP growth has surprised economists. Tighter sanctions on Russia's "shadow fleet" and declining oil prices are also impacting revenue, leading to lowered economic growth forecasts and increased budget deficit estimates.</p>

          <p>A landmark review in the UK suggests releasing violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving only a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community and using shorter custodial sentences only in exceptional circumstances. The report also calls for increased funding for the Probation Service and greater use of electronic monitoring. However, concerns are rising among probation staff about being overburdened, and some worry about the impact on public safety.</p>

Labour sources say the last Conservative government failed to agree to a deal regarding the military base on Diego Garcia, while the sentencing review highlights the lack of prison places.

          <p>Senate Republicans are attempting to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers granted to California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue they have the authority to overturn the waivers under the Congressional Review Act, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board asserts that the state will sue if the waivers are revoked, as it impacts numerous other states that have adopted California's standards.</p>

Such an event could sink coastal land by as much as 6.5 feet and unleash waves reaching extreme heights, posing significant risks to cities like Seattle and Portland.

          <p>The Republican-controlled House is attempting to pass President Trump’s tax and spending bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts, creates new breaks, ends green-energy subsidies, and boosts spending on the military and immigration enforcement. It pays for these changes by tightening eligibility for food and health programs for low-income Americans. The bill has faced deep divisions within the Republican party, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add $3.8 trillion to the US’s debt over the next decade. Democrats are strongly opposed to the legislation.</p>

          <p>A bill introduced in the House of Representatives proposes giving newborns $1,000 in accounts named after President Trump. Under the bill, children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. The bill has puzzled tax experts because gains in the accounts would be taxed when money was withdrawn, making them function much like a typical investment account.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, which Ramaphosa and a South African court have denied. Trump's advisor, Elon Musk, has voiced Trump's allegations that white South Africans are fleeing the country due to "violence and racist laws."  A South African court ruled that claims of white genocide were unfounded. There is a problem with farmers being murdered in South Africa, but there is no indication that these murders are race-driven.</p>
