          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was reportedly a doomsday ‚Äúprepper‚Äù who had instructed his family to prepare for war, according to court filings. Boelter is accused of fatally shooting Democratic state house speaker emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Boelter's wife informed investigators that he had recently sent a message to their children instructing them to prepare for war and leave the house, fearing armed individuals might appear. The affidavit does not imply that Boelter‚Äôs wife knew about her husband‚Äôs alleged plans to attack the lawmakers, and she has not been charged with any crime.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative," marking the 48th blood group system recognized worldwide. The discovery occurred 15 years after the woman's blood sample was collected for routine surgery tests, and the unusual antibody was detected in 2011. High-throughput DNA sequencing in 2019 revealed a genetic mutation, making the woman the only known carrier compatible with herself. Researchers hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicates that the pilot of a small plane that crashed in North Carolina attempted to avoid a turtle on the runway before the accident. The pilot reportedly raised a wheel after landing to avoid hitting the turtle, leading to the crash that killed the pilot and a passenger, and seriously injured another passenger. Witnesses reported seeing the pilot raise the right wheel, causing the plane to rock and take off again before crashing in a wooded area near Sugar Valley Airport.

          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts are raising concerns about the effectiveness of US sunscreens compared to those available in other countries. While American sunscreens generally provide good protection against UVB rays, they often offer weaker protection against UVA rays due to regulatory differences. The FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years, while countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients. Dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>The war between Israel and Iran entered its ninth day with continued missile attacks and failed diplomatic talks. Iran reported that Israeli strikes hit multiple cities, including Isfahan, targeting a nuclear site, while Israel confirmed targeting centrifuge production facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned against U.S. involvement in the conflict. The human toll continued to rise, with reports of hundreds of civilian deaths in Iran and dozens in Israel, and the conflict shows no signs of abating.</p>
