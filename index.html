          <p>An 8.7 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has generated tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that waves could reach up to 10 feet in some coastal areas, prompting urgent calls for evacuation to protect lives and property. Russian authorities reported power outages and residents fleeing their homes near the epicenter, while Japanese officials prepared for the initial waves to arrive. The event highlights the seismic volatility of the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area prone to significant geological activity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, to a lifetime position on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 50-49 vote proceeded along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats in opposition due to significant controversy surrounding the nominee. Bove faced multiple whistleblower allegations of misconduct during his time at the Justice Department, including claims that he suggested ignoring court orders and engaged in politically motivated firings. Despite protests from Democrats and calls for further investigation, his nomination was advanced and ultimately approved.</p>

          <p>Police in Norwood, Massachusetts, have arrested six women from Maryland, alleging they are part of an organized criminal group responsible for burglaries across multiple states. The arrests occurred after the women were confronted by homeowners during a break-in and subsequently fled. Following a car and foot chase, all six suspects were apprehended by law enforcement. An investigation revealed that the women were related and several had outstanding warrants for similar crimes in other states. Three of the women have since been taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

          <p>People suffering from compulsive buying disorder, or oniomania, are urging that the condition be treated more seriously by the public and medical community. This article profiles several individuals, including one who accumulated £12,000 in debt buying clothes and another who stockpiled thousands of household items. Sufferers describe the addiction as an overwhelming cycle of seeking a brief emotional high followed by guilt and shame, often exacerbated by social media and online advertising. Experts note that while shopping addiction is not yet a formal diagnosis, they are seeing more cases and believe more support is needed.</p>

          <p>China's foreign ministry has criticized Japan's new space defense guidelines, alleging they are a pretext for developing space weapons and expanding military cooperation with the United States. A Chinese spokesperson claimed these actions threaten the security of outer space and raise concerns about a revival of militarism in the region. The Japanese guidelines identified China and Russia as actively developing anti-satellite technologies, thereby increasing risks in space. This diplomatic friction comes as the U.S. and Japan enhance their collaboration on space-based surveillance and intelligence sharing.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since early 2021 and below economists' expectations. This figure brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range, strengthening the argument for a potential interest rate cut. The slowdown was attributed to a fall in transport costs, which offset rises in housing and food. While the RBA has held its rate steady recently to ensure inflation remains contained, analysts now see this data as sufficient evidence for a rate reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

The culled animals were subsequently fed to the zoo's predators.

          <h2>UK Announces Intent to Recognize Palestinian Statehood to Advance Peace Process</h2>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that the United Kingdom will recognize a Palestinian state by September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the conflict in Gaza. The move is framed as a contribution to a viable two-state solution, which Starmer said is currently under threat. Conditions for avoiding this recognition include Israel agreeing to a ceasefire, allowing substantial humanitarian aid into Gaza, and halting any annexation in the West Bank. The Israeli government condemned the announcement, stating that it rewards terrorism and undermines efforts to release hostages.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of economists and fund managers shows a tight three-way race for who will next lead the Federal Reserve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are tied as the top picks, each with 24% of the vote, to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Kevin Hassett, a presidential economic advisor, follows closely behind at 22%. The survey reflects ongoing speculation about the central bank's leadership, as President Trump has been a frequent critic of Powell's policies, though most respondents believe Powell will not be fired before his term ends.

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force amid reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may disband it. The independent panel of medical experts provides evidence-based recommendations for preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which insurers are required to cover under the Affordable Care Act. The resolution emphasizes the task force's critical role in American healthcare and calls for its work to continue without political interruption. Lawmakers are aiming to apply pressure on the administration to preserve the body, which they argue is essential for public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An eye doctor is issuing a strong warning about the dangers of sleeping with contact lenses, describing the habit as a "game of Russian roulette" for your vision. Dr. Amanda Redfern, an ophthalmologist, explains that sleeping in contacts, even for a nap, can trap bacteria and lead to a corneal ulcer, a severe infection. In the worst cases, this can result in permanent vision loss or even the loss of the eye itself. She also advises against any non-sterile exposure, such as showering with contacts in or using tap water for rinsing, emphasizing that eye health requires careful hygiene.</p>

          <p>The gunman responsible for killing four people in a Manhattan skyscraper reportedly believed he was suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease. A note found at the scene indicated he played high school football and blamed the NFL for concealing the dangers of the sport, requesting his brain be studied for the condition. CTE is linked to repeated head trauma and can lead to mood swings and dementia, but can only be diagnosed posthumously. This potential motive connects the violent act to the broader national conversation about the long-term neurological risks associated with contact sports.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is once again home to Tasmanian devils. Two males, named Danny Zuko and Crush, have arrived from a conservation organization in Australia and are now available for public viewing.

The species is currently classified as endangered due to threats including a contagious facial tumor disease, making their presence at the zoo an important part of conservation and public education efforts.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy from South Carolina who died from a brain-eating amoeba, are speaking out to raise awareness of the rare but deadly infection. The infection, caused by the Naegleria fowleri organism, occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose. His family stated that they were unaware of the risks of swimming in the lake where he was infected and do not want his death to be in vain. Health officials recommend holding one's nose or using nose clips when jumping into freshwater to reduce the risk of this tragic outcome.</p>

          <p>The L.A. County Board of Supervisors has voted to draft a rule that would prohibit law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters. The move responds to recent widespread immigration raids where armed federal agents have apprehended people while their faces and badges were covered. While the Sheriff's Department already has policies requiring identification, the new rule aims to extend this to federal agents operating in unincorporated areas of the county. Officials anticipate a legal challenge from the federal government but expressed readiness to defend the ordinance in court.</p>

          <p>The EPA's proposal to repeal its finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health could set the stage for a legal and regulatory battle led by California. While the federal move aims to dismantle nationwide climate regulations, experts suggest it might inadvertently strengthen states' authority to enact their own stricter rules. California has a long history of pioneering environmental legislation that predates the federal finding, such as its mandates for renewable energy and vehicle emissions reductions. State officials have affirmed their commitment to these climate goals, potentially setting a precedent for other states in the face of federal deregulation.</p>

The bank is considering moving away from featuring historical figures to new themes like nature, innovation, or architecture. Among the ideas submitted were designs featuring the Angel of the North sculpture and the Sycamore Gap tree, with significant engagement from young people despite their lower use of cash. The strong public response demonstrates the cultural importance of banknotes as a way to celebrate the United Kingdom's heritage and achievements.</p>
