          <p>A major manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda. Governor Greg Gianforte has freed up state resources, including the National Guard, to assist over three dozen law enforcement agencies in the search, which he called the state's highest priority. The suspect, who family members say has a history of mental illness, is considered armed and extremely dangerous, putting the small mountain community on high alert. Authorities are using canine units and drones in a large forested area where the suspect is believed to be hiding.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has concluded its investigation into Sentebale, a charity co-founded by Prince Harry, finding no evidence of systemic bullying or misogyny as alleged. However, the regulator criticized all parties involved for allowing a damaging internal dispute to become public, which harmed the charity's reputation. While no sanctions were imposed and the current leadership will remain, the commission issued a regulatory action plan to address governance weaknesses. A spokesman for Prince Harry expressed disappointment that the report did not hold the current chair accountable for her actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deporting migrants under a Trump administration asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing the border illegally, but the court found it could not completely override laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face torture or persecution. This change reopens access to humanitarian protections, though migrants will likely remain detained during processing. The administration may still appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, seeking to reinstate the controversial ban.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are turning to AI-powered chatbots for companionship to combat social isolation. For retirees like 75-year-old Jill Smola, who lives alone and has limited mobility, a chatbot named ElliQ provides hours of daily interaction, from playing games to "visiting" new places. While some ethicists express concern that reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation, users report that the technology provides a meaningful connection. The trend highlights a technological approach to addressing the widespread issue of loneliness among the elderly population.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office, calling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny a quorum and block a Republican-led vote on a controversial redistricting plan. Abbott argues their absence constitutes an abandonment of office, while Wu contends he is fulfilling his constitutional duty by refusing to participate in a "racist gerrymandered map." This legal action marks a significant escalation in the political standoff over Texas's congressional districts.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers after agreeing to a one-year, $8.52 million contract. Allen, who is second in the franchise's all-time receiving yards, was traded to the Chicago Bears last year in a salary-cap move. His return addresses a need for the Chargers, especially after the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams. The six-time Pro Bowl selection will rejoin quarterback Justin Herbert and is expected to provide experience to a receiving corps that includes younger players.</p>

Maxwell, who is appealing her sex trafficking conviction, requested the interview herself, fueling speculation about a potential pardon. Trump has stated he was unaware of Maxwell's recent prison transfer but that the interview conducted by his deputy attorney general was "totally above board."</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues to significantly overstate its cost-cutting achievements. A review of three major contract cancellations from the Department of Health and Human Services shows claimed savings of $6.4 billion, while the actual unspent funds were only about $165 million. Critics argue that DOGE is claiming savings on funds that were never likely to be spent, describing the initiative as "transparency theater." The agency's total claimed savings of $199 billion are also under scrutiny, with little documentation for about half that amount.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible was "preventable" and resulted from a "toxic" safety culture at its parent company, OceanGate. The 300-page report states the company used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to avoid scrutiny of its experimental vessel design. Investigators found that OceanGate ignored warnings and continued to use the submersible despite prior incidents that likely compromised the hull's integrity. The report largely blames co-founder Stockton Rush, stating his overconfidence led to an environment where critical safety concerns were dismissed.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in flea-borne typhus infections, particularly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The disease is spread to humans through the feces of infected fleas, which are often carried by rats, opossums, and stray cats. Symptoms include fever, headache, and a rash, and while deaths are rare, hospitalizations are common.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has decided not to seek the death penalty against three high-profile alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, making the decision particularly notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment. The move comes as a surprise, as Mexico typically requires assurances against the death penalty for extraditions, but these cases involved unusual circumstances.

Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated the models had medical certificates confirming their good health.

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated as Republican Senator John Cornyn requested FBI assistance in locating and arresting the Democratic state lawmakers who fled to block a redistricting vote. This move aims to bring the lawmakers back to Texas, where they face civil arrest warrants signed by the House Speaker. The Democrats, many of whom are in Illinois, left the state to deny a quorum and prevent a Republican-backed plan to redraw congressional maps. The request for federal involvement signals a significant and potentially confrontational escalation in the partisan battle.</p>

          <p>An attorney for Sean "Diddy" Combs has confirmed that "conversations" have taken place with the Trump administration about a potential presidential pardon for the music mogul. Last month, Combs was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation for prostitution, though he was acquitted of more serious racketeering and sex trafficking counts. President Trump has previously appeared open to the idea but also noted Combs' past hostile remarks about him, suggesting it could make a pardon more difficult. Combs' legal team says he remains hopeful about his chances for clemency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to cancel approximately $7 billion in grant funding that has already been awarded to states and other entities for the Solar for All program. This program, a legacy of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels. The move represents the administration's latest effort to undermine renewable energy initiatives. Because the funds have already been awarded, terminating the grants is a complex process that is expected to face significant legal challenges from the recipient states and organizations.</p>

Attorney John Manly, who is not part of the settlement, argues that despite the massive payout, there has been no criminal accountability for the systemic abuse, which he compared to "Epstein Island."
