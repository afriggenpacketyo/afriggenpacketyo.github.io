        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England staged a remarkable comeback led by Jamie Smith's incredible 184-run innings and a 303-run partnership with Harry Brook, who scored 158. Despite their efforts, England was all out for 407 after a late collapse, giving India a significant first-innings lead of 180. India's Mohammed Siraj was instrumental, taking six wickets for 70 runs. By the end of day three, India extended their overall lead to 244, placing them in a commanding position to level the series, though England's reputation for strong run-chases keeps the final outcome uncertain.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks shares dietary advice for parents, emphasizing the link between childhood eating habits and adult chronic illness. He advises against feeding children microwave popcorn, flavored yogurts, processed meats, sugary cereals, and deep-fried foods due to harmful chemicals, excessive sugars, and unhealthy fats. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean unprocessed proteins, and nutrient-dense breakfasts. The article stresses that making small, consistent, and healthier food choices is key to fostering long-term well-being.</p>

          <p>The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Cannes showcased the blockchain's increasing integration into mainstream finance, with major institutions building on its infrastructure. Conversations focused less on token prices and more on Ethereum's utility as the backbone for Wall Street's future, highlighted by Robinhood's launch of tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network. Despite market volatility, institutional players like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are adopting Ethereum for its stability, security, and dependability, signaling a shift from speculative hype to long-term infrastructural value.

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Donald Trump proposed holding a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds as part of the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the United States next year. He suggested that an octagon could be built to accommodate 20,000 to 25,000 spectators for a full championship event on July 4th. Trump mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a supporter of the president, would be involved in organizing the proposed event. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event is hosted at the White House.</p>

          <p>Health experts are detailing the potential physiological impacts of competitive eating, a sport with largely unknown long-term consequences. Gastroenterologists suggest that repeatedly consuming massive quantities of food, such as in the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, can permanently stretch the stomach and impair its ability to contract and empty properly. Short-term effects include gastrointestinal distress, while long-term risks involve complications from ingesting extreme levels of sodium and fat, potentially leading to high blood pressure. While the body can regulate after a single event, the practice carries dangers like choking and esophageal tears.</p>

          <p>Immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are raising alarms over what they describe as widespread racial profiling by immigration agents in Southern California. A new ACLU class-action lawsuit alleges that agents are unconstitutionally targeting people based on their appearance and location, such as Latino-heavy work sites, often detaining individuals without establishing reasonable suspicion. The Department of Homeland Security denies these claims, insisting its operations are highly targeted. However, videos and witness accounts suggest agents are rounding up individuals who appear to be Hispanic, including U.S. citizens, raising serious legal and constitutional questions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign his major policy bill, which narrowly passed Congress, enacting key agenda items like extending tax cuts, increasing defense spending, and funding an immigration crackdown. The legislation also includes significant cuts to Medicaid and new tax breaks on certain incomes. While the administration touts the bill as a catalyst for economic growth, it has faced strong opposition from Democrats and some Republicans over its potential to increase the national debt and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Polling suggests many Americans remain skeptical of the package's overall impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has committed to a massive increase in defense spending to make its armed forces "ready for war," a move hailed by the arms industry as a major economic stimulus. However, economists are skeptical, with one study suggesting the economic return will be moderate, generating only 50 cents of economic activity for every euro spent. Unlike investments in infrastructure or education, military hardware does not create additional economic value once produced. Critics warn that the spending spree may primarily boost arms companies' profits rather than Germany's overall defense capabilities or economic health. (not investment advice)</p>
