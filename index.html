          <p>A driver deliberately rammed a car into a crowd of people outside the Vermont Hollywood nightclub in Los Angeles, injuring thirty individuals, with seven reported in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after a fight reportedly broke out. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him; he was also shot by an unknown assailant who then fled the scene. Police are investigating the crash as an intentional act and are searching for the person who shot the driver.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the Biscailuz Training Center in Monterey Park has killed three deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's arson and explosives detail. This marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. According to sources, the explosion may have been caused by an explosive device that was brought back from a call and believed to be inert. The investigation is ongoing, but authorities have stated there is no broader threat to the public. The deceased deputies were identified as experienced members of the specialized unit.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street Journal article detailing an alleged 2003 letter from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein has unexpectedly shifted sentiment among his base. Many supporters, previously critical of his administration's handling of the Epstein files, are now defending him and directing their anger toward the media. This shift was further solidified by Trump's announcement that he has requested the release of grand jury testimony related to the case. The article suggests this has unified the MAGA movement against a common adversary, though it remains uncertain if this support will last.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, the British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 World Championships has been awarded their gold medals. The ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting. The team was upgraded from silver after the winning U.S. team was disqualified due to a 2008 doping confession from team member Antonio Pettigrew.

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly revoked the visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges, escalating a diplomatic conflict over the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. This action, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is seen as part of a campaign to support Bolsonaro, who faces charges for an alleged coup attempt. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the move as "unacceptable interference" and an affront to Brazil's sovereignty. The move follows an earlier U.S. threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.</p>

The article connects this trend to the "Make America Healthy Again" movement and figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who question the consensus on sun avoidance and sunscreen. This new "sun worship" is fueled by alternative-health influencers and conspiracy theories claiming that public health institutions are suppressing the natural benefits of sunlight.
