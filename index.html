          <p>Mikie Sherrill, a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, has secured the Democratic nomination for governor in New Jersey, triumphing over a competitive field of candidates. Sherrill's campaign emphasized her background and her criticisms of Donald Trump, resonating with voters seeking a fresh perspective. She will now face Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli in the November general election, as Democrats aim to retain the governorship for a third consecutive term. Sherrill's victory marks a significant moment for the party as they seek a strong leader and a message that appeals to a broad electorate, particularly in light of the state's shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of violent disorder as petrol bombs, fireworks, and other projectiles were thrown at police, leading to the use of baton rounds and water cannons to disperse protesters.

Homes and businesses were attacked, with some residents displaying signs indicating the nationalities of those inside, highlighting the escalating tensions.

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area to support National Guard troops responding to protests over federal immigration enforcement, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to file a lawsuit seeking to block their deployment. The state argues that the presence of soldiers on city streets causes irreparable damage and that federal troops should only protect federal property and personnel. The Trump administration defends the deployment as necessary to protect ICE agents from violence, while local officials criticize the move as an escalation of tensions.

          <p>Argentina's Supreme Court has upheld the corruption conviction of former President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, sentencing her to six years in prison and permanently banning her from holding public office. The conviction stems from a case in 2022 where she was found guilty of steering public works contracts to a friend's construction company during her presidency. Kirchner, who served as vice president until recently, denounced the ruling as politically motivated, while President Milei applauded the verdict. Due to her age, Kirchner is likely to serve her sentence under house arrest.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs can remain in effect until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that had blocked them. The decision extends a legal battle over the legality of the tariffs, which were imposed on imports from various countries, including Canada, China, and Mexico. The Trump administration argues that the tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances and restore U.S. manufacturing, while opponents contend that they lack legal authority and harm businesses and consumers. The court has scheduled oral arguments for July 31, further delaying the resolution of the dispute.</p>

          <p>Authorities are tracking a lone hiker believed to be Travis Caleb Decker, the father accused of killing his three daughters, near a mountain pass in the Wenatchee Mountains of Washington state. Decker is charged with murder and kidnapping after his daughters were found dead last week, and authorities have been searching for him since May 30. Tracking teams spotted a solo hiker matching Decker's description who fled when a helicopter approached, leading to an intensified search effort involving K-9 units. The case has garnered national attention, with authorities urging residents to secure their homes and report any suspicious activity.</p>

Coca-Cola's shares are fully priced, with high price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios, and a low dividend yield. PepsiCo has a lower price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios than Coca-Cola, and its yield is toward the high end of its historical range, making it look cheap. PepsiCo also operates in the salty snack and packaged foods spaces, giving it more ways to support long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UN panel is urging the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius while allowing the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return, calling for a suspension of the current deal and negotiation of a new agreement. The Foreign Office maintains that the deal has been welcomed by international organizations.</p>

The raids have prompted workers to flee fields and raise concerns about the safety and well-being of undocumented immigrants, who make up a significant portion of the state's agricultural workforce.

Candidates on both sides of the aisle vowed to tackle pocketbook issues, from high property taxes to grocery prices, to housing and health care costs.

          <p>President Trump delivered a speech at Fort Bragg, continuing his attacks on American military traditions by mocking political rivals and encouraging military personnel to jeer at the press. He elicited cheers by announcing plans to rename U.S. bases after Confederate traitors and repeated his narrative about an invasion of America by foreign criminals. This behavior violates regulations prohibiting active-duty military members from attending political rallies in uniform or expressing partisan views. The author questions the silence of senior military officers, urging them to defend the Army and the other services from Trump's actions, which undermine the integrity of the troops and the values of the U.S. military.</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and the protection of playtime during school breaks to encourage children to spend less time on screens. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that outdoor play in England has significantly declined due to various factors, including traffic, crime, and unwelcome public spaces. The commission is calling for a national Play Strategy for England, with recommendations including updating planning policies, protecting play in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community. The goal is to reverse the growing culture of intolerance towards children playing outdoors.</p>
