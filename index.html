          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, bringing the total rate to 50% in response to India's continued purchasing of Russian oil. This move, set to take effect in 21 days, has been labeled "unfair" by India's foreign ministry, which argues its Russian oil imports began after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The tariffs are expected to severely impact key Indian export sectors like textiles and auto parts, potentially cutting US-bound exports by up to 50%. The action signals a hardline stance on sanctions enforcement, even against strategic partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, a collection of photographs contrasts the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 with their vibrant, rebuilt state today. The article recounts the immediate destruction, which killed approximately 210,000 people by the end of that year, and the long-term suffering from radiation. Survivors' testimonies and historical images of the ruined cities are juxtaposed with pictures of the modern metropolises they have become. The piece also reflects on the current global landscape, with nine nuclear-armed nations and rising geopolitical tensions, underscoring the enduring call for peace from the two cities that experienced nuclear attacks.</p>

          <p>Free agent safety Tracy Walker has been suspended by the NFL for 12 games, a significant penalty that will keep him off the field for most of the upcoming season. The specific reason for the massive suspension has not been publicly disclosed by the league. Walker, 30, was a third-round pick in 2018 and spent six seasons with the Detroit Lions, where he was a notable contributor to their defense. This suspension will likely complicate his efforts to sign with a new team, as he will not be eligible to play until Week 13 of the 2025 season.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the termination of approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The canceled projects, primarily targeting COVID-19 and influenza, were deemed by HHS to pose "more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses." The decision has drawn sharp criticism from public health experts and former officials, who argue that defunding this proven technology will cost lives and leave the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics. Kennedy stated the funds would be redirected to what he described as "safer, broader vaccine platforms."</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the White House, Apple has committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. The announcement, celebrated by President Trump, is seen as a move by Apple to avoid potential tariffs that would raise costs on its internationally sourced components. CEO Tim Cook stated the investment includes expanding work with 10 U.S. companies that produce components for Apple products. This development occurs as the administration intensifies its trade-war tactics, including recently doubling tariffs on India for its trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concern over the latest U.S. jobs report, noting that significant downward revisions to May and June's hiring data are often "typical of turning points" in the economy. The July report showed weaker-than-expected job growth, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised previous months' figures down by a combined 258,000 jobs. Cook suggested these revisions could signal a coming economic slowdown and that businesses are already feeling an "uncertainty tax" due to unpredictable trade policies. Her comments provide a cautious economic outlook from a key figure at the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner is based on a factually incorrect timeline of events regarding jobs report revisions. The President claimed that strong jobs numbers were released just before the 2024 election and then revised sharply downward afterward, but the opposite occurred. A major downward revision of 818,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, two months before the election. Furthermore, the final report before the election, released on November 1, showed a dramatic slowdown in hiring. This analysis highlights the discrepancy between the administration's claims of political manipulation and the actual release schedule of the economic data.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could result in a significant economic blow to India, particularly in key export sectors. While only about 20% of India's goods exports go to the U.S., industries like gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles are highly exposed, with an estimated $8 billion in exports vulnerable. However, analysts suggest that some of India's largest export categories to the U.S., such as IT services and pharmaceuticals, are not targeted by the new duties on goods, which may insulate the broader Indian economy and its stock market from the most severe impacts.

This informal community, which may have also attracted others seeking shelter, appears to have persisted until the 5th century.

          <p>A Jefferson County District Attorney has concluded that a Homewood police officer was justified in fatally shooting 18-year-old Jabari Peoples in the back, and no charges will be filed. The DA's report states the shooting occurred after Peoples struggled with an officer, ran back to his car, and grabbed a gun from the door. However, the teen's family, who were shown a brief and unclear portion of the body camera footage, questions this conclusion. They state Peoples was scared and running for his life, and their attorney is calling for the full, unedited video to be released to the public for transparency.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins, the co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of Paramount Pictures, has resigned from his position. The move was anticipated, as it comes just one day before David Ellison’s Skydance Media is set to finalize its $8.4 billion takeover of the historic entertainment company. Robbins, who has led the film studio since 2021, was part of a three-person leadership team that steered the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and ownership uncertainty. Following the merger, the studio will be jointly managed by longtime Skydance executives Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, marking a significant leadership change for the famed studio.</p>

          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace has priced its initial public offering at $45 per share, exceeding its revised target range of $41 to $43. The offering raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion. The successful IPO reflects growing investor interest in the space technology sector, which has seen several companies go public recently. Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors, and successfully landed its Blue Ghost lander on the moon earlier this year, positioning it as a key player in the commercial space industry.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's frequent claims of a "rigged" system are a form of political projection, accusing others of the actions he himself undertakes. The author points to several examples, including the firing of the BLS commissioner over unfavorable jobs numbers and the push for mid-decade congressional redistricting in Texas to favor Republicans. The piece contends that these actions, from influencing economic data to redrawing electoral maps, represent a pattern of attempting to manipulate governmental processes for political gain. The author concludes that while the President decries rigging, his administration is actively engaged in it across multiple fronts.</p>

Pawol, a former collegiate softball player, began her professional umpiring career in the minor leagues in 2016 after attending MLB's umpire development camps. Her promotion to the major leagues is a landmark moment for baseball, breaking a long-standing gender barrier for on-field officials in the sport and setting a powerful example for aspiring female umpires.</p>

With England needing 17 runs to win, Woakes emerged at number 11 with his arm in a sling, attempting to help his team secure a victory. Although he did not face a ball, he managed to run four times before his partner was bowled, resulting in a narrow six-run loss for England. Woakes, who had to practice batting left-handed to protect his injury, said he felt a duty to his team and has been widely praised for his courage.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County may be far higher than official counts. A study published in a medical journal estimates there were 440 more deaths than normally expected during the period of the fires, compared to the 31 deaths directly attributed by the coroner. Researchers argue that official numbers often miss fatalities caused by indirect effects like poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services. This modeling effort highlights the hidden public health burden of climate-driven disasters, which can have lingering and hard-to-quantify consequences long after the flames are extinguished.</p>
