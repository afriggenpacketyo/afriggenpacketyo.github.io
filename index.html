          <p>China's state media has hinted at the imminent commissioning of its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, through social media images showing 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, surpassing the capacity of the country's existing carriers. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggests the new markings indicate the Fujian is preparing for commissioning and will undergo trial service to test adaptability and coordination with aircraft and weapon systems. Additional sea trials may occur before the formal commissioning by the end of the year, focusing on take-off and landing tests, and carrier group coordination exercises, ensuring the Fujian's readiness for naval operations. This represents a significant advancement in China's naval capabilities and strategic presence in the region. Optimism regarding China's military modernization is cautiously measured given geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County, California, battled two brush fires on Monday night. The Howe fire, the larger of the two, had burned approximately 40 acres in steep terrain south of Piru, with helicopters making water drops on the flames. Air tankers and additional helicopters were called in, with 140 firefighters on the scene or en route, as mild winds were expected to carry smoke eastward. Simultaneously, about 16 miles southwest, firefighters contained the Maria fire, which had burned about 15 acres south of Santa Paula, involving 140 firefighters, three helicopters, and one dozer, with crews continuing clean-up operations into the evening.</p>

          <p>Televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, 90, is in critical condition after experiencing cardiac arrest at his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His son, Donnie Swaggart, reported that he and his brother administered chest compressions before EMTs arrived, reviving his heartbeat before transporting him to the ICU. Jimmy Swaggart is known for founding Jimmy Swaggart Ministries and the Family Worship Center, and he gained notoriety in 1988 for a scandal involving a sex worker, which led to his defrocking by the Assemblies of God, though he continued to preach. Despite his past controversies, Swaggart remains a prominent figure in televangelism and gospel music, and his family continues to lead services at the Family Worship Center.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City police are investigating two self-described "peacekeepers" following a fatal shooting at a "No Kings Day" protest that resulted in one death and another injury. The incident occurred when the peacekeepers confronted 24-year-old Arturo Roberto Gamboa, who allegedly brandished a rifle near the crowd; one of the peacekeepers opened fire, hitting Gamboa and 39-year-old Arthur Folasa "Afa" Ah Loo, who died. Police say there was no record of organized security in the event's permit, and they are determining if the use of deadly force was lawful under Utah law, while Gamboa has been booked into jail for investigation of murder, though he did not fire any shots. The protest was part of nationwide demonstrations, and Utah's governor has called the shooting a deeply troubling act of violence.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democracies convened to discuss global trade amidst tensions stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral actions. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the importance of cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world, though Trump reiterated his desire to potentially include China in the group, while also addressing the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressed the need for the G7 to unite in building a free, fair, and rules-based economic order, advocating for the reinforcement of the multilateral free trade regime with the World Trade Organization at its core. The summit will feature discussions on regional affairs and the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, with a focus on maintaining stability amid China's increasing military activity.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix experienced significant gains, reaching over two-decade highs, following reports that SK Group plans to construct the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has seen its shares surge nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom, with SK Telecom and SK Broadband reportedly leading the data center initiative. While competitor Samsung also saw gains, its growth has lagged behind SK Hynix, which has become a leader in high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence servers, supplying to clients like Nvidia. The market's positive reaction reflects confidence in SK Hynix's position in the rapidly expanding AI sector.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump made limited progress in resolving tariff disputes during their summit, raising doubts about the potential for a quick, mutually beneficial agreement that would protect Japan's auto sector. Ishiba emphasized that any deal should serve the interests of both countries, and ministerial talks will continue to seek such an agreement, despite Trump's imposition of tariffs on various goods. Japan is urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy, particularly the 25 percent tariff on autos, a critical sector for the Japanese economy, though Japanese automakers have been increasing investments and production in the U.S. Despite the uncertain outlook, Ishiba stated that Japan would not rush into a deal that compromises national interests.</p>

Ohtani pitched one inning against the San Diego Padres, allowing one run on two hits, while also serving as the team's leadoff hitter. The Dodgers had initially planned to delay Ohtani's pitching return, but his impressive progress during batting practice and concerns about the taxing nature of simulated sessions led to an expedited timeline. The team plans to gradually increase his workload, with Ohtani likely serving as an opener once per week, building up to more innings as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs, Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy, proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent the investigation, arrest, prosecution, or imprisonment of women who terminate their own pregnancies, arguing that such investigations are dehumanizing and prolonged. Her proposal maintains punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside existing law, receiving backing from 176 MPs and main abortion providers. The current law in England and Wales allows abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and beyond in certain circumstances, requiring approval from two doctors.</p>

Over 140,000 older Americans are homeless on any given day, a figure projected to triple by 2030, often due to factors like the death of a spouse, job loss, or medical issues. Many lack health insurance and face complex chronic medical conditions, leading to high rates of hospitalization and difficulties in finding stable housing. Experts emphasize the need for continued funding for programs like Medicaid to prevent further hardship for seniors, as many find themselves in unexpected circumstances during what should be their retirement years.</p>

The survey also suggests that nearly 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, prompting calls for the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which would ban marketing and sales to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are small, tobacco-free rectangles containing nicotine powder, and while less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and unregulated, raising concerns about their accessibility to children. The survey also found an increase in adult usage, particularly among young men, highlighting the need for greater regulation and awareness of the potential health implications.</p>

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on arms exports to deepen ties with allies and strengthen its defense industrial base. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba have signaled a shift in arms policy, aiming to enhance interoperability with partners by standardizing maintenance processes and creating joint training opportunities. This move is driven by security concerns and the need to develop a viable domestic defense industry, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapon purchases. While Japan's current arms exports are minimal compared to countries like South Korea and China, building domestic capacity is seen as crucial for ensuring its security and reducing dependence on the U.S.</p>

The fitness of Jasprit Bumrah, arguably the world's best fast bowler, is a major concern, and the team's performance will depend on its ability to adapt to seaming conditions and overcome historical imbalances.

The decision follows a series of developments in the conflict, including Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile strikes, with Trump warning residents of Tehran to evacuate immediately. Trump's early departure disrupts G7 discussions on the Middle East and efforts to issue a joint statement calling for de-escalation, as the U.S. has not been directly involved but has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group to the region. The rapid escalation has raised concerns about potential U.S. involvement and the risk of a broader war in the region.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's megabill to fund his second-term agenda is setting up a potential clash with the House, as key Senate Republicans raise concerns about the legislation. Differences between the House and Senate versions include disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid provider taxes, and the child tax credit amount. While the Senate bill permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts and includes no tax on tips and overtime, it also proposes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the House's $4 trillion. The differing proposals create challenges for passing the bill by the Republicans' July Fourth deadline.</p>

          <p>In response to immigration raids by masked federal officers, California lawmakers have proposed a bill to ban law enforcement from concealing their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The bill aims to increase transparency and accountability, addressing concerns that current tactics allow ICE agents to appear as local police. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security criticized the proposal, citing safety concerns for officers, while proponents argue that masking faces shields law enforcement from public scrutiny.
