          <p>Microsoft has fired two employees who participated in a protest inside the office of company President Brad Smith. The protest was organized by the group "No Azure for Apartheid," which demands that Microsoft cease its support for Israel amid claims its technology is being used by the Israeli military in Gaza. The company stated the terminations were due to "serious breaches of company policies," including unlawful break-ins. The incident is part of a series of actions by the employee group, which has led to previous arrests and an ongoing FBI investigation into the protests.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and injured over a dozen others. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, a former student, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Evidence, including a manifesto and videos, suggests the attack was extensively planned and motivated by broad hatred, with a specific desire to harm children.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged former Department of Justice employee Sean Charles Dunn with a misdemeanor for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer in Washington, D.C. The charge was reduced after a grand jury declined to indict him on a more serious felony assault charge. This marks the second recent case where the D.C. U.S. Attorney's office has failed to secure a felony indictment for an alleged assault on a federal officer. The incident occurred while federal authorities were deployed in the capital to address what President Trump has described as a major crime problem.</p>

          <p>Florida has set a modern-era record for executions in a single year after carrying out its 11th execution on Thursday. Curtis Windom, 59, was put to death by lethal injection for a 1992 triple murder, following the rejection of his final appeals by both the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts. Windom's attorneys had argued that he received incompetent legal representation during his original trial, but these claims were repeatedly denied by the courts. Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a steady stream of death warrants this year, with a 12th execution already scheduled for September, continuing the state's record-setting pace.</p>

In an exclusive interview, Zhao emphasized that the city's success hinges on the speed at which its regulators adapt and implement favorable policies. He praised the Hong Kong government for showing a clear intent to embrace Web3 technologies but suggested immediate changes are needed.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain faith in strong growth stocks, using Nvidia as a prime example of a company with long-term potential. Despite a recent dip in its stock price following an earnings report, Cramer expressed confidence in the chipmaker's future, citing its dominance in the artificial intelligence sector. He argued that generative AI is still in its early stages and that Nvidia's products are uniquely positioned to revolutionize industries and "reinvent the very concept of work." Cramer suggested that trading in and out of such stocks causes investors to miss out on significant long-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent ousting of CDC Director Susan Monarez is the culmination of months of significant turmoil at the federal health agency under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Since November 2024, the CDC has experienced mass layoffs, the withdrawal of a director nominee, and the resignation of multiple high-level officials. Key events include the replacement of the entire independent vaccine advisory panel and major changes to COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. This period of upheaval reflects a broader conflict over vaccine policy and the scientific independence of the agency.</p>

Officials and parents credit middle schoolers with shielding their younger "buddies" by pushing them under pews and covering them, actions that likely saved numerous lives but resulted in many of the older children sustaining injuries. The school's buddy system, which pairs older students with younger ones for church services, played a crucial role in this protective response. The community is now mourning the two children who were killed while honoring the bravery shown by students and staff.</p>

          <p>According to auto research firm Edmunds, the upcoming Labor Day weekend presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, making this a critical time to act. Leasing has become the dominant way consumers acquire EVs, accounting for 70% of transactions in July, as it allows them to test the technology without committing to a purchase. The IRS has also provided flexibility, allowing consumers to claim the credit if they sign a contract before the deadline, even if the vehicle is delivered later.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans found that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology is a net negative for attracting new customers. The poll, conducted by Slingshot Strategies, revealed that 35% of consumers were less likely to buy a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% were more likely. This sentiment comes as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational challenges, with nearly half of those surveyed believing FSD technology should be illegal. The findings challenge Elon Musk's assertion that autonomous driving is central to the company's future value and suggest a significant market education and trust gap.</p>

U.S. Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that the law requires this oversight to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. Since President Trump has not filled the vacant positions on the panel, Lake lacks the authority to remove Abramowitz.

          <p>This opinion piece discusses Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto's campaign against illegal palm oil plantations, which have led to the destruction of millions of hectares of forest. The author argues that the issue cannot be understood without considering the role of global demand, particularly from markets like China. As Indonesia begins dismantling illegal operations and relocating families, the article posits that consumer countries have a responsibility to promote sustainable practices. The piece suggests that by leveraging its market power, China could play a pivotal role in rewriting the future of the Indonesian palm oil industry towards a more environmentally conscious model.</p>

          <h2>End of 'De Minimis' Import Tax Exemption to Impact Online Shoppers</h2>

          <p>An 86-year-old trade rule known as "de minimis," which allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, is being suspended by a Trump administration executive order. This change will subject all incoming shipments to an import tax, potentially increasing prices for consumers who buy low-cost goods from online retailers like Temu and Shein. The rule's suspension is intended to level the playing field for American businesses and increase oversight of imported goods. For the next six months, a flat tax will apply, after which rates will be based on tariffs for the country of origin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public media stations in rural and tribal areas across the U.S. are warning that tens of millions of dollars in federal funding for emergency alert systems are in jeopardy. The Next Generation Warning System grant program, created by Congress to upgrade critical infrastructure, has been stalled by administrative and political issues. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which administered the grants, has sued FEMA for allegedly withholding funds and is now winding down its operations after its own federal funding was cut. This has left stations with partially completed projects and no guarantee of reimbursement, threatening public safety in communities reliant on their broadcasts.</p>

          <p>All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers following a lengthy and public contract dispute. As part of the deal, Parsons agreed to a record-breaking four-year, $188 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The Cowboys will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark in return. The dispute stemmed from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' refusal to negotiate with Parsons' agent, leading Parsons to formally request a trade and end his highly successful four-year tenure in Dallas.</p>

          <p>Shares of Gap fell after the company reported mixed second-quarter results and warned that increased costs from tariffs will negatively impact its future profits. The apparel retailer raised its estimate for tariff-related costs to between $150 million and $175 million, which is expected to lower its full-year operating margin. While the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands saw positive comparable sales growth, the company's overall performance was dragged down by a 9% decline in sales at its Athleta brand. CEO Richard Dickson acknowledged disappointment with Athleta's performance, calling it a "year of reset" for the activewear line. (not investment advice)</p>

Mr. Merkel also expressed immense gratitude for the heroic actions of other children and adults inside the church, stating their selflessness prevented an even greater tragedy.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced an expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to major cities across the state, including Los Angeles, San Diego, and the Bay Area. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The announcement is seen as a counterpoint to President Trump's narrative about rampant crime in blue states and his use of military forces in cities. Newsom emphasized that his approach involves collaboration with local law enforcement, contrasting it with what he described as the president's confrontational tactics.</p>

          <p>The recent leadership crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine science and public health policy driven by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A longtime vaccine skeptic, Kennedy has initiated sweeping changes, including firing advisory panels and altering immunization guidelines, which critics argue undermines the agency's scientific independence. The firing of Director Susan Monarez and the subsequent resignation of four top officials highlight concerns that political ideology is overriding evidence-based health policy. This turmoil threatens to erode public trust and weaken the nation's ability to respond to health crises.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), was abruptly fired by the Trump administration. Primus stated he learned of his termination after his work phone was locked upon returning from an Amtrak event. The White House said Primus "did not align with the President's America First agenda," while rail worker unions condemned the move, suggesting it was timed to influence the review of a potential merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. This ouster is part of a recent pattern of high-profile firings by the administration, including those at the Federal Reserve and the CDC.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump to block his unprecedented attempt to remove her from office. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud as the "cause" for her removal, which Cook's lawsuit calls "nakedly pretextual" and legally insufficient. The suit argues that allowing the firing would subvert the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to protect the central bank's independence from political pressure. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order, setting the stage for a significant legal battle over presidential power.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is within his constitutional rights to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whether for "cause" or not. The author contends that Article II of the Constitution vests the entire "executive power" in the president, which includes the authority to remove executive branch officers. The piece critiques the concept of "independent" agencies as a fourth branch of government that is unmoore from political accountability. It concludes that for-cause removal restrictions are constitutionally dubious and that the president must be able to fire officials like Fed governors to ensure democratic control over the administrative state.</p>
