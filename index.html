          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana voiced concerns over the Trump administration's deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, against the wishes of her father. Judge Terry A. Doughty questioned the legality and constitutionality of deporting a U.S. citizen, highlighting that the decision seemed to be based solely on the mother's preference. The judge scheduled a hearing to investigate the matter, expressing strong suspicions that the government acted without due process. This case raises serious questions about the rights and protections afforded to U.S. citizens, particularly minors, in immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, known for accusing Prince Andrew and other influential figures of sexual assault as a teenager trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41. Giuffre became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's downfall, having accused him and others of sexually exploiting her when she was underage. Her accusations led to Prince Andrew stepping down from royal duties and settling with Giuffre in 2022, acknowledging Epstein's abuse. Her death highlights the lasting impact of sexual abuse and trafficking on survivors.</p>
