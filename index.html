        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pre-orders for Apple's new iPhone 17 series have shattered previous records in China, demonstrating robust demand despite initial shipment delays for the iPhone Air model. Online platforms like JD.com reported sales surpassing last year's iPhone 16 series within the first minute, with the 256GB iPhone 17 being the most popular variant. Overwhelming customer interest led to difficulties accessing Apple's website and rapid booking of in-person pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai, with some regions facing waiting periods extending to October. This strong performance underscores Apple's enduring appeal and market penetration in the highly competitive Chinese consumer electronics landscape, reflecting consumer eagerness for the latest technology.</p>

          <p>Bavaria's state minister, Hubert Aiwanger, has affirmed the German state's openness to Chinese investment, despite broader European Union concerns about economic resilience and self-sufficiency. Aiwanger emphasized that protectionism and isolationism are not the answer, advocating for continued close relations with major economies like China, the USA, and Japan. This stance echoes a historical visit by a Bavarian politician to Beijing fifty years prior, underscoring a long-standing economic connection between the regions. Bavaria actively welcomes numerous Chinese companies, signaling a pragmatic approach to international trade and investment that prioritizes regional economic benefits while acknowledging wider geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are aggressively expanding into the European market, challenging established legacy automakers on their home turf. At the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, Chinese brands showcased advanced technology and aggressive expansion plans, aiming to introduce mass-market models like Xpeng's Mona series and GAC's Aion EVs. Despite potential EU tariffs, these companies leverage affordability, battery technology, and production scale, leading to a near doubling of their market share in Europe in the first half of the year. European automakers face pressure to innovate faster and scale EV production to compete effectively.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, students from various political backgrounds have expressed a strong resolve to continue the debates he championed. Scott Sperry, a student inspired by Kirk, emphasized that attempts to silence such voices only amplify them, predicting "a million Charlie Kirks." Even those who disagreed with Kirk's views feel a personal responsibility to ensure healthy campus discussions persist. The incident has intensified the political divide, with some students becoming more politically involved and determined to uphold the principles of free speech and open debate on campus.</p>

          <p>Chagas disease, a parasitic infection originating from South America, is increasingly being detected in at least eight US states, prompting health authorities to consider categorizing it as endemic. Transmitted by the "kissing bug" through its feces, the disease can lead to severe complications like heart failure or enlargement of the esophagus and colon years after initial, often asymptomatic, infection. The World Health Organization estimates over seven million people are infected globally, with hundreds of thousands in the US. This reclassification would elevate Chagas from an imported tropical disease to a permanent health risk, necessitating enhanced monitoring, research, and treatment strategies.</p>

This poor performance raises questions about coach DeShaun Foster's second season and the team's ability to secure a victory against a challenging schedule.

An inconsistency in the timeline, with an hour unaccounted for, and Bane's delayed call to the coastguard have raised suspicions. Her family and friends, still seeking answers, want the case reclassified as a no-body murder investigation, especially given Bane's past domestic violence conviction.</p>

Mandelson was subsequently sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US, with Downing Street citing "new information" materially altering the understanding of their relationship. This incident has intensified pressure on Starmer regarding the vetting process for appointments.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya alleges that dozens of political prisoners released by Belarus as part of a US-brokered deal were forcibly deported, not genuinely freed. While acknowledging relief for their freedom, Tsikhanouskaya stated that this was "not real freedom" as many were exiled to Lithuania, separated from families, and without passports. Some prisoners thanked US President Trump for the deal, which also involved lifting sanctions on Belarus' national airline. However, the opposition calls on Western governments to demand that Lukashenko allow political prisoners to remain in their home country, highlighting the complex human rights implications of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated super middleweight clash between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford is set to define their legacies, with both fighters weighing in at 167.5 pounds. Crawford, undefeated and jumping two weight classes, seeks to become the first male three-division undisputed champion, while Álvarez aims to reaffirm his status as a boxing legend. The fight, happening during Mexican Independence Day weekend in Las Vegas, pits Álvarez's power and ring control against Crawford's mobility and tactical intelligence. This crossroads bout, with different backgrounds and styles, is seen as an almost unrepeatable event that will significantly impact their careers and the sport.</p>

          <p>An international team of divers has uncovered the remarkably preserved remnants of an 8,000-year-old Stone Age settlement on the seabed in Denmark's Bay of Aarhus. This discovery, part of a European Union-funded project, offers a unique "time capsule" of coastal life, preserved in an oxygen-free environment after rising sea levels submerged it. Researchers have found animal bones, stone tools, arrowheads, and worked wood, providing valuable insights into how ancient communities adapted to rapidly changing climates. The findings are particularly relevant today, as current sea level rise rates are comparable to those 8,000 years ago, threatening modern coastal populations globally.</p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a Republican-backed plan to redraw the state's congressional maps, aiming to create seven GOP-leaning House districts and potentially add another Republican seat. This mid-decade redistricting effort, supported by former President Trump, mirrors similar moves in other states as Republicans seek to maintain their House majority. The plan, which splits the Kansas City area, making a Democratic district more conservative, faces immediate legal challenges. Opponents, including the ACLU, argue the map is unconstitutional, violates compactness requirements, and racially gerrymanders voters, raising concerns about fairness and the precedent of mid-decade redistricting.</p>

          <p>A Harvard study has found that women who experienced stalking or obtained restraining orders face a significantly higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Analyzing 20 years of data from over 66,000 nurses, researchers found a 41% increased risk for those stalked and a 70% increased risk for those with restraining orders, even after accounting for other health factors. This highlights the profound and lasting health toll of interpersonal violence, extending beyond immediate physical or emotional trauma. The findings suggest doctors should consider incorporating questions about such experiences into routine heart health screenings to improve women's health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Keith Rabois, the newly appointed chairman of Opendoor Technologies, has controversially stated that the company's workforce of 1,400 employees is "bloated," suggesting only 200 are needed. He criticized the company's culture, attributing issues to remote work and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts, vowing a return to "merit and excellence." These remarks follow Opendoor's recent surge as a meme stock and the appointment of a new CEO. Rabois's comments align with a broader trend among tech leaders rolling back remote work and DEI initiatives, potentially signaling significant changes and layoffs for the real estate tech firm.

          <p>Three octogenarian Austrian nuns, Sisters Bernadette, Regina, and Rita, defiantly fled the Catholic care home where they were placed to return to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in Elsbethen. They regained access with the help of former students and a locksmith, asserting their right to live there until the end of their lives, a right they claim was broken. Church authorities, who dissolved their community and deemed the convent rooms unsuitable for care, expressed displeasure. Despite initial lack of utilities, supporters are assisting the nuns, who are determined to stay in their cherished home, sparking a heartwarming human-interest story.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, AI tools like X's Grok chatbot rapidly spread false claims, conspiracy theories, and misidentified suspects, according to a CBS News analysis. Grok generated incorrect suspect identities before official release and created altered "enhancements" of FBI photos, some of which were reposted by law enforcement. The chatbot also produced contradictory information about the suspect's political affiliation and even falsely stated Kirk was alive. Experts highlight that generative AI's probability-based outputs struggle with real-time events, leading to misinformation that users often trust more than human sources, further complicated by potential foreign influence.</p>

          <p>An analysis reveals Charlie Kirk's significant role in Donald Trump's 2024 election victory, particularly by mobilizing younger voters, a demographic traditionally dominated by Democrats. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, successfully persuaded the Republican establishment to invest in youth outreach, contributing to Trump's improved performance with voters under 30. Experts noted Kirk's ability to project strength and masculinity, and his willingness to engage in debates, resonated with young men. His "Ballot Chasers" program in battleground states also helped mobilize low-propensity Trump supporters, demonstrating his instrumental contribution to the campaign's ground game and the broader MAGA coalition.</p>
