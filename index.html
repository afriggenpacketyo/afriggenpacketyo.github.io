          <p>Kohl's Corporation terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan after an external investigation revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest with a vendor, violating the company's ethics code. The investigation found Buchanan directed the company to engage in transactions involving a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship, and he failed to disclose this connection as required. Buchanan must forfeit his equity awards and repay a portion of his signing bonus. Michael Bender, the board chair, has been appointed as interim CEO, and the company stated that the termination was unrelated to Kohl's financial performance or reporting.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has discontinued $1 billion in funding for children's mental health services, reversing a bipartisan measure enacted after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting. The Education Department claims the grants were canceled due to potential violations of federal civil rights law, citing concerns over race-based hiring quotas and diversity training. Senator Christopher Murphy criticized the decision as illegal, while conservative activist Christopher Rufo praised it as ending a "slush fund for activists." The move has sparked debate over the role of diversity initiatives in mental health support for students, with some arguing that culturally competent care is essential for addressing racial stress and trauma.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British veterinary practices may face price caps on medicines, prescriptions, and services like pet cremations, as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigates potential anti-competitive practices. Treatment costs have risen by 60% between 2015 and 2023, outpacing general inflation. The CMA is also considering banning bonuses linked to specific treatments to ensure vets' clinical freedom. Other proposed measures include requiring vets to display prices clearly online and informing owners of cheaper treatment options. The watchdog aims to finalize its decision by November, seeking to increase transparency and affordability in the veterinary sector.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott is threatening to pull state funding from San Marcos over a proposed resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo against Israel. Abbott argues that the resolution is antisemitic and violates a state law prohibiting government entities from supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. City Council member Alyssa Garza defended the resolution as a fight against big government, while another member described the war in Gaza as a "genocide." The City Council is set to vote on the resolution, which could trigger an evaluation of the city's grants by Abbott's office.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams described the BBC's response to his complaint regarding a Spotlight program alleging his involvement in the murder of Denis Donaldson as "insulting." Adams is suing the BBC for damages, claiming the allegation is false and motivated by malice. The BBC defended its journalism as responsible and adhering to editorial guidelines. Adams condemned Donaldson's murder at the time, stating it was carried out by opponents of the peace process, and the Real IRA admitted to the killing in 2009.

          <p>Colleges are increasingly relying on consultants, owned by private equity firms, to attract applicants and calculate financial aid packages, influencing the price families pay. These firms gather extensive data on prospective students to offer targeted discounts, a practice known as "financial aid optimization." The algorithms developed by these consulting firms analyze various factors to predict a student's likelihood of enrolling and their willingness to pay. Some critics argue this system resembles arbitrage, treating financial aid as a commodity. Politicians have also raised concerns about potential algorithmic collusion among schools, as these practices may prioritize revenue over accessibility for lower-income students.</p>

          <p>Fourteen-year-old cricketer Vaibhav Suryavanshi experienced a stark contrast in fortunes, being dismissed for a duck just days after scoring a record-breaking century in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Suryavanshi's dismissal contributed to Rajasthan Royals' collapse, as they were bowled out for 117 in the 17th over, resulting in a 100-run defeat against Mumbai Indians. The win propelled Mumbai to the top of the table, while Rajasthan remained in eighth place.</p>

          <p>A judge dismissed charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, a man accused by the attorney general and FBI director of being a leader of the MS-13 gang, paving the way for his deportation. The Justice Department requested the dismissal, but Villatoro Santos's attorney questioned the lack of explanation and accused the department of circumventing due process. The attorney argued the government wanted to deport him without due process, criticizing the lack of input from the Department of Homeland Security. The case was unusual because charging documents made only a fleeting reference to MS-13.</p>

While longer-term studies are needed, this development is significant as there is currently no FDA-approved treatment for MASH.
