        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Donald Trump indicated a ceasefire is not essential for brokering a peace deal to end the war with Russia. This stance diverges from that of European leaders from Germany and France, who also attended and emphasized that a halt in fighting is a crucial first step. Zelenskyy was present to lobby for long-term U.S.-backed security guarantees, which he considers vital for any sustainable peace agreement. The summit was noted for having a more constructive tone than a previous tense meeting between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles secured a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave, strengthening their position at the top of the men's Hundred tournament standings. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133, with standout performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In the chase, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox and Sam Curran, who both scored half-centuries, guided the Invincibles to their target with 11 balls remaining. This win places the defending champions four points clear, making them strong contenders for the final stages of the competition.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn, with Bitcoin falling to approximately $115,000 after recently hitting a new all-time high above $124,000. The decline was triggered by a market-wide liquidation wave exceeding $500 million, spurred by investor concerns over higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data which has cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve rate cut. This price correction reflects broader market anxieties as investors take profits and react to macroeconomic signals ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium.

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener announced he is authoring legislation that would make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to wear masks that obscure their identity while on duty. The proposal was prompted by the appearance of masked ICE agents at a press conference held by Governor Gavin Newsom regarding redistricting plans. Wiener criticized the presence of what he termed "Trump’s secret police" as an intimidation tactic. The proposed bill aims to ensure law enforcement accountability and transparency during public interactions, though it would include exceptions for specialized units like SWAT teams.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to provide the House Oversight Committee with documents from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case. The turnover of records is scheduled to begin on Friday, averting a potential clash over a congressional subpoena issued earlier in the month. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that while it will take time to produce all records, he appreciated the Trump administration's commitment to transparency on the matter. The investigation involves the late financier Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, and has been the subject of intense public and political scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a powerful Category 4 storm, is projected to move north in the Atlantic, bringing life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents to the U.S. East Coast throughout the week. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the United States, its significant size and strength will generate hazardous coastal conditions. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for areas from the Bahamas to North Carolina's Outer Banks, urging residents and visitors to exercise extreme caution near the ocean. Officials have ordered mandatory evacuations for some coastal islands in anticipation of severe conditions.</p>

          <p>The progressive cable news network MSNBC is being rebranded as "MS NOW," which reportedly stands for "My Source for News, Opinion, and the World." This change comes as its parent company, Comcast, is spinning off MSNBC and other cable channels into a new, separate entity. The move is seen by some analysts as a business decision to offload a declining asset, but also as a strategic maneuver to distance the core NBC brand from the politically charged content of the news channel. This restructuring may also serve to insulate Comcast from potential political pressure from the Trump administration, which has been openly hostile toward the network.</p>

Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, it is less responsive to sudden cost increases from tariffs, which can initially make profitability appear stronger than it is. This accounting lag means the full financial impact of the tariffs may not be immediately visible in upcoming quarterly earnings reports from these major companies. (not investment advice)</p>

Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates.

          <p>Shares of Meta Platforms declined following a report that the company is planning another restructuring of its AI division, its fourth in six months, raising investor questions about its strategy. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's stock remained stable despite competitor Novo Nordisk cutting the price of its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, to $499 per month for cash-paying customers. Analysts suggest the price cut is unlikely to trigger a broader price war that would significantly impact Lilly, as the cash-pay market for diabetes treatments is less critical than the market for weight-loss drugs, where insurance coverage is more limited.

          <p>Jon Luke Evans, a reserve police officer in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, who was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has agreed to voluntarily leave the country. Evans, a Jamaican national, was taken into custody in July as part of increased immigration enforcement actions. The arrest created a dispute between local officials and ICE, as the police department stated it had been assured by federal authorities and the E-Verify system that Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S. An immigration judge has now granted his request for voluntary departure.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang shared insights into his journey to the show, which fulfilled a high school superlative naming him "Most Likely to be on SNL." Yang discussed how pop culture was a crucial tool for him to assimilate after moving from Quebec to Colorado as a child. He also recounted his experience starting as a writer on the show, which he feels gave him a foundational understanding of its inner workings before he became an on-screen performer. Yang is currently nominated for an Emmy for his work on the long-running sketch comedy series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that wages for the average American worker have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years, eroding purchasing power. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households feel their income is not keeping up with the rising cost of living. The analysis found that some professions have been hit harder than others, with educators experiencing the largest deficit between pay growth and inflation. In contrast, workers in sectors like leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wage gains that outpaced inflation due to high demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit centered on the network's airing of false claims that Dominion's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. While agreeing to the settlement, Newsmax did not apologize and maintained that its coverage was fair and balanced. This outcome follows a similar, much larger settlement in which Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million over its broadcasting of the same baseless election fraud allegations.</p>

          <p>An analysis of international support for Ukraine shows that the United States has been the largest single-country donor since Russia's 2022 invasion, committing approximately $130.6 billion. However, when combined, European nations and EU institutions have contributed more, with a total of $165.7 billion. This data, compiled by the Kiel Institute, contradicts claims by Donald Trump that U.S. spending has vastly outstripped that of Europe. The aid from both the U.S. and Europe has been a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a higher proportion of its aid as direct grants.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued an urgent warning about counterfeit Labubu dolls, which pose a serious choking risk to young children. These knockoff toys, sometimes called "Lafufus," can be small enough to block a child's airway or may break into small, hazardous pieces. The agency advises consumers to immediately stop using any fake dolls and to purchase only from reputable sellers to ensure they are getting authentic products from the original creator, Pop Mart. Consumers can identify genuine Labubu dolls by looking for a holographic sticker, a QR code, and specific design details like the number of teeth.</p>
