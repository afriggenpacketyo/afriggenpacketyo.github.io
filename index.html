          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of the Trump administration's tariffs are illegal, potentially requiring billions of dollars in duties to be refunded to businesses. The decision has created significant uncertainty for shippers and the supply chain industry, which are now awaiting a likely appeal to the Supreme Court. While the tariffs remain in place pending the appeal, the ruling questions the executive branch's authority to impose such duties without congressional approval, leaving businesses to navigate a volatile trade environment.

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to send federal forces into Chicago to address gun violence, stating, "we're going in." This prompted a swift rebuke from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who refused to request federal assistance and accused the administration of refusing to coordinate with local government and law enforcement. The conflict highlights the deep political divisions over the use of federal power for local policing, with Trump asserting a federal obligation to act while Pritzker decries the move as uncooperative and unhinged.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed unfounded social media speculation about his death that circulated over Labor Day weekend. He attributed the rumors to his lack of public appearances for two days and dismissed them as "fake news," stating he was actually "very active." The article notes the speculation was fueled by recycled photos showing bruising on his hand, which the White House had previously attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, as well as mild swelling in his legs.</p>

          <p>The maker of Modelo and Corona beers, Constellation Brands, has significantly reduced its full-year financial forecast, causing its stock to fall. The company cited a challenging economic environment that has dampened consumer demand, particularly among its key Hispanic consumer base. CEO Bill Newlands noted that high-end beer purchases have slowed due to decreased trip frequency and spending, a trend the company links to concerns over immigration policies and potential job losses in that community.

This marks the first time in his career that Alcaraz has reached a Grand Slam semi-final without dropping a single set, a feat not achieved by a man so young since Rafael Nadal in 2008.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the narrative of rampant violence often highlighted in national politics, Chicago is experiencing a dramatic decrease in violent crime this year. Robberies have reportedly fallen by a third compared to the previous year, and the city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade. The article notes that while violence remains a serious issue, it is heavily concentrated in a few specific neighborhoods, with most of the city, including tourist areas, remaining largely safe from gun-related crime.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the Differences Between Debt Consolidation Loans and Programs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article distinguishes between two common methods for managing credit card debt: debt consolidation loans and debt consolidation programs. A loan involves taking out a new, typically lower-interest loan from a bank or credit union to pay off existing debts, simplifying payments into one. A program, offered by a debt relief company, functions similarly but often involves the company facilitating the loan and managing the repayment process, which may offer more flexibility for borrowers with imperfect credit.

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, former UK deputy prime minister and a past executive at Meta, has accused U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other right-wing American politicians of "rank hypocrisy." Clegg criticized them for attacking UK speech laws, like the Online Safety Act, while simultaneously working to "intimidate and bully" their own critics in the United States. He argued that this represents an "outrageous double standard" and warned that the relationship between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration is beginning to resemble "Chinese-style cooperation."</p>

          <p>This article outlines three primary ways retirees could lose a portion of their Social Security benefits. These include working while claiming benefits before reaching full retirement age and earning above a certain threshold, which results in a temporary reduction. Benefits can also be garnished to pay for federal debts like back taxes or student loans, or they can be subject to income tax based on total income. Finally, changes in eligibility, such as a change in marital status for those receiving spousal benefits, can also affect payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, has filed a discharge petition to compel a House vote on legislation that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna, aims to bypass House leadership and bring the issue to the floor for a vote. The move reflects growing pressure from both parties for greater transparency following an internal DOJ review that found no "client list" among the documents.</p>

          <p>With federal funding set to expire at the end of the month, Congress has only 14 legislative days to pass a spending bill and prevent a government shutdown. Lawmakers are expected to pursue a short-term continuing resolution, but reaching a bipartisan agreement will be challenging. The debate is complicated by deep divisions over long-term funding levels and a recent White House move to rescind foreign aid, which Democrats have called an unconstitutional overreach of executive power that undermines bipartisan cooperation.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., has refused to indict an Indiana woman who was arrested for allegedly making death threats against President Donald Trump on social media. This is one of several recent instances where D.C. grand juries have rejected indictments in cases brought by federal prosecutors related to the administration's law enforcement surge in the capital. The rare move has fueled speculation that jurors may be using their votes to protest the federal crackdown, with the defendant's lawyer arguing the evidence is weak.</p>
