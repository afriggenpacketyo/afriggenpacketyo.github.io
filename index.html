          <p>A BBC cyber correspondent engaged with hackers claiming responsibility for recent cyber attacks on M&S and Co-op, who shared evidence of stolen customer and employee data. The hackers, believed to be associated with the DragonForce cyber crime service, expressed frustration over Co-op's refusal to meet their ransom demands. This interaction led Co-op to acknowledge the significant data breach, which they had initially downplayed. DragonForce, a ransomware-as-a-service provider, has been actively targeting organizations since 2023, offering various cyber criminal services in exchange for a cut of ransoms.</p>

          <p>A bombing near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI. The explosion, which occurred on Saturday morning, resulted in one fatality and at least four injuries, causing significant damage to nearby buildings. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the FBI leading what they describe as one of the largest bombing investigations in Southern California. The clinic confirmed that no staff members were harmed and that the eggs and embryos stored in the lab remained secure, expecting to resume normal operations soon.</p>

          <p>The Menendez brothers, convicted of murdering their parents, have seen a resurgence of public sympathy due to evolving understanding of trauma and sexual abuse. New evidence and media portrayals have led to a resentencing that includes the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. The brothers' claims of sexual assault by their father, once widely mocked, are now viewed with more understanding, influenced by the MeToo movement and a shift towards rehabilitation in criminal justice. Their fate now rests with California's Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom, who will weigh shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but only for adults over 65 and individuals over 12 with specific medical conditions that increase their risk from COVID-19. This decision sharply limits access to the vaccine for healthy individuals under 65 and requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects. Experts have expressed disappointment, citing the ongoing need for accessible vaccines and raising concerns that these restrictions reflect skepticism toward vaccines within the FDA. The approval also bucks norms that have been in place since the vaccines were first approved.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, creating near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time. The storm, fueled by dry soil conditions and strong winds from thunderstorms, caused a dramatic scene as it moved into downtown Chicago. Such storms are more common in the Southwest and southern Great Plains, and the event has raised concerns about soil moisture levels in the area.

          <p>Austrian singer JJ won the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland, with the song "Wasted Love," an electro-ballad about unrequited love, after a close finish. The UK's act, Remember Monday, placed 19th. The event was marked by controversy over Israel's participation, with pro-Palestinian protests taking place before the contest.

While both sides aim to strengthen cooperation, disagreements persist over issues like fishing rights and access to EU defense contracts. The summit is expected to yield a joint declaration on geopolitical priorities and a security and defense pact, but trade measures are likely to be limited by the UK's red lines on EU membership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has settled litigation to end the ban on forced-reset triggers, devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire at rates approaching those of machine guns. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the decision was based on the belief that the Second Amendment is not a second-class right. Gun safety advocates have criticized the move, arguing that it will make firearms more dangerous by allowing gun owners to transform their weapons into virtual machine guns. The Justice Department said the new settlement included gun-safety provisions and would prevent the sale of forced-reset triggers in pistols.</p>
