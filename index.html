          <p>Cory Bowman, Vice President JD Vance's half-brother and an evangelical pastor, is challenging Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval in the nonpartisan primary. Bowman, along with Republican challenger Brian Frank, aims to unseat the incumbent Democrat, Pureval, who previously served as a special assistant U.S. attorney and Hamilton County clerk of courts. Bowman stated that his half-brother’s inauguration inspired him to get involved in politics, emphasizing that he seeks to improve Cincinnati rather than engage in national politics. Voters will also decide on State Issue 2, a program reauthorizing $2.5 billion for local infrastructure projects over the next decade. </p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and increased tariffs on Chinese goods, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain major players in the U.S. online retail market. These companies are implementing localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shipping goods in bulk to U.S. warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on these platforms have risen, experts argue that Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and previously low prices will allow them to remain competitive. The success of these companies is attributed to their adaptive supply chains and small-batch production models.</p>

Akihito was previously hospitalized in 2012 for coronary-artery bypass surgery and received treatment for heart failure in 2022.

Two defense ministers and numerous senior People’s Liberation Army officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions. The article raises concerns about the competence and reliability of China’s military commanders due to these dismissals, suggesting it might weaken Xi’s appetite for war.

Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022, but unanimous support for sanctions remains elusive due to opposition from Hungary and Slovakia.</p>

          <p>El Salvador President Nayib Bukele ordered the arrest of five bus company heads after they defied his order to provide free transport for a week. Bukele accused them of sabotaging the country, alleging the government would cover their normal daily income, a claim not immediately verifiable. The arrests, conducted by heavily armed officers, were for breach of duty, denial of assistance, and extortion. The move highlights Bukele's authoritarian tactics amid criticisms of undermining democratic institutions under a state of emergency.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, Germany continues to search for and rebury the remains of its fallen soldiers, with a recent internment ceremony held near Berlin. The German War Graves Commission has been working for decades to find, exhume, and rebury soldiers across Europe. Despite the controversial nature of honoring soldiers who served in the Nazi military, the organization focuses on providing dignified burials to every person who died in the war. The effort highlights the ongoing physical and emotional legacy of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz have largely dismissed Donald Trump's plan to reopen the former prison, calling it "insane" and an unfeasible political stunt. Many expressed shock at the idea of reviving the notorious prison, citing its high operating costs and the island's significance as a site of Indigenous resistance. The National Park Service, which operates Alcatraz as a museum, has not commented, but staff members expressed exasperation. The proposal has sparked debate about the island's legacy and its role in American history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has closed a tariff loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, that allowed inexpensive goods from China to enter the U.S. without tariffs, potentially impacting delivery companies like UPS and FedEx. The move is expected to slow the flow of low-value shipments, which had become a significant source of revenue for these companies. While some analysts suggest logistics companies may find alternative markets, the broader trade war could make it harder to compensate for lost sales. Temu, a major e-commerce company, has already shifted to using locally based sellers.</p>
