          <p>England and Canada, the top two ranked teams in women's rugby, are set to face each other in the World Cup final on Saturday. Tournament hosts England, who are fully professional and on a 32-match winning streak, are considered the favorites as they seek their third title. In contrast, the Canadian team is not professional and relied on a fundraising campaign to support their tournament preparations. The match is a rematch of the 2014 final, which England won, and marks a significant moment for the sport's global growth.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.4 earthquake centered in Berkeley rattled the San Francisco Bay Area in the early morning hours, waking residents across the region. The tremor, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was centered near the UC Berkeley campus and triggered the MyShake earthquake early warning application. While no major injuries were immediately reported, the shaking was strong enough to cause minor damage, such as dishes falling from shelves in some homes. The event serves as a reminder of the region's seismic activity.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has indicated a potential reopening of diplomatic talks with the United States, contingent on Washington abandoning its "obsession" with denuclearization. Speaking to North Korea's legislature, Kim stated there would be no reason not to resume negotiations if the U.S. accepts peaceful coexistence based on recognizing the reality of North Korea's nuclear status. While expressing positive memories of his past meetings with President Trump, Kim emphasized that his country's nuclear arsenal, which is now constitutionally protected, was developed for survival and is irreversible.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to Africa have surged by 25%, totaling $140.8 billion, as manufacturers seek alternative markets in response to U.S. tariffs. According to China's customs data, the growth rate of exports to Africa is two to four times faster than to other major regions like Europe and Asia. Analysts suggest that the significant tariffs imposed by the U.S. are a primary driver for this shift, compelling Chinese companies to redirect their goods to the African continent. This trend highlights the strategic adjustments in global trade patterns resulting from ongoing economic disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich argues that America's traditional leadership class—including university presidents, religious figures, and business executives—has fallen silent and abdicated its moral responsibility during a time of democratic crisis. Reich contends that these leaders, once vocal on major social issues, are now motivated by cowardice and self-interest, failing to defend constitutional rights against threats from the Trump administration. He concludes that with this vacuum of leadership, the responsibility now falls upon ordinary citizens to rise up and defend democratic principles.</p>

          <p>The recent death of actor Robert Redford has brought renewed attention to the 1983 unsolved murder of Sid Wells, the boyfriend of Redford's daughter, Shauna. Wells was fatally shot at his Boulder, Colorado apartment, and his roommate, Thayne Alan Smika, was arrested but never formally charged due to insufficient evidence before disappearing in 1986. The case was reopened with new DNA testing in 2009, leading to a new arrest warrant for Smika in 2010. The FBI is now offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Smika's capture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is facing a severe financial crisis, with its debt now exceeding $22.5 billion, as devastating floods become more frequent and costly. The program is caught between conflicting congressional mandates to provide affordable, widespread coverage while remaining fiscally sound, a balance that is increasingly impossible to maintain. Experts argue the system creates a moral hazard by subsidizing risk and encouraging development in flood-prone areas, leading to a political reckoning over who should bear the escalating costs of climate change-related disasters.</p>

The implant, the size of a lima bean, delivers daily electrical pulses to the nerve in the neck, which helps regulate the body's inflammatory response by signaling the spleen to reduce cytokine production. While not a universal cure, clinical trials showed meaningful improvement in about 35% of a difficult-to-treat patient group.

          <p>Colleges across the U.S. are cutting staff and services for programs that support students from migrant farmworker families after the Trump administration abruptly halted federal funding. The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), which has provided academic, financial, and mental health support to first-year college students since 1972, was paused after the administration claimed it was costly and ineffective. The move has left participating universities scrambling to find alternative funding and has prompted a lawsuit from a national association representing the programs, which serve thousands of students annually.</p>

          <p>Following his assassination, the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk highlighted the deep integration of his evangelical Christian faith with his political ideology. Speakers at the service, including President Trump, framed him as a "martyr for American freedom," while his work often used religious arguments to oppose concepts like DEI and abortion. Over his career, Kirk's views shifted from supporting a separation of church and state to arguing that the U.S. was founded as a Christian nation and could not function otherwise, a stance that has drawn concern from observers of Christian nationalism.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to hold an emergency session following Estonia's report that three Russian MiG-31 jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes. Estonia, requesting the meeting for the first time in its UN membership, called the incident a "brazen violation," a charge Moscow denies. The event has heightened regional tensions, with Germany condemning the incursion as "unacceptable." This diplomatic escalation occurs alongside ongoing conflict, as Ukrainian officials report a deadly Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia and a Ukrainian drone attack in Russian-occupied Crimea.</p>

          <p>Russia is lobbying the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to ease Western sanctions, arguing the restrictions on aircraft spare parts and overflights pose a critical threat to flight safety. Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, sanctions have cut off Russian airlines from foreign-made parts for their predominantly Airbus and Boeing fleets, forcing them to use complex import routes. Moscow contends these "unlawful coercive measures" violate international rules and is seeking relief as its aging fleet shows signs of degradation, creating a challenge for the ICAO's upcoming assembly.</p>
