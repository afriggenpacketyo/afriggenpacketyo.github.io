          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., leading the "Make America Healthy Again Commission," attempted to reassure farmers and Republicans about his upcoming report on pesticides and childhood chronic diseases. He emphasized that the report would not harm farmers' businesses, particularly those relying on glyphosate. Kennedy acknowledged the widespread use of glyphosate in U.S. agriculture and assured that the commission would propose pro-innovation policies to address concerns about environmental toxins without implementing restrictive regulations. His adviser, Calley Means, stated the report aims to highlight areas of broad scientific agreement regarding toxins affecting children, including pesticides, ultra-processed foods, and added sugars.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada issued strong condemnations of Israel's escalating military actions in Gaza and its restrictions on humanitarian aid, signaling increasing frustration from key Western allies. The countries criticized Israel's actions as disproportionate and egregious, particularly amid warnings of famine in Gaza. Britain suspended free-trade agreement talks with Israel, while the three nations jointly demanded an end to the renewed military offensive and the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian aid. Prime Minister Netanyahu responded by accusing these nations of rewarding Hamas and undermining Israel's right to defend itself, highlighting the widening rift between Israel and some of its staunchest supporters over the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under scrutiny after the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, charged Representative LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, with assaulting federal agents during an oversight visit to an immigrant-detention facility. Critics argue that the charges are politically motivated, designed to punish criticism and intimidate Democrats, especially given Trump's history of politicizing the Justice Department. The article contrasts this case with the DOJ's handling of cases related to the January 6th insurrection, where some cases against rioters were dismissed and some individuals were pardoned, raising further questions about the administration's commitment to defending law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has implemented temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport to address severe delays and cancellations caused by technology outages, staff shortages among air traffic controllers, and runway construction. Flights will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with further restrictions through October 25. The FAA aims to alleviate inconvenience to travelers and ensure safe and reliable operations, with United Airlines supporting the move. The airport faces a significant staffing shortage, with only 24 air traffic controllers currently overseeing Newark, far less than the 38 estimated as necessary for smooth operation.</p>

The court expressed concern over the resolution's lack of clarity, examples, and guidance for teachers, leading to confusion and self-censorship among educators. The ruling is part of an ongoing legal battle over the ban, initiated in 2022 by conservative school board members who opposed certain materials in the curriculum. While the school district faces opposition in California, federal headwinds, including Trump's executive orders promoting school choice and patriotic education, favor their stance.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for broader use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence in low-risk groups. Vaccine makers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to "all healthy persons" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old.</p>

Stuart Scheller, who criticized senior military leaders after the Kabul airport bombing.
