          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic heavy metal vocalist for Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His death follows a public battle with Parkinson's disease, which he was diagnosed with in 2019, and a series of other health issues that led him to retire from touring. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's influential career spanned over five decades, from co-founding the genre-defining band to achieving massive success as a solo artist. He also became a beloved television personality in the 2000s with the reality show "The Osbournes," introducing him to a new generation.</p>

          <p>Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, has approved a bill that imposes fines on internet users for searching or accessing online content deemed "extremist" by authorities. The legislation would penalize individuals with fines up to 5,000 rubles for viewing materials on a government list that includes over 5,000 entries, such as songs praising Ukraine and blog posts by Pussy Riot. The bill has drawn criticism from opposition activists and even some pro-government figures, who raise concerns about its broad scope and unclear implementation. Protesters have been arrested for demonstrating against the measure, which they compare to totalitarian surveillance.</p>

          <h2>Arsenal Nears Completion of Transfer Deal for Sporting Striker Viktor Gyokeres</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 14:38:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting, with negotiations over add-on payments causing a slight delay. The transfer, valued at approximately £63.5 million, will see the 27-year-old forward join the Gunners on a five-year contract. Gyokeres has been a highly sought-after player after a prolific season where he scored 54 goals in 52 games for the Portuguese club. His signing is expected to bolster Arsenal's attacking options as manager Mikel Arteta seeks to add an elite center-forward to the squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States has reached a trade and military agreement with the Philippines, although Manila has not yet confirmed the deal. According to Trump, the arrangement includes a 19% tariff on goods imported from the Philippines, while U.S. goods will face no tariffs. The announcement followed a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who stated his country is modernizing its military with U.S. assistance due to regional tensions. This development is part of Trump's broader strategy of using tariff letters to negotiate new bilateral trade deals with various nations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings from a $20,000 certificate of deposit (CD), comparing current rates to those available a year prior. It demonstrates that while CD rates have decreased, they still offer substantial returns; for instance, a 2-year CD opened in 2024 at 5.72% would earn nearly $700 more than one opened in 2025 at 4.10%. Despite the decline from last year's peaks, current rates are significantly higher than those from the early 2020s. The analysis suggests that CDs remain a predictable and secure savings vehicle for those looking to avoid market volatility (not investment advice).</p>

Trump urged reporters to focus on recently published materials from his spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard, which he claims show Obama officials politicized intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. He dismissed the Epstein controversy as a politically motivated "witch hunt" and said it was time to investigate his allegations about the 2016 election instead.

While the White House approved the transfer of Patriot anti-missile systems, it also gave Russia a 50-day period to negotiate before considering new sanctions. The author argues this ultimatum effectively gives Russia the rest of the summer to intensify its bombing campaigns and ground assaults against Ukraine without facing immediate consequences. This approach is seen as stringing Ukraine along with insufficient support while providing a strategic gift to Vladimir Putin, allowing him to maximize territorial gains before any potential peace talks.</p>

          <p>Police in Costa Rica have confirmed the cause of death for actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." An autopsy concluded that the 54-year-old's death was an accidental drowning, described as asphyxiation by submersion. Warner was reportedly caught in a rip current while swimming off the Caribbean coast and could not be revived after bystanders brought him to shore. The actor, who also had a successful career in music and other television roles, was in the country on a family vacation at the time of the tragic incident.</p>

          <p>A passenger aboard a SkyWest flight described the terrifying moment the aircraft made an aggressive, abrupt turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The passenger compared the force of the maneuver to a sharp turn on a roller coaster. After landing safely, the pilot informed the 76 passengers that the military aircraft had appeared unexpectedly, and he made the split-second decision to turn behind it. The B-52 was part of a pre-planned flyover for the state fair, but the airport's air traffic control tower allegedly did not advise the commercial flight of its presence.</p>

Howard Phillips offered to provide personal information about former UK Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents.

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle is shrinking, according to a new survey from Bankrate. The report found that 27% of Americans have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in the previous year and the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic anxiety that drove many to take on extra work. This shift suggests that more people are now using extra income for discretionary spending rather than covering basic living expenses.</p>

King's social media post, stating "Now, do the Epstein Files," connects the two high-profile cases and amplifies public pressure on the administration for transparency.

While the city is offering a permit program to exempt some current RV residents who agree to work towards finding traditional housing, critics argue the plan is cruel.

          <p>This article analyzes the recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," framing it as a significant cultural loss and a sign of corporate fecklessness. While CBS cited financial reasons, with the show reportedly losing $40 million annually, the timing has raised questions, as it came just days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's legal settlement with Donald Trump. The author argues that Colbert's show served a vital function by providing sharp, morally grounded commentary on the news, unbound by traditional journalistic constraints. Its departure leaves a void in network television for principled, authoritative political satire.</p>
