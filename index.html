          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, emphasized that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. unless all tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are reviewed. Akazawa stressed the importance of addressing tariffs on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, which are critical to Japan's exports. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the 25% duties on the auto industry, which significantly impacts their exports to the United States. Japan aims to protect its national interests and seeks common ground with the U.S. on tariff measures, though disagreements persist.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:35:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented 25% tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, intended to boost domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars. The new tariffs impact vehicles made in the United States, as they often contain foreign-made components, but components from Canada and Mexico are exempt under certain trade agreement conditions. Automakers warn that relocation of assembly lines will take years and the uncertainty around trade policy could drive some suppliers out of business, leading to parts shortages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is designed to reduce the use of 'elderspeak,' a communication style resembling baby talk, when interacting with older adults. Clarissa Shaw defines elderspeak as communication that assumes frailty, incompetence, and dependence, often involving terms of endearment or plural pronouns. Studies show that elderspeak can lead to resistance to care, and CHAT has demonstrated success in reducing both elderspeak and resistant behaviors in nursing homes. The program is now being adapted for online use to reach more facilities and promote respectful communication with older individuals.</p>

          <p>Following the release of internal reports revealing the presence of antisemitism and Islamophobia at Harvard, adjunct professor Eugene Litvak acknowledged the university's unpreparedness for the challenges that emerged after the October 7th Hamas attack.

Litvak also stressed the importance of addressing the financial dangers facing public healthcare programs, advocating for improved efficiency in existing systems before implementing budget cuts.

          <p>The retrial of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, is underway amidst controversy surrounding the initial police investigation. Michael Proctor, the former state trooper who led the investigation, was fired due to his reprehensible comments and alleged mishandling of evidence. The defense argues that O'Keefe was killed inside a house and the scene was staged, pointing to inconsistencies in the evidence and witness testimonies. With a new special prosecutor and the same conflicting evidence, the retrial faces the challenge of overcoming the shadow of the flawed investigation and proving Read's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

The U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century, with nearly one in three children under five requiring hospitalization. Experts fear that misinformation spread by figures like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will undermine public confidence in vaccines and hinder efforts to control the spread of preventable diseases.

          <p>Police are questioning a man after the skeletal remains of his former girlfriend were discovered in his home near Tokyo. The man, who had previously been warned for stalking 20-year-old Asahi Okazaki, returned to Japan from overseas. Okazaki disappeared in December, and autopsy findings indicate that she had been dead for over a month and showed signs of burning.

          <p>Early vote counts in Australia's general election indicate that the current government is likely to be reelected for a second term. The ruling center-left Labor Party is projected to win a majority of seats, while the opposition lags behind. Energy policy and inflation are key issues, with the opposition blaming government waste for rising inflation and interest rates. The election marks the first time younger voters outnumber baby boomers, influencing campaign strategies and policy promises.</p>

          <p>A Member of Parliament is advocating for a modern approach to the regulations prohibiting alcohol consumption in football stands, which have been in place since 1985. The current law bans fans from drinking alcohol within view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football, but other sports are exempt. Trials are taking place in the women's game to assess the impact of lifting these restrictions. The MP suggests small-scale trials in the lower leagues to determine a suitable path forward.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. The study tracked axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, noting their ability to survive, gain weight, and avoid predators. This success highlights the potential for reintroduction programs to aid in the conservation of axolotls and mitigate the effects of habitat degradation. The findings are particularly significant for Mexicans, as axolotls are deeply rooted in their culture and history.</p>
