          <p>A recent review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales reveals significant flaws in data collection, making it impossible to accurately assess the scale of the issue. The report emphasizes the lack of reliable ethnicity data for perpetrators, hindering the ability to draw national conclusions. Recommendations include a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, mandatory collection of ethnicity data for suspects, and tightening laws to ensure adults who sexually assault children under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The report also addresses taxi licensing loopholes that can put children at risk and calls for more rigorous licensing standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pledged to intensify immigration enforcement in Democratic-led cities, alleging that these cities are using undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base, a claim without evidence. This announcement comes amidst reports that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is significantly over budget and may run out of funds soon. Trump's stance on immigration has been inconsistent, previously ordering ICE to halt workplace enforcement actions that harm industries relying on immigrant labor. His renewed focus on deportations and use of the term "remigration" have drawn criticism, with analysts suggesting he is politicizing law enforcement. </p>

Analysts suggest that the price of oil is the most critical factor for the global economy and stock market. The biggest risk to oil prices would be the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, which could cause prices to spike above $100 a barrel (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Failing to repay a cash advance app can lead to several negative consequences, including overdraft fees, loss of app access, and potential referral to a collection agency. Some apps may attempt to withdraw funds multiple times, further draining a low-balance account. While legal action is rare, it remains a possibility if the debt is passed to a collections firm. It's crucial to communicate with the app's customer service, explore repayment options, and consider alternative assistance if consistently short on cash.</p>

          <p>A juror in the Sean "Diddy" Combs sexual assault and racketeering trial in New York City was dismissed due to inconsistencies about his residency and replaced with an alternate juror. The court raised concerns about the juror's candor and whether he shaded answers to get on the jury. The trial resumed with testimony from a paralegal detailing messages sent by Combs' personal assistant about setting up a "hotel night". Combs has pleaded not guilty and faces up to life in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>French authorities have closed off Israeli weapons industry booths at the Paris Air Show, citing a ban on "offensive weapons" displays amid conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move condemned by Israel.

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision, citing France's concerns about Gaza.

          <h2>Guardian Columnist Decries Trump's 'Disappointing, Sad Affair' of a Parade</h2>

          <p>A Guardian columnist describes President Trump's military parade as a disappointing and sad affair, contrasting it with the large-scale "No Kings" protests that occurred earlier the same day. The parade, intended to mark the US army's 250th anniversary and celebrate Trump's power, was marked by small turnout and a lack of enthusiasm. The event, according to the article, was meant to celebrate his seizure of power and underscore his determination to quash dissent, with the armed forces used as an ornament to his ego and a threat to his enemies.</p>

          <p>A new elevated waterfront park in New York City is designed to protect the community behind it while providing new access to a recreational area. The park acts as a "wall" to safeguard the community while offering a space for residents to enjoy. The project was a collaboration between city and federal officials and a New York-based non-profit organization.</p>
