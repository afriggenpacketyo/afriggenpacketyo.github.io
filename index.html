          <p>Jafar Panahi's film, ‚ÄúUn Simple Accident,‚Äù won the Palme d‚ÄôOr at the 78th Cannes Film Festival, marking a high point for the Iranian writer-director who had previously been barred from making movies in Iran. The film, shot clandestinely, follows a group of men and women who band together after one of them kidnaps a man they believe tortured them in prison, drawing inspiration from Panahi's own experiences as a political prisoner. The jury, led by Juliette Binoche, also awarded prizes to films from Chinese, Norwegian, and German directors, highlighting the festival's commitment to cinema as an enduring art form despite industry challenges. The event was marked by a sense of celebration, especially given recent threats of tariffs on foreign-made films.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution and having a pending immigration case. Judge Brian Murphy criticized the government for initially claiming O.C.G. said he wasn't afraid of being sent to Mexico, where he had previously been sexually assaulted, before admitting they couldn't verify this statement. The judge found that O.C.G.'s removal lacked due process, highlighting ongoing legal battles over the administration's deportation policies. The ruling adds to growing concerns about due process violations in deportation cases.</p>
