          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst estimates, causing its stock to decline in after-hours trading. While revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed expectations, adjusted earnings per share were one cent below the forecast at 48 cents. The company is navigating U.S. export controls on its AI chips to China, which impacted sales, though its Data Center and Client and Gaming segments both saw significant year-over-year growth. AMD provided an optimistic sales forecast for the current quarter, projecting up to $9 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has lowered its annual production guidance after reporting second-quarter financial results that did not meet Wall Street's expectations. The company now projects producing between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles, down from a firm 20,000, citing a cautious approach to the year's uncertainties. Lucid's revenue and earnings per share both fell short of analyst forecasts, leading to a drop in its stock price in after-hours trading. The automaker is working to ramp up production of its Gravity SUV amid supply chain constraints and slowing EV demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Snap's stock plummeted 15% following its second-quarter earnings report, which revealed that its global average revenue per user (ARPU) missed analyst expectations. The company attributed the weaker-than-expected topline growth to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes. While daily active users exceeded forecasts at 469 million, the miss on the key ARPU metric signaled struggles in monetizing its user base compared to peers. Snap did, however, provide a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of Wall Street estimates, suggesting potential for recovery.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a bar in the town of Anaconda. Governor Greg Gianforte has declared the search the state's highest priority, authorizing additional resources for the more than three dozen law enforcement agencies involved. The suspect, who authorities believe is armed and dangerous, fled after the shooting and is thought to be in a mountainous, forested area. Family members have stated that Brown has a history of mental illness, including PTSD from his military service.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic examines the term 'Russia hoax,' a phrase frequently used by Donald Trump to dismiss investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The piece argues that despite Trump's claims, the core findings of U.S. intelligence and the Mueller report—that Russia did interfere to help Trump—are not a hoax. It traces how the definition of the 'hoax' has shifted over time, from allegations of illegal surveillance to a general 'witch hunt' narrative. The article contends that recent efforts to legitimize the 'hoax' claim are based on debunked information and misinterpretations.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings for a $10,000 deposit in either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. With current rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.30% APY would narrowly outperform a 3-month CD at 4.25% APY over the same period, though the difference is minimal. The key distinction is that the CD rate is fixed and guaranteed, whereas the savings account rate is variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as anticipated. Savers must weigh the guaranteed return of a CD against the flexibility of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion column posits that Kamala Harris, despite speculation about another presidential run, is not the solution for the Democratic Party's current unpopularity. The author argues that the party's low favorability stems from voter discontent with both its loss to Donald Trump and its perceived ineffectiveness as an opposition. The piece suggests that Harris symbolizes this discontent, as she struggles to appeal beyond the party's base and failed to flip Trump voters in the last election. Her political style, described as crafted by focus groups, lacks the authenticity needed to expand the Democratic coalition.</p>

          <p>This article advises homeowners considering a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to ask critical questions before borrowing. With HELOC interest rates being variable, homeowners should assess the likelihood and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may not significantly lower payments in the short term. It also suggests comparing a HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, as their average rates are currently similar. The choice depends on whether a borrower prefers the flexibility of a credit line or the stability of a fixed-rate lump sum. (not investment advice)</p>

This effort has prompted a dramatic response from Texas Democrats, who fled the state to block the vote, and threats of retaliatory gerrymandering from Democratic governors in states like California and New York, setting the stage for a nationwide political battle.</p>
