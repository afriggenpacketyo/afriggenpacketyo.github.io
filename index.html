        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol sector is facing a potential collapse after the government decided against providing a financial rescue package. The country's two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus, have warned of imminent closure, citing a recent UK-US trade deal that allows for tariff-free imports of American ethanol, rendering their operations commercially unviable. This decision has been criticized for undermining a key national asset in clean fuels and potentially shifting green energy jobs overseas. The government stated the rescue was not in the national interest and would not solve the industry's long-term issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit aimed at discussing the war in Ukraine. The meeting occurs just after Russia launched a significant overnight assault on Ukraine, involving dozens of drones and two ballistic missiles. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the summit was arranged quickly, with the president hoping to quickly assess whether a peace agreement is feasible. The primary American goal is to achieve a ceasefire to allow for broader conversations about security guarantees and territorial disputes.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment is notable given the insurer's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price throughout 2025. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in beleaguered companies, and the disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to surge in extended trading. Berkshire also adjusted other positions, slightly reducing its holdings in Apple and Bank of America while adding smaller stakes in several other firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have acknowledged a challenging period for staff following a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission. Employees raised alarms about the institute's potential collapse after the government mandated a new focus on defense and threatened to withdraw funding. In response, management confirmed the strategic pivot to defense but stated that work on healthcare and environmental issues would continue. Critics within the organization have labeled the leadership's response as performative, citing a lack of concrete action to address concerns about a toxic internal culture.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that restricted cooperation between the Metropolitan Police Department and federal immigration agents. This action effectively reverses the city's 'sanctuary' policies, enabling full collaboration with agencies like ICE, as part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the capital. The move was enacted under an executive order that temporarily places the D.C. police under federal control. However, D.C. city officials, including the local Attorney General, have contested the legality of Bondi's order, stating the police department is not obligated to follow it.</p>

          <p>United Nations talks aimed at creating a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution have failed to produce an agreement. After nearly three years of negotiations, countries remain deeply divided on the core issue. A coalition of approximately 100 nations, including the UK and EU, advocated for curbs on plastic production, while major oil-producing states like Saudi Arabia and Russia insisted the focus should be on improving recycling and waste management. The collapse of the talks is a significant setback for environmental efforts to address the growing crisis of plastic waste in oceans, soil, and human bodies.</p>

          <p>The upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska will cast a spotlight on their complex and deteriorating relationship. During his first term, Trump often praised the Russian leader, but his tone has shifted dramatically amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, recently calling Putin's actions "crazy." This summit marks a critical juncture, as Trump attempts to leverage their personal dynamic to broker an end to the conflict, a goal he has found increasingly frustrating. The meeting is a test of whether direct, eye-to-eye negotiation can yield results where previous strategies have failed.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory remarks at an anti-racism protest. During the rally in Walthamstow last year, Jones was filmed calling far-right demonstrators "Nazi fascists" and gestured cutting his throat while saying "we need to get rid of them all." Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, argued his comments were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence, claiming they referred to a specific threat involving razor blades on public transport. The jury acquitted him after a brief deliberation.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that the prime minister appoint members of his party to the House of Lords. In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Farage argued that the upper chamber's composition is democratically imbalanced, as parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK has none. He highlighted that his party received over 4.1 million votes in the last general election and has since gained significant local government seats. While political appointments are at the prime minister's discretion, this move pressures the government to acknowledge Reform's electoral performance.</p>

          <p>A senior lawyer in Australia has apologized to a judge after court submissions in a murder trial were found to contain fake quotes and non-existent case judgments created by artificial intelligence. The defense lawyer took full responsibility for the error, which caused a 24-hour delay in the Supreme Court of Victoria case. This incident adds to a growing list of legal mishaps worldwide caused by the misuse of generative AI tools. The judge emphasized that relying on the accuracy of submissions is fundamental to the justice system and that any AI-generated content must be independently and thoroughly verified.</p>

          <p>Women who served in the Kosovo Liberation Army during the 1998-99 war are struggling for public and institutional recognition, despite holding official veteran status. While they performed diverse and critical roles, from combat to medical support, their contributions are often overlooked compared to their male counterparts. Many female veterans report facing discrimination and being excluded from commemorative events and public narratives about the war. This societal neglect is compounded by economic hardships and a patriarchal mentality that can limit their participation in post-war public life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper shows a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving key life milestones compared to previous generations. Fewer are getting married, having children, working full-time, or living independently from their parents. Fifty years ago, nearly half of this age group had reached all four benchmarks, whereas today, less than a quarter have. Researchers attribute this trend primarily to economic pressures, including the rising cost of college, substantial student loan debt, and a severe housing affordability crisis, which have raised the financial bar for starting a family.</p>

Many view the increased presence, which includes roadblocks and immigration raids, as an unnecessary and intimidating show of force, particularly since city leaders contest the existence of a major crime wave. Witnesses described aggressive tactics, such as agents apprehending individuals who appeared Hispanic near a Home Depot. Critics and residents feel the move is more about political optics than public safety, creating an atmosphere of fear in the city.</p>

          <p>The escalating redistricting conflict, exemplified by Republican plans in Texas and a proposed Democratic counter in California, highlights a growing threat to American democracy. Political analysts warn that redrawing congressional maps in the middle of a decade, rather than only after the census, makes elections secondary to the political maneuvers of legislators. This practice of "re-gerrymandering" allows parties to lock in advantages based on recent data, reducing competition and fostering public cynicism. While some Democrats argue it is a necessary response to Republican tactics, critics caution that it starts a race to the bottom that further undermines the electoral process.</p>

          <p>Investment firms for the world's wealthiest families, known as family offices, have significantly increased their investments in private markets like direct lending and infrastructure over the past decade. Data from Preqin shows a more than 500% surge since 2016 in the number of family offices allocating funds to these assets. This trend is driven by the large amounts of wealth these firms manage and their long-term investment horizons, which make them well-suited for illiquid private assets that offer stable growth potential compared to volatile public markets. While still bullish, recent surveys indicate they are becoming more selective, favoring private debt over private equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain advanced AI chips to China, contingent on a 15 percent tax on the proceeds. This move reverses a previous block on the export of Nvidia's H20 chip and has caused significant internal dissent, with some officials reportedly considering resignation over national security concerns. Critics argue the deal violates the spirit of export controls designed to limit China's AI capabilities and may be unconstitutional. The debate centers on whether providing these chips helps China catch up to the U.S. or simply diverts them from using domestic alternatives like those from Huawei.</p>

The Justice Department has unsealed indictments against Álvarez, also known as "The Grandfather," and four other high-ranking members of the cartel.
