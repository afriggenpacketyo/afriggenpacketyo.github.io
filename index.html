          <p>John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor to former President Donald Trump, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland. This development makes Bolton the third high-profile critic of the former president to face criminal charges in recent weeks, following indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The charges stem from a national security investigation into classified records, which prompted an FBI raid on Bolton's home and office in August. Bolton's lawyer has not yet commented on the indictment.</p>

The database software giant projects substantial growth, anticipating $20 billion in revenue from its AI-powered database and data platforms by fiscal year 2030. This deal is part of a broader trend of major tech companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure to support their initiatives. Oracle also raised its long-term financial targets, now aiming for $225 billion in revenue by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A network of over 340 former U.S. intelligence and national security officials has released a report warning that the United States is on a trajectory toward "competitive authoritarianism." The assessment, conducted by the group Steady State, applies analytical methods typically used for foreign nations to evaluate domestic democratic decline under the Trump administration. The report identifies key indicators such as the expansion of executive power, politicization of federal agencies, and erosion of judicial independence. The authors conclude with moderate to high confidence that these trends risk consolidating executive dominance and undermining democratic institutions if left unchecked.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to significantly reduce the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs through negotiations with biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono. President Trump stated that this agreement will lead to an estimated 73% decrease in the per-cycle cost of these drugs for American consumers. The deal involves providing substantial discounts on critical fertility drugs, which are currently much more expensive in the U.S. than elsewhere. While this move addresses a major component of IVF expenses, the overall cost of a full cycle, which includes procedures and fees, will not decrease by the same margin.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed a lengthy phone call between the two leaders, which the Kremlin described as "very informative" and focused on achieving a diplomatic solution. Ahead of the summit, high-level advisors from both nations, led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will hold preparatory meetings. This development comes as Trump has expressed growing frustration with the prolonged conflict and as the U.S. Senate considers imposing new sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <p>A 1904 story from The Atlantic, titled “The American Coup d’Etat of 1961,” presents a grim fable of a future America that mirrors contemporary anxieties about democracy. Written by Henry Dwight Sedgwick, the piece imagined a nation dominated by a wealthy tech innovator and an imperial president who weakens Congress and seeks a third term. The narrative, penned during Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, served as a critique of burgeoning corporate power, materialism, and executive overreach. This historical article offers a striking parallel to modern concerns, portraying a country that loses its constitutional principles while its citizens convince themselves that everything remains unchanged.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting a plan to construct a large triumphal arch in Washington D.C. to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States in the upcoming year. The proposed monument, reportedly to be privately funded, would be located across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial. The design is inspired by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and is part of a series of architectural projects Trump has initiated during his second term. However, the project faces a complex and lengthy approval process involving multiple federal commissions, making its completion by the anniversary date unlikely.</p>

This action follows numerous similar lawsuits in the United States, where the company has faced multi-million dollar verdicts.

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced his intention to soon advance a bipartisan bill imposing new economic sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine, stating "the time has come." The announcement came shortly after President Trump revealed plans for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions legislation, which has broad support with 84 co-sponsors, has been stalled for months due to other geopolitical events and White House concerns. The bill aims to increase pressure on Moscow and includes a significant tariff on goods from countries that purchase Russian energy resources.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC jointly announced the rescission of rules requiring banks to plan for financial risks associated with climate change. The regulators stated the principles were redundant, as existing safety and soundness standards already require institutions to manage all material risks effectively. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee, praised the move as a refocusing on core financial risks and a reduction of compliance burdens. However, the decision drew criticism from Fed Governor Michael Barr, who called it "shortsighted" and warned it would make the financial system riskier as climate-related threats grow.</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Ro Khanna is introducing a House resolution calling for significant reforms at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The resolution urges mandatory body cameras, visible identification for agents, and a ban on facial coverings, citing recent controversial enforcement tactics during federal immigration crackdowns. It also proposes transferring ICE oversight to the Department of Justice and creating civilian review boards. The move follows heightened tensions over immigration operations, but the resolution is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled House, where there is strong support for current enforcement measures.</p>

The players were charged in 2024 in connection with a 2018 incident, but a judge found the prosecution did not meet the burden of proof. While cleared criminally, the NHL's own investigation found their conduct "deeply troubling," and the players are not eligible to play in games until December 1 as part of a league reinstatement process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the average annual percentage rates (APRs) on credit cards have not significantly decreased for consumers. A report from CardRatings.com found that while the Fed lowered its benchmark rate, the average credit card rate fell by a much smaller margin, remaining over 24% for many. Experts note that card rates are influenced by various factors, including credit conditions and individual scores, not just the Fed's actions. For consumers carrying a balance, this means relief from high-cost debt is minimal, reinforcing the expense of revolving credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While debt settlement can be an effective strategy for reducing unsecured debts like credit card balances, many types of financial obligations do not qualify. This article explains that secured debts, such as mortgages and auto loans, are typically excluded because lenders can repossess the collateral. Other ineligible categories include federal student loans, tax debts owed to the IRS, child support, alimony, and court-ordered fines. For these types of debts, alternative solutions like government repayment plans, an Offer in Compromise with the IRS, or bankruptcy may be more appropriate avenues for relief.</p>

Essential aviation employees like TSA officers and air traffic controllers are currently working without pay, raising concerns about staffing and potential disruptions.

However, they also caution against assuming rates will continue to fall, as market conditions can change quickly.
