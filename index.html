          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand despite economic uncertainty. The denim company plans to absorb some of the initial costs from increased tariffs on goods from its key manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia. Executives expressed confidence in the brand's momentum and the resilience of its customer base, citing increased full-price sales and successful new product innovations. The positive forecast, which surpassed analyst expectations, caused the company's stock to rise significantly in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal U.S. resident, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration for wrongful imprisonment. Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian campus protests, was arrested in March and held in an immigration detention center for three months before being released. The claim alleges malicious prosecution, false arrest, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, arguing the actions were a form of political retaliation intended to suppress his First Amendment rights. The Department of Homeland Security has dismissed the claim as "absurd."</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents and protesters clashed during a large-scale raid at an agricultural farm in Ventura County, Southern California. Video footage showed agents, who were masked, using crowd control measures like irritants and pinning at least one individual to the ground. This incident was one of several recent immigration enforcement operations in the region, including another in nearby Carpinteria. The increase in federal activity has prompted local city officials to schedule meetings to address the community impact and response to the heightened enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is renewing its focus on the 2016 Russia investigation, with the Justice Department acknowledging inquiries into former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan. This development follows the declassification of a new CIA report, ordered by Director John Ratcliffe, which criticizes Brennan's handling of the 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference. Critics argue this is a politically motivated effort to weaponize the justice system against the administration's perceived adversaries, while supporters believe it addresses long-standing concerns about the origins of the probe.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of the Federal Reserve, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. OMB Director Russell Vought's letter to Powell focuses on a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters, alleging it is significantly over budget and features ostentatious elements. Vought suggests Powell may have misled Congress about the project's details and compliance with federal planning laws, raising questions about whether this could be used as grounds for removal. The Federal Reserve has declined to comment on the accusations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced plans for significant layoffs, affecting nearly 1,800 domestic employees, or about 15% of its staff. The move is part of a major restructuring effort to align the department with President Trump's "America First" foreign policy and eliminate what officials describe as redundant positions from the post-Cold War era. The restructuring will also merge or eliminate several hundred bureaus, including altering the mission of offices focused on refugee assistance to include facilitating deportations. Critics are concerned this will empower political appointees and undermine traditional diplomacy.</p>

This situation reflects a broader national trend where stable, well-paying jobs are becoming increasingly scarce.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza has killed at least 15 Palestinians, including eight children, who were waiting in line for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic, according to a local hospital. The U.S.-based aid group Project Hope, which runs the clinic, condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international law. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a Hamas operative and that the incident is under review, expressing regret for any harm to civilians. The attack underscores the extreme danger faced by Gazans seeking essential aid amid the ongoing conflict and ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Job search site Indeed and employer review platform Glassdoor are laying off a combined 1,300 workers, representing about 6% of the workforce of their parent company, Recruit Holdings. The CEO of the Japanese firm stated that the cuts are necessary as the company adapts to the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on the hiring industry. The layoffs will primarily affect research and development teams in the U.S. as Recruit Holdings aims to use AI to simplify hiring and reduce manual labor costs. As part of the restructuring, Glassdoor's operations will be integrated into Indeed.</p>

The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights is responding to a complaint from professors who allege that the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies give preferential treatment to certain racial groups, creating a hostile environment. This is the second federal probe targeting a major Virginia public university's DEI policies in recent weeks. If found in violation of civil rights law, GMU could risk losing its federal funding.</p>

          <p>As the only nation to have suffered a nuclear attack, Japan has long been a global advocate for disarmament. However, this national identity is being challenged by growing regional security threats, particularly the rapid nuclear buildups in China and North Korea. According to a new analysis, there is a growing fear that South Korea might pursue its own nuclear weapons, a development that could compel Japan to do the same. This potential proliferation cascade threatens to unravel decades of nonproliferation efforts and fundamentally alter the security landscape in East Asia.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump allocates approximately $170 billion for immigration enforcement, providing a massive funding increase for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This infusion of cash is intended to support the administration's planned mass deportation campaign. The law designates $45 billion to double ICE's detention capacity to over 100,000 beds and nearly $30 billion to hire more deportation officers and expand enforcement operations.

          <p>An administrative blunder in Los Angeles County has led to the accidental repeal of Measure J, a landmark 2020 ballot initiative that dedicates hundreds of millions of dollars to alternatives to incarceration. The error occurred when the county failed to codify Measure J into the county charter before voters approved Measure G, a separate government overhaul, in November 2024. As a result, the language of Measure G effectively overwrites and repeals Measure J, a mistake officials are only now discovering. Advocacy groups are alarmed, fearing the repeal will defund crucial social services and undermine the will of the voters.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the end of the mandatory shoe-screening requirement for all air travelers, a policy that has been in place for over two decades. The rule was implemented after the 2001 failed shoe-bomb attempt by Richard Reid. This article analyzes the policy change not as a result of new technology or intelligence, but as a form of "populism theater," giving the public a desired convenience. The author argues that while the original rule became security theater, its removal is a spectacle of a different kind, democratizing a perk previously reserved for premium travelers.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company X can move forward to trial. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X abruptly canceled a planned show partnership just hours after Lemon conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team plausibly alleged claims of fraud and the existence of an implied contract. The lawsuit stems from Musk's decision to terminate the deal following an interview where he was questioned on contentious topics, including his amplification of bigoted tropes.</p>

Instead, they are considering actions permitted under Brazil's Reciprocity Law, such as suspending U.S. patents or taxing profits.
