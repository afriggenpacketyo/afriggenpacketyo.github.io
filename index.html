          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that a wide range of global tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump are illegal, challenging a key tool of his foreign and economic policy. The 7-4 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that the tariffs were not authorized under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating this power belongs to Congress. The ruling's implementation is delayed to allow for a potential appeal to the Supreme Court, leaving the immediate impact on international trade uncertain.</p>

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms in London was temporarily halted by pro-Palestinian protesters. The group, identifying as Jewish Artists for Palestine, claimed responsibility, citing objections to what they term "Zionist funding" and complicity in the Gaza conflict by the orchestra and the BBC. The orchestra resumed its performance after security removed the demonstrators, though the incident caused a significant delay and drew a mixed reaction from the audience.</p>

Health officials believe the patient, who has since been hospitalized and discharged, was likely exposed to the bacterial disease while camping in Rio Arriba County. The case serves as a public health reminder to take precautions, such as avoiding contact with wild rodents and using insect repellent, as the disease can be transmitted by infected fleas.</p>

          <p>China is restructuring its national laboratory system to more directly serve its strategic agenda of achieving scientific and technological supremacy. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by the Minister of Science and Technology, highlighted the new model for these labs, which involves clear mandates and centralized funding from Beijing. This shift moves away from loosely defined research, instead focusing the labs, including those in Hong Kong, on supporting national development and innovation priorities.</p>

          <p>Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move prompted by President Donald Trump. The goal is to create a map that favors Republicans, potentially turning a Kansas City area Democratic seat into a GOP-held one and increasing the party's U.S. House majority. This action is part of a broader, controversial national push by Republicans to engage in mid-decade redistricting, sparking concerns about gerrymandering and political power grabs.</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced the removal of 138 asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was sought by the local council following protests, but the appellate court deemed the ruling "seriously flawed," citing a failure to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The decision allows the asylum seekers to stay pending a full hearing, highlighting the legal and social tensions surrounding asylum accommodations in the UK.</p>

          <p>The new Darren Aronofsky film "Caught Stealing," starring Austin Butler, is a crime comedy set in a grungy 1998 New York City that prioritizes style over substance. The movie follows a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld, but the plot and characters are described as cartoonish and underdeveloped. While the film successfully evokes the atmosphere of a bygone era and features notable cameo appearances, it ultimately falls short of classic New York crime thrillers, feeling more like a disposable rental from the period it depicts.</p>

          <p>A couple whose baby was stillborn has revealed they discovered their daughter's body lying on a sofa at the funeral director's private home, not in the chapel of rest as they believed. The funeral director, Amie Upton, has since been banned from Leeds hospital mortuaries for keeping the bodies of babies at her residence. The parents, Cody and Liam Townend, described the experience as mortifying and said their daughter was "robbed of her dignity," adding their voice to calls for stricter regulation of the UK's funeral industry.</p>

          <p>While the FBI has labeled the Minneapolis Catholic church shooting a hate-motivated attack, extremism analysts suggest the shooter's online materials paint a more complicated picture. The writings and videos from the perpetrator, Robin Westman, contain a chaotic mix of right-wing, left-wing, and antisemitic references, alongside an obsession with past mass killers from various backgrounds. Experts believe this aligns with a trend of misanthropic attackers who are not driven by a coherent ideology but by a desire for notoriety within online subcultures that glorify violence.</p>

          <p>Meta is implementing temporary changes to its AI chatbot policies for teenagers in response to a Senate investigation and concerns about inappropriate conversations. The company will now train its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to steer clear of romantic discussions, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows reports that Meta's internal guidelines permitted "sensual" conversations with minors, prompting criticism from lawmakers and advocacy groups who argue the system needs a fundamental safety-focused rebuild.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to remove almost 700 unaccompanied migrant children from Guatemala, according to a letter from Senator Ron Wyden citing whistleblower information. The Guatemalan government has stated it is prepared to receive the children, but Wyden argues the move would violate the U.S.'s child welfare mandate and legal obligations. The plan is described as forcibly removing children who lack a sponsor or an active asylum case, thrusting them back into the dangerous conditions they fled.</p>
