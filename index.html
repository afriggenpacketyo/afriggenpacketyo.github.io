          <p>China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% drop in May compared to the previous year, marking the most substantial decline since last October. This data indicates that Beijing's economic stimulus measures may not be effectively boosting corporate profitability. Despite this, other economic indicators like retail sales have shown growth, leading to a mixed economic outlook. Economists suggest this might reduce the urgency for further stimulus, as overall GDP growth is currently tracking above the official government target. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit argues that the family's detention and expedited removal violate their constitutional rights, as they were previously paroled into the country and deemed not to be a flight risk.

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) after more than four decades as the face of critical Windows system errors. The change is part of a broader effort to improve system resilience, partly in response to the major 2024 Crowdstrike IT outage. The new error screen will feature a black background and a more simplified message, aiming to make unexpected restarts less jarring for users. This updated user interface is scheduled to roll out with the Windows 11 (version 24H2) update later this summer.</p>

          <p>In the sex trafficking trial of Sean Combs, federal prosecutors delivered closing arguments, asserting that the music mogul used "violence, power and fear" to run a criminal enterprise. The prosecution's case centers on the testimony of two ex-girlfriends who alleged they were coerced into participating in filmed sexual encounters, known as "freak-offs." Prosecutors highlighted key evidence, including hotel security footage of Combs assaulting Cassie Ventura, arguing it was part of a broader pattern of abuse intended to ensure compliance. The government contends that Combs and his inner circle conspired to facilitate and conceal these crimes for years.</p>

The pause applies to country-specific tariffs under the administration's reciprocal trade framework but does not affect the baseline 10% duty on global imports. This development comes as Japan's top negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, with Japan particularly concerned about the high tariffs imposed on its automotive industry.

          <p>A classified intelligence briefing on the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has left senators with starkly different conclusions, largely split by party. Republican allies of President Trump, like Senator Lindsey Graham, endorsed the administration's claim that the sites were "obliterated," setting Iran's program back years. In contrast, Democrats like Senator Chris Murphy accused the president of misleading the public, stating the briefing provided no coherent strategy and that significant Iranian capabilities remain. The deep division highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding the military action, which was authorized without prior congressional approval.</p>

          <p>A large, bright meteor, also known as a fireball, streaked across the sky over the southeastern U.S. before exploding above Georgia. NASA reported that the meteor, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weighing over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. It disintegrated at an altitude of 27 miles, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT and creating a pressure wave that resulted in audible booms on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 sightings of the rare daylight event from observers in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>

The initiative, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures are designed to cool dense urban areas that can be up to 20 degrees hotter than greener neighborhoods. This project serves as a real-world laboratory for strategies that could be replicated in other cities facing rising temperatures due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Business owners across the U.S. are expressing concern that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown is beginning to harm their workforce and the broader economy. Immigrants now represent a record high share of the U.S. labor force, and businesses in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction report losing valuable, authorized workers due to shifting policies. Economists warn that reducing the immigrant workforce could slow economic growth, fuel inflation, and create labor shortages. The policies are creating fear and uncertainty even for those with legal work permits, disrupting lives and businesses alike. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The lead police investigator in the UK's Post Office scandal has indicated that criminal trials may not commence until 2028, causing frustration for victims seeking accountability. The investigation, which began in 2020, is meticulously examining millions of documents related to the faulty Horizon IT system that led to the wrongful prosecution of over 900 sub-postmasters. While police have identified numerous potential suspects, they will not hand files to prosecutors until the public inquiry publishes its final report later this year. Victims express a desire for justice but also understand the need for a thorough investigation.</p>
