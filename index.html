          <p>A growing alignment between US tech executives and the 'Make America Great Again' movement is pushing for a hardline stance against China, particularly in containing its technological development. This article explores the formation of this "uneasy alliance," noting the rise of interventionist "tech hawks" who are deepening ties with the defense sector. However, analysts warn that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the political camp could cause this coalition to backfire, potentially undermining the effectiveness of their shared goal to reshape US-China policy.</p>

          <p>Evacuation orders have been issued for parts of Grand Canyon National Park due to two large, uncontained wildfires sparked by lightning. The Dragon Bravo Fire within the park and the larger White Sage Fire to the north have burned thousands of acres, forcing the evacuation of all North Rim residents and visitors. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and rugged terrain, reflecting the heightened risk of wildfires across the hot and dry western United States.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year is expanding, bringing soaring temperatures to Scotland and Northern Ireland, with predictions of the warmest day of the year for Scotland. Across England and Wales, amber heat health alerts remain in effect, warning of risks to the entire population and causing disruptions to events like Wimbledon. The extreme heat has also prompted wildfire warnings and led to hosepipe bans, underscoring the growing impact of climate change on weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior talent, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing and compensation. This move does not involve an investment in Windsurf but grants Google a nonexclusive license to its technology, allowing the startup to remain independent. The acquisition highlights the escalating "talent war" in the artificial intelligence sector, as major companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft compete fiercely for top-tier expertise.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a significant backlash over its recent collection. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their cultural origins, sparking a social media outcry. In response, the company engaged with an Indian commerce chamber representing the artisans to explore respectful collaboration, a move seen as a positive step in addressing cultural appropriation in fashion.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle Prague's historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge has ignited a fierce debate between modernization and preservation. The authority insists a new, three-track bridge is essential for expanding rail capacity, while a coalition of architects, heritage experts, and UNESCO argues the iconic steel structure can and should be repaired. The controversy has become a flashpoint in the city, highlighting the classic urban dilemma of balancing transportation needs with the protection of cultural landmarks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 civil service and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan under the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce the department's workforce by 15% and consolidate or eliminate numerous offices. The layoffs have heavily affected bureaus focused on human rights, refugee admissions, and foreign assistance, prompting sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and diplomats who warn the move weakens U.S. national security and foreign policy.</p>

In a letter, the Office of Management and Budget questioned the project's costs and suggested the Fed may have violated the law by altering plans without proper approval. This criticism represents a new front in the administration's public pressure campaign against Powell, which has primarily focused on President Trump's demands for lower interest rates.
