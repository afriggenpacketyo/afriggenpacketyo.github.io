          <p>A man accused of killing his three young daughters is confirmed dead after his remains were found in a remote wooded area in Washington. DNA testing identified the remains as Travis Decker, a former soldier who disappeared after the May murders, sparking a monthslong manhunt. With his death confirmed, prosecutors are moving to drop all charges, bringing what the local sheriff described as "a close to this dark chapter." Due to the condition of the remains, the coroner stated that the exact cause and manner of Decker's death may never be known.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for Microsoft to fire Lisa Monaco, a company executive who previously served as deputy attorney general in the Biden administration. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump labeled Monaco a "menace to U.S. National Security," referencing the recent stripping of her security clearances. The demand comes as Microsoft holds major government contracts for its cloud infrastructure and software services. Microsoft has declined to comment on the president's statement regarding its employee.</p>

According to officials, Hegseth will personally deliver his message on restoring the "warrior ethos" to the military and will present new standards to achieve this goal. The rare event, which brings together officers from command positions around the world, has raised questions about the significant travel costs and security requirements involved.

          <p>A new report indicates that Jason Hedberg, the husband of New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill, was also involved in the 1994 U.S. Naval Academy cheating scandal. This follows the recent revelation that Sherrill herself was disciplined for failing to report cheating classmates, which prevented her from participating in her graduation ceremony. The race has become increasingly contentious, with Sherrill's campaign accusing her opponent of illegally obtaining her private military records, a claim the opponent's campaign denies while demanding she release her full records.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid that had been previously approved by Congress. In a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, the justices sided with the administration, which had appealed a lower court's order to release the funds. President Trump is utilizing a rare authority known as a "pocket rescission" to freeze the funds near the end of the fiscal year. The court's dissenting justices criticized the ruling for being made on an emergency basis with limited briefing and no oral arguments.</p>

          <p>A suspect has been identified in the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop in Austin, Texas, according to an original investigator on the case. The suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer and rapist, who was linked to the crime through DNA evidence. The case has remained a haunting cold case for over three decades and previously involved the wrongful convictions of two men whose charges were later dropped when DNA found at the scene did not match them. Brashers died by suicide in 1999 during a standoff with police.</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's persistent public attacks against James Comey could complicate the prosecution's case against the former FBI Director. Comey's defense is expected to argue for dismissal based on selective or vindictive prosecution, using the president's years of critical comments as evidence of political animus. The indictment was secured shortly after Trump installed a loyalist with no prosecutorial experience to lead the U.S. Attorney's office handling the case, following internal disagreement among career prosecutors about whether to press charges. This unusual context may bolster the defense's claims in court.</p>

With South Korea and China hosting APEC consecutively, the forum presents a key opportunity for the nations to mediate and build consensus on regional cooperation and security issues.</p>

          <h2>Pentagon Confirms Medals of Honor for Soldiers in Wounded Knee Massacre Will Not Be Revoked</h2>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that the Medals of Honor awarded to 20 U.S. soldiers for their actions during the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre will not be rescinded. The decision, which Hegseth declared final, follows a Pentagon review and reverses a push from lawmakers and Native American groups to revoke the awards. Critics characterize the historical event as a massacre of hundreds of unarmed Lakota people, not a battle. This move is seen by some historians as part of a broader Trump administration effort to reinterpret controversial events in American history.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, made public by Congressional Democrats, contain references to billionaire Elon Musk and the UK's Prince Andrew. The files, turned over by the Epstein estate, include an itinerary note about a potential visit by Musk to Epstein's private island in 2014. A separate flight manifest from May 2000 lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on a flight with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Both men have previously denied wrongdoing or minimized their association with Epstein, and the records do not suggest they were aware of his criminal activities.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes the ideology behind Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health initiatives, framing them as part of a conservative-leaning movement that venerates the past. The piece argues that Kennedy's skepticism towards modern pharmacology, including vaccines, stems from a belief that human health and happiness lie in a more "natural" past, free from industrial and medical interventions. This perspective has found a receptive audience among those whose trust in institutions like the CDC eroded during the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a self-sustaining movement that questions established medical consensus.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast station owners Sinclair and Nexstar have announced they will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC affiliate stations. The move comes after the companies preempted the late-night show for nearly a week, even after ABC had reinstated it following a temporary suspension. The controversy stemmed from comments Kimmel made about the alleged murder of a conservative activist. In their statements, both companies emphasized their responsibility as local broadcasters and denied that their decisions were influenced by any government pressure, asserting their right to exercise judgment over their content.</p>

          <p>The 79-year-old owner of a Los Angeles car wash, who is a U.S. citizen, is seeking $50 million in damages from the federal government after he was allegedly slammed to the ground and wrongfully detained by immigration agents. Rafie Ollah Shouhed claims he suffered broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury during an ICE raid where masked agents entered his business. His attorney states the agents acted with reckless cruelty, detaining him for nearly 12 hours without charge despite knowing his citizenship status, as part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement operations in the region.</p>

The operation, part of President Trump's initiative to crack down on crime in the city, will also involve 300 state troopers and National Guard troops in support roles. The move has been described by the governor as a "generational opportunity" to address crime, though it comes amid accusations that the Trump administration is unfairly targeting Democratic-led cities with such federal interventions.</p>

          <p>A group of hackers is threatening to publish more private information of nursery school children unless a ransom is paid by the Kido nursery chain. The criminals have already posted profiles of 20 children, including pictures and personal details, and have also leaked data of dozens of employees. The breach occurred through a third-party software service used by the nursery, and some parents have reported receiving threatening phone calls from the hackers. While the Metropolitan Police are investigating, a former cybersecurity chief has described the criminals' actions as "absolutely horrible" but urged calm.</p>
