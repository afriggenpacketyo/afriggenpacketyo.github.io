          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, has been fired by the Department of Justice. Comey recently led the prosecution against Sean "Diddy" Combs and previously secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell. As the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired, sources suggest her dismissal may have been influenced by political motivations from the White House. The U.S. Attorney's Office and the Justice Department have not commented on the developing situation.</p>

          <p>Former ESPN host Samantha Ponder has spoken out about the circumstances leading to her firing, linking it to her public support for female athletes competing against transgender women. Ponder stated that after sharing stories and expressing her views, she received warnings from top ESPN executives who were uncomfortable with her commentary. She believes that while other factors may have been involved, the timing of her dismissal was almost certainly tied to her posts about the issue. Ponder expressed no bitterness, feeling it was time to leave and that she should have been more courageous in speaking up sooner.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has been halted in the House of Representatives due to unexpected opposition from a bloc of conservative Republicans. Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, disagreements over changes to the legislation prevented it from moving forward. The stalemate casts doubt on the Republican conference's ability to unify on crypto policy and marks a setback for the industry during what was promoted as "Crypto Week." Leadership is now reportedly considering alternative strategies to pass some measures, such as a ban on a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

Michelle Obama reiterated her commitment to their marriage, explaining her recent absences from public events as a personal choice to enjoy her newfound freedom.

          <p>President Trump's fundraising for his future presidential library is facing criticism over a lack of transparency, prompting Senate Democrats to propose new regulatory legislation. The bill, introduced by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, aims to cap donations and require public disclosure, citing concerns that special interests could use contributions to gain influence. This move was spurred by large, opaque donations to the Trump library, including a Boeing 747 from Qatar and multimillion-dollar legal settlements. The proposed rules address a long-standing issue of unregulated fundraising that has also faced past presidents.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially triggering a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory. The quake occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, prompting coastal communities to heed evacuation alerts. Officials confirmed that a small tsunami was generated but did not expect widespread, destructive waves, as the event happened in shallow water. The region is part of the seismically active "Ring of Fire," and the event serves as a reminder of the area's geological volatility.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are cautioning that an attempt by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would create significant market instability and legal chaos. Despite Trump's public denial of an imminent firing, his persistent criticism over interest rate policy has fueled speculation, with a White House official reportedly confirming the President's intent. Experts believe such a move would be challenged in court, with the Supreme Court potentially deciding the outcome, and would undermine the crucial independence of the central bank. The uncertainty alone could trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. (not investment advice)</p>

This reversal on a topic that deeply resonates with his base—distrust of elites and government cover-ups—cuts to the core of his political appeal. Unlike other policy shifts, this issue directly challenges his self-portrayal as an anti-establishment truth-teller, potentially causing a lasting schism with his most ardent followers.

          <p>More than 20 children have been placed in the custody of child-welfare services in California as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple. The investigation began after an infant in their care was hospitalized with a traumatic head injury, allegedly caused by a nanny. Authorities discovered the couple were the legal parents to over 20 children, most born via different surrogates who have since claimed they were misled and unaware of the scale of the operation. The couple, Silvia Zhang and Guojun Xuan, were arrested in May, and the FBI is now involved in the complex case.</p>

          <p>As the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans finalizes a settlement plan for 633 clergy abuse claims, investors are arguing that nearly half of these claims could be invalidated. The church has agreed to a settlement trust of at least $180 million, but the eligibility of many claims filed after court deadlines or involving duplicate entries is now being questioned. If a large number of claims are thrown out, it could jeopardize the entire settlement, as a two-thirds approval vote from claimants is required. The outcome will determine whether the archdiocese exits its five-year bankruptcy or faces individual lawsuits from victims.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent dismissal of the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a "hoax" contrasts sharply with his previous statements on the matter, creating backlash among his supporters. Over the years, Trump has shifted from calling Epstein a "terrific guy" to distancing himself and suggesting Epstein may have been killed in jail. During his 2024 campaign, he pledged to release the Epstein files, a promise his administration now appears to be retracting by claiming no "client list" exists. This timeline highlights the president's evolving and often contradictory rhetoric on a case that continues to fuel conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has demonstrated that creating embryos with DNA from three people can successfully prevent devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. Researchers reported that eight children, born using this technique to families plagued by these rare genetic conditions, appear healthy. The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, effectively replacing the defective genetic material. While the results are hailed as a major breakthrough, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of germline genetic modification.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Beijing is making "big steps" to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This marks a significant shift in tone from his previous statements, where he has directly blamed China for the crisis and used it as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump's comments come amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. He suggested that China is motivated to act, in part, because of the economic pressure from the tariffs he has implemented.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported five migrants from various countries to Eswatini, a small African nation with a troubling human rights record. This action signals a ramp-up of "third country" deportations, a controversial practice where migrants are sent to nations other than their own, particularly if their home countries refuse to accept them. The Department of Homeland Security stated the deported men were convicted of serious crimes. However, the move has drawn condemnation, as Eswatini's government is known for arbitrary killings and torture, raising alarm about the safety and rights of those being sent there.</p>

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, making them less volatile and more suitable for payments. Supported by the crypto industry and the Trump administration, the legislation would establish consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. Proponents argue that regulation would foster innovation and allow for faster, lower-cost financial transactions. (not investment advice)</p>
