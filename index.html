        <h2>DOJ Blocks Testimony in Case of Mass Federal Firings</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:48:53 EDT</div>

        <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) refused to allow the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Charles Ezell, to testify about the mass firing of probationary federal employees.  A federal judge had ordered Ezell's testimony to investigate allegations that the firings were ordered by OPM and falsely attributed to performance issues. The DOJ's refusal to cooperate increases the likelihood of the Trump administration losing the case.  The judge expressed skepticism that the firings were not centrally directed by OPM.</p>

        <h2>California Considers Raising Wages for Inmate Firefighters</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:27:59 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>California lawmakers are considering legislation (AB 247) to significantly raise the hourly wages of inmate firefighters.  Currently, these inmates earn very low daily wages despite working dangerous conditions battling wildfires.  Advocates argue the higher wages are justified given the risks and the inmates' contributions to firefighting efforts.  Opposition exists from the California State Sheriffsâ€™ Assn. due to potential fiscal strain on counties.</p>

        <p>The House passed a spending bill to avert a government shutdown, but the bill now faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where it requires 60 votes to pass.  Senate Democrats are deeply divided on how to proceed, facing a difficult choice between voting for a bill they oppose or risking a government shutdown. The bill cuts non-defense spending while increasing military and veterans' healthcare funding.  The situation is complicated by the potential for a shutdown under the Trump administration.</p>
