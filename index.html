          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI, resulting in one death and four injuries. The blast, which occurred on North Indian Canyon Drive, caused significant damage to nearby buildings and prompted evacuations in the surrounding area. Authorities have identified a person of interest and are conducting a widespread investigation, with the FBI and ATF sending agents to assist. The clinic confirmed that staff and stored embryos were unharmed. The incident is being treated as one of the largest bombing investigations in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the UK government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws regarding the use of artists' content for AI development. He labeled the government "absolute losers" and expressed feeling "incredibly betrayed" by the proposals, arguing they would rob young artists of income and legacy. This follows the government's rejection of House of Lords amendments aimed at ensuring copyright holders' permission for AI use of their work. Sir Elton warned of potential legal action and urged Prime Minister Starmer to address the issue, while industry executives fear the plans could sacrifice the UK music industry to benefit tech giants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a broader slowdown in luxury spending, wealthy shoppers continue to splurge on high-end jewelry, but are becoming increasingly selective, favoring top brands. This trend benefits Swiss luxury group Richemont, known for its prestigious jewelry brands like Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier. Richemont reported strong fourth-quarter sales, driven by an 11% growth in its Jewellery Maisons division. According to Bernstein's Luca Solca, Richemont's jewelry brands maintain a leading position in consumer desirability, despite efforts from competitors like LVMH to challenge this dominance.

          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-total darkness during the day. The National Weather Service issued dust storm warnings, a first for Chicago, as visibility dropped to less than a quarter-mile in minutes. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dust from exceptionally dry soil. Such storms, known as haboobs, are more common in desert regions, making this event particularly unusual for the area.</p>

          <p>A recent military clash between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack, highlights India's ongoing struggle to manage its relationship with its neighbor, impeding its aspirations as a major diplomatic and economic power. Despite India's military strength, achieving a decisive victory against Pakistan is nearly impossible due to the threat of nuclear escalation. The conflict diverts resources and attention from India's broader strategic goals, particularly its focus on countering China. The situation is further complicated by religious nationalism in both countries and increasing involvement from global powers.</p>

Despite the uneven outing, manager Dave Roberts noted positive signs, including increased velocity, but acknowledged Kershaw's command was inconsistent.

          <p>Simon Tisdall discusses the increasing challenges to international law, with leaders like Putin evading justice and powerful states rejecting international jurisdiction. The establishment of the Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine is unlikely to lead to Putin's swift trial due to his immunity as a head of state and the lack of universal support for international law. The author argues that the post-1945 global order, based on international law, is collapsing as principles are flouted and undermined, leading to moral confusion among political leaders and a breakdown in peaceful coexistence.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that the Trump family's blatant profiteering from foreign entities is not an isolated phenomenon, but rather a continuation of a long-standing pattern of American politicians leveraging their positions for personal gain. The article highlights instances of the Trump family engaging in deals with kleptocratic regimes, selling access to the administration, and pursuing lucrative foreign investments. Michel contends that this behavior mirrors past instances of corruption, such as Hunter Biden's dealings and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign donations. The author calls for legislative reforms to prevent future abuses and ensure accountability for those who exploit public office for personal enrichment.</p>

Richards advocates for greater investment in rail infrastructure to foster community, connection, and a more sustainable future, highlighting the success of high-speed rail in countries like China as a model for America to follow.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions in the Middle East, including engaging with Syria's leader and pursuing deals with Gulf states, indicate a shift away from prioritizing Israel in American foreign policy. This approach contrasts with previous administrations, where Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu played a central role in regional diplomacy. While the U.S. maintains its ties with Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating with Iran, pursuing business deals with Gulf nations, and sidelining Netanyahu on key issues like the Gaza conflict signal a new dynamic in the region.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's attempts to improve relations between the UK and the European Union are facing strong opposition from the British news media, despite public opinion favoring closer ties. Pro-Brexit media outlets are criticizing Starmer's efforts, labeling the upcoming summit with EU leaders a "surrender." This media resistance reflects the ongoing divisions over Brexit and the challenges Starmer faces in navigating the political landscape while trying to strengthen Britain's relationship with Europe amid global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, highlighted by a summit in London expected to yield a defense pact and relaxed trade rules. This rapprochement is driven by President Trump's America, whose shift away from global leadership on defense and free trade has prompted both partners to address shared challenges. Despite lingering disputes over fishing rights and youth travel, the summit underscores a commitment to working together in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. This new relationship signifies a strategic realignment in response to America's changing role on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasing efforts to recruit women into its armed forces to address a shortage of soldiers, but faces challenges due to persistent sexism.

Despite the government's efforts to promote gender equality, deeply rooted stereotypes and marginalization persist, requiring a shift in attitudes and practices to fully integrate women into combat roles.</p>

          <p>High demand for live shows in China is driving a trend of "concert tourism," where fans travel across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel stays, dining, and tourist attractions to boost domestic consumption. This strategy aligns with Beijing's focus on increasing domestic spending amid trade tensions. Shily Zhou, a Shanghai resident, traveled twice in five months to see her favorite singer, benefiting from discounts on tourist sites offered with her concert ticket.</p>

          <p>A rare clue, bloody bare footprints, at a Minneapolis crime scene led to a decades-long search for answers in the murder of Jeanie Childs. The investigation, which began in 1993, saw investigators compare the footprints to multiple suspects before new DNA technology identified Jerry Westrom as a potential match. Despite Westrom's denial, forensic analysis confirmed his DNA at the scene and his footprints matched those in the apartment.

Offenders would not receive wages, but the money earned would be directed to a fund for victims' groups. This initiative aims to address prison overcrowding and ensure that punishment is more than just a "slap on the wrist."</p>
