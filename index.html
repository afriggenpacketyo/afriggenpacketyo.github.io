          <p>A U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet rolled off an aircraft carrier and sank into the Red Sea due to human error during towing operations. While being moved out of the hangar bay of the USS Harry S. Truman, the crew lost control of the aircraft and tow tractor, leading to the incident. Both crew members involved were able to escape, with only one sustaining a minor injury. An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause, although initial reports suggest possible influence from Houthi fire, and the Truman carrier was previously involved in a collision earlier this year.

          <p>A Senate Democratic committee report suggests Elon Musk may be avoiding over $2 billion in potential financial liabilities by leveraging his influence over the federal government. The report claims Musk's actions, supported by President Trump, have gutted agencies and purged the federal workforce, allowing him to evade oversight and derail investigations. On Trump's inauguration day, Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, faced numerous regulatory or enforcement actions totaling billions in potential liability. Democrats accuse Musk of manipulating the system to his advantage as he prepares to step back from his DOGE work. Optimism score is 50.</p>

The blackout halted trains, cut phone service, and shut down traffic lights, impacting major cities like Madrid and Lisbon. Spanish officials attributed the outage to a 'strong oscillation' in the European grid, while Portuguese officials cited a rare atmospheric phenomenon. Power was gradually restored throughout the day, with assistance from Morocco and France. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly targeting unaccompanied immigrant children for deportation or criminal prosecution, raising concerns about 'backdoor family separation'. ICE is conducting 'welfare checks' on these children, ostensibly to ensure their safety, but an internal document reveals that the agency is also gathering intelligence to assess deportation viability and potential criminal activity. Legal services for unaccompanied minors have been cut, and sensitive data is being shared with ICE, leading to fears of increased trauma and a climate of fear for immigrant families.

          <p>Damian Lillard of the Milwaukee Bucks is feared to have torn his left Achilles tendon, potentially sidelining him for most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season. The injury occurred during a playoff game against the Indiana Pacers. Lillard had recently returned after recovering from a blood clot. Coach Rivers expressed sympathy, calling the injury 'tough'. Lillard is under contract with the Bucks through the 2025-26 season, with a player option for 2026-27. Optimism score is 15.</p>
