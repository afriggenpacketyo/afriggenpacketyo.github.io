          <p>An Antonov An-24 passenger plane operated by Angara Airlines has crashed in Russia's far east, with no survivors among the 48 people on board. The aging, nearly 50-year-old aircraft disappeared from radar during its approach to Tynda in the Amur region. Russian authorities have launched an investigation, with initial reports suggesting bad weather may have been a factor, while also noting the growing challenges for Russia's aviation sector due to Western sanctions impacting the availability of spare parts.</p>

No injuries were reported, and commercial airport operations were not disrupted. This incident follows another recent precautionary landing by a U.S. Osprey in Japan and comes after a fatal crash in 2023 that grounded the fleet for months, keeping the aircraft's safety record under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has paused its monetary easing cycle, keeping interest rates steady at 2% after a series of eight cuts over the past year. The decision was widely expected as policymakers adopt a "wait and watch" approach amid significant economic uncertainty, particularly concerning potential new US trade tariffs. While inflation has returned to the bank's 2% target, officials indicated no urgency for further adjustments, awaiting clarity on the future of transatlantic trade relations.

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed he is launching a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a joint statement, they called for a "real, democratic alternative" and invited supporters to a founding conference. The new party is expected to position itself to the left of Labour, advocating for wealth redistribution, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel, potentially splitting the left-wing vote in future elections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders as part of an "American AI Action Plan," which includes a directive to prevent the use of "woke AI" in the federal government. The order targets models perceived to have ideological agendas, specifically citing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives as "destructive." The plan also aims to remove regulatory hurdles to spur AI innovation and establish a program to promote the export of U.S. AI technology, framing the issue as a key part of his administration's policy focus.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified additional documents related to the 2016 election, claiming they show Obama-era officials "manufactured" intelligence to undermine Donald Trump. The release, a 2020 report by House Republicans, discusses sensitive intelligence from human and signal sources, prompting sharp criticism from Democrats and former officials who warn it could compromise sources and methods. Democrats dispute Gabbard's characterization of the findings, accusing her of politicizing intelligence and misrepresenting the information.</p>

          <p>An arrest has been made in a four-decade-old cold case involving the murder and sexual assault of two teenagers in Northern California. In 1984, 18-year-old Terrance Arndt was shot and killed, and his female companion was sexually assaulted. Using forensic genetic genealogy, investigators identified Roger Neil Schmidt Sr., 64, as the suspect after matching his DNA to evidence from the scene. Schmidt, who lived in the area at the time of the crime, was arrested in Arizona.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission is re-verifying the records of nearly 80 million registered voters in the state of Bihar ahead of elections, a move that has sparked fears of disenfranchisement.

          <p>This analysis asserts that China is unwilling to fully crack down on the export of fentanyl precursors because it views the issue as a source of political leverage over the United States. While Beijing has shown it can control the trade when incentivized, such as after the imposition of U.S. tariffs, its cooperation has been inconsistent and dependent on the broader state of U.S.-China relations. The article argues that despite the devastating human cost in America, Chinese leaders withhold full cooperation to extract concessions, treating the crisis as a strategic tool.</p>

This may be a more realistic and evidence-based target for many people than the popular but unscientific 10,000-step goal, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign. Researchers found that for most conditions, the health benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps, encouraging a more achievable goal for improving public health.</p>
