          <p>A 13-year-old boy from North Canton tragically died after falling from a Memorial Day parade float in Green, Ohio. The incident occurred during the parade when the teen, riding on a trailer pulled by a pickup truck, fell off and was run over by the trailer's tires, sustaining severe injuries. Fire personnel responded immediately, but the boy was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The Summit County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident, which they have called a "tragic accident," and the parade was immediately ended out of respect for the boy and his family.</p>

Private enterprises showed the highest growth rate, while state-owned enterprises saw a decline in profits. While this data provides an initial look at the health of China's industrial profits since the escalating tariff war with the US, uncertainty remains regarding the future impact of the trade relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to spread soil collected from near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on the grounds of the prime minister's office and other government buildings. This effort aims to alleviate concerns regarding the soil's safety and demonstrate its suitability for public works projects. The soil, collected after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, retains low-level radioactivity, but the government intends to show that it meets safety standards. The soil will be used in flowerbeds and for other purposes on government office grounds, marking the first time it has been repurposed outside Fukushima Prefecture.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen spoke about his decision to donate $20,000 to the families of striking miners in the UK during a 1985 concert in Newcastle. Springsteen said he followed news coverage of the strike and felt it was the right thing to do, as his parents were working-class people who struggled throughout their lives. The donation was made to the Northumberland and Durham Miners' Support Group, and the women who received the check described Springsteen as a hero who acted out of genuine concern, not for publicity.</p>

          <p>A plan to build 153 new homes in the historic village of Maids Moreton in England is facing opposition due to the local sewage works already being over capacity.

In the recording, the police officer questioned whether the arrest was "the best for Nicola" and acknowledged that criminalizing abortions is a sensitive area for law enforcement.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, has returned home to Tehran. Panahi's winning film, *It Was Just Accident*, depicts torture in Iranian jails. His return follows multiple imprisonments in Iran and a 15-year absence from Cannes due to a travel ban. Panahi's win has sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials, with France praising the film as a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime.</p>

          <p>High-end jewellery designers are incorporating subtle, hidden details into their pieces, transforming them into personal narratives and symbols of memory and artistry. Swiss jewellery house GÃ¼belin incorporates rubies into less visible areas of their creations, while other houses like Van Cleef & Arpels use techniques like the Mystery Setting to conceal metal and create seamless surfaces. Designers are also incorporating personal elements like hair and wood into their pieces, offering wearers a private connection to their jewellery and a reminder that true beauty lives beneath the surface.</p>
