          <p>Jamie Hepburn, a minister in the Scottish government, has resigned from his position after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The incident reportedly occurred when Hepburn grabbed Ross's shoulder and used aggressive language following a parliamentary debate. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that regardless of whether he breached the Ministerial Code, he felt his actions did not align with his own personal standards. First Minister John Swinney accepted the resignation with regret, acknowledging it as a departure from Hepburn's usual respectful conduct.</p>

          <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that athletes from Russia will be permitted to participate in the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Games as neutral competitors. This decision maintains the sanctions imposed for the Paris 2024 Summer Games, meaning athletes cannot use the Russian flag or anthem. To qualify, athletes must undergo a vetting process to ensure they have no connections to the Russian military or have not actively supported the war in Ukraine. This policy continues the IOC's response to both the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and previous state-sponsored doping scandals.</p>

Following the discussion, Trump stated he would visit China early next year and that the two leaders would also meet at the upcoming APEC Summit in South Korea. The conversation aimed to finalize a framework agreement that would resolve the fate of the popular social media app, which faces a potential ban in the U.S. due to a law requiring its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest.</p>

          <p>A recently appointed CDC advisory panel unexpectedly reversed its course on key vaccine recommendations during a contentious two-day meeting. The committee, known as ACIP, decided to postpone indefinitely a vote on a controversial proposal to delay the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns. Additionally, the panel overturned a decision it had made just a day earlier regarding insurance coverage for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) shot. The surprising moves highlight the divisions and inexperience of the new panel, handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., creating uncertainty around U.S. immunization policy.</p>

Despite his optimism for Boeing, Cramer warned that rising 10-year Treasury yields pose a significant risk to the broader market, potentially hindering stock performance. He also commented on the technology sector, noting that Nvidia's new collaboration with Intel is a strategic win that expands its presence in the enterprise data center market, a traditional stronghold for Intel.

          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated a widely criticized plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein in 2008, appeared before the House Oversight Committee for a closed-door deposition. Acosta, who later served as Labor Secretary under President Trump, faced questions regarding the leniency of the agreement, which has been described as a "sweetheart deal." Committee Chairman James Comer stated that the deposition would be hard-hitting, as lawmakers seek to understand why Epstein was not prosecuted more aggressively despite numerous warnings about his criminal activities.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that the recent $100 price increase for the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not connected to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the company's flagship New York store, Cook emphasized that Apple has managed to avoid passing tariff costs on to consumers by shifting its supply chain. The company has increasingly been importing iPhones for the U.S. market from countries with lower tariffs, such as India and Vietnam, rather than primarily from China.</p>

          <p>Baseball fans hoping to watch what may be Clayton Kershaw's final start at Dodger Stadium on traditional television will be unable to do so. The game, featuring the legendary pitcher who recently announced his retirement, will be broadcast exclusively on Apple TV+. This is part of a broader agreement between Major League Baseball and the streaming service for a package of exclusive Friday night games. This arrangement means that even the Dodgers' own regional sports network, SportsNet LA, is blacked out from airing the potentially historic event.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, providing key details for workers and tax professionals. The new rule allows certain employees to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their taxable income annually from 2025 to 2028. The guidance clarifies that workers in specified service fields like healthcare and legal services are not eligible, and crucially, that mandatory or automatic gratuities do not qualify as deductible tips because they are not voluntary.</p>

The proposals, which must be approved by all 27 EU member states, also include a ban on the bloc's purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG). This move represents a significant escalation in the EU's efforts to curtail Moscow's energy revenues and puts pressure on third-country actors seen as enabling Russia's war economy.</p>
