          <p>UK vehicle production experienced a significant downturn in May, falling by 32.8% to just 49,810 units, marking the lowest output for the month since 1949, excluding pandemic-related shutdowns. The slump is attributed to ongoing model changeovers, industry restructuring, and the substantial impact of US trade tariffs, which saw shipments to the American market drop by 55.4%. Despite the challenging year, industry leaders express cautious optimism, citing new trade deals and a more positive relationship with the EU as potential drivers for future recovery.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, the most significant drop since October 2024, indicating that Beijing's stimulus measures are not yet boosting corporate profitability. The National Bureau of Statistics cited insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods as primary causes for the decline. Sectors like automotive manufacturing were hit hard, with profits dropping 11.9%. Despite this, some economists believe the worst may be over and that strong GDP growth could reduce the urgency for further stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis reflects on Keir Starmer's first year as UK Prime Minister, which began with a landslide election victory but quickly descended into crisis. The article details how an over-cautious campaign, the inexperience of the new cabinet, and internal tensions led to a lack of decisive direction. Early policy decisions, like means-testing winter fuel payments, proved unpopular and were later reversed, damaging the government's authority. The piece questions whether Starmer can overcome these early stumbles and prove to a volatile electorate that his government can deliver meaningful change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has been forced into a significant U-turn on its planned welfare reforms following intense pressure from his own Labour MPs. The proposed cuts were met with a large, organized rebellion that threatened to defeat the government in a parliamentary vote. This capitulation, less than a year into his term, is seen as a major blow to the authority of both Starmer and his Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. The article suggests this event could have lasting political consequences, undermining the government's image of firm leadership.</p>

          <p>The 1975 nuclear energy agreement between Germany and Brazil, once hailed as a major technology deal, marks its 50th anniversary amidst ongoing controversy and calls for its termination. The pact, which aimed to build nuclear plants in Brazil with German technology, has a troubled history, with only one of the eight planned reactors becoming fully operational. Critics, including Germany's Green Party, argue the agreement is outdated and unsafe, while supporters point to it as a milestone in technological partnership. The future of the treaty is uncertain as global interest in nuclear power resurges.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has sentenced Yoo Ju Hyun, a 23-year-old South Korean student, to a three-year prison term, suspended for four years, for injuring eight students in a hammer attack.

The presiding judge described the attacks as "dangerous and shocking" but noted that the defendant's actions were significantly influenced by a diagnosed mental disorder.

The increased funding and strategic focus are creating opportunities for commercial firms, as evidenced by Planet Labs securing a contract with NATO for monitoring capabilities.

Families of the missing, aged 16 to 39, have received ransom demands, with some victims reporting they were trafficked out of the country.

          <p>At a global forum in Bangkok, Unesco is urging international collaboration on ethical standards for artificial intelligence as the technology's influence rapidly grows. Unesco's Director-General Audrey Azoulay called for a unified solution from governments, businesses, and civil society to ensure AI serves the common good. The event highlighted the geopolitical divide in AI development, as major US and Chinese tech firms were notably absent. In response to questions about this division, Thailand's representative stated the country would not take sides but would instead focus on developing its own domestic AI ecosystem.</p>

          <p>A federal lawsuit has been filed by the ACLU of Idaho challenging a new state law that blocks undocumented immigrants from accessing certain public benefits, including a crucial program for HIV/AIDS medication. The complaint, filed on behalf of a doctor and four residents with HIV, argues the law is vague, contradicts federal statutes, and puts public health at risk. The law, effective July 1, could deny life-saving treatment to dozens of patients, potentially leading to devastating health outcomes and increasing the risk of HIV transmission within the community.</p>

The execution occurs amid growing debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, especially following the recent exoneration of a man who spent over 40 years on death row.

This frustration has created an opening for former U.S. Representative Conor Lamb, who lost to Fetterman in the 2022 primary, to reemerge as a prominent voice. Lamb has been appearing at town halls across the state, voicing the concerns of progressives who feel Fetterman has abandoned the platform he was elected on.

          <p>California authorities have eased lockdown restrictions at nine state prisons that were part of a statewide "modified program" implemented on June 12 due to a surge in violence and drug overdoses.

The measure was prompted by a rise in inmate homicides and unexpected deaths this year. While nine facilities have returned to normal operations, twelve other prisons across the state remain under heightened restrictions as investigations into contraband and violence continue.</p>
