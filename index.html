The Kyiv region reported three deaths, while Mykolaiv city and Khmelnytskyi region reported one and four deaths, respectively. This escalation follows one of the heaviest assaults on Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have intercepted numerous Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including Moscow, which briefly suspended airport flights, as the conflict continues with Russia controlling a significant portion of Ukrainian territory.

          <p>Several UK front pages highlight the government's plan to potentially scrap the two-child benefit cap, with The Observer reporting that the Treasury has been instructed to find the necessary funds. The Sunday Telegraph indicates Nigel Farage intends to challenge Prime Minister Starmer by also committing to scrap the benefit cap and reinstate winter fuel payments. The Sunday Mirror and Daily Mail lead with a new angle in the investigation into arson attacks linked to Prime Minister Starmer, focusing on potential Kremlin involvement and the possible recruitment of the charged individuals. The Sunday Times focuses on Alan Bates' criticism of the government's compensation approach to victims of the Horizon IT scandal, accusing them of running a "quasi kangaroo court."</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend, following its closure due to the Palisades Fire in January, which killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres. While the reopening is welcomed by many, including local surfers and businesses, some residents express concerns about increased traffic and insensitive tourists. The area is still visibly scarred by the fire, with debris and charred structures remaining. Despite the challenges, businesses are hopeful for a robust summer season, though some question whether visitors will respect the community's trauma.</p>

Some physicians argue that these restrictions lack scientific evidence and prioritize administrative ease over patients' rights to see loved ones.

          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their pets. The research found that dogs whose owners exhibit "work-related rumination" display more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to emotional contagion and changes in care routines when owners are preoccupied with work. The study suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts when at home, emphasizing the importance of separating work and personal life for the sake of their canine companions.</p>

          <p>The fifth anniversary of George Floyd's murder is commemorated in Minneapolis with a mix of celebration and reflection, underscoring the racial divides that persist in America. While events to mark the anniversary take on a tone of joy, family members express pride in the legacy of change sparked by Floyd's death. However, activists highlight the broader political picture, including the rollback of investigations into police forces, which they view as "white supremacy on steroids." The community acknowledges the perception of healing but emphasizes that true healing has never taken place, reminding us of the deep-seated issues that remain.</p>

The Martens were convicted of second-degree murder, but Lynch asserts they also tried to destroy Jason's character. Jason, a widower, hired Molly as an au pair, and they later married, moving to the United States. However, the relationship became troubled, and Jason planned to return to Ireland with his children. The Martens claim Jason was abusive, but Lynch disputes this, believing they killed him because he was leaving with the children, making this a complex case of family betrayal and disputed motives.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world's fastest electromagnetic coilgun. The new coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute, far surpassing traditional firearms and U.S. commercial models. This achievement centers on eliminating capacitors, the traditional bottleneck of electromagnetic weapons, by powering the gun directly with lithium batteries. This innovation, detailed in Chinaâ€™s Journal of Gun Launch & Control, could redefine future combat capabilities, marking a significant advancement in military technology.</p>

This decision aims to attract and retain talent amid growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine and increasing competition for skilled chefs. The improved conditions also include allowing chefs to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of serving as live-in chefs.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is considering a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States. According to internal documents, the agency argues that carbon dioxide emissions from power plants do not significantly contribute to climate change, a claim disputed by scientists. If enacted, this regulation would reverse Biden-era requirements for carbon capture and low-emission technologies. Critics argue that this move undermines the EPA's responsibility and endangers public health, given that power plants are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.</p>
