Apple's AirPods can now function as over-the-counter hearing aids and provide real-time language translation, lowering costs and stigma associated with traditional devices. Similarly, vision-assistance features in smartphones and the availability of over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors are making daily life more manageable for millions.

          <p>The Taliban government has formally rejected former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent suggestion that American forces could retake Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid stated that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity are paramount, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement. The statement emphasized that Afghanistan seeks constructive, economy-focused relations with all nations based on mutual interests. This public refusal counters Trump's hint that the Taliban might be open to a U.S. military return.</p>

          <p>In the women's 800m final at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Great Britain's Georgia Hunter Bell and Keely Hodgkinson won silver and bronze medals, respectively. Kenya's Lilian Odira secured the gold with a championship record time, narrowly preventing a British one-two finish. Hunter Bell, who had previously quit the sport for five years, edged out her training partner Hodgkinson by just one-hundredth of a second. The result marks a significant achievement for both athletes, particularly Hodgkinson, who was returning from an injury-plagued season.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government's recent multibillion-pound tech agreement with the U.S. is drawing criticism for its lack of public discussion on the potential downsides of artificial intelligence. The deal encourages the construction of vast, energy-hungry datacentres to support generative AI, which experts warn could significantly increase electricity and water consumption, conflicting with net-zero goals. Beyond the environmental impact, concerns are also rising about the social costs, including the erosion of students' cognitive skills and the potential for AI chatbots to negatively affect mental health.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump, which introduced a potential $100,000 fee for new H-1B skilled worker visas, caused widespread confusion and panic among current visa holders abroad. Many, like software professional Rohan Mehta who spent $8,000 on last-minute flights, scrambled to return to the U.S. before a perceived deadline, fearing they would be locked out. The White House later clarified that the one-time fee would only apply to new applicants and not current visa holders, but the initial announcement created significant distress and uncertainty for foreign workers and their families.</p>

          <p>Despite intense partisan battles over redistricting in states like Texas and California, the fight for control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections may not be decided by gerrymandering alone. While partisan map-making could shift several seats, historical trends and other key factors will likely play a more decisive role. Historically, the party not holding the presidency gains seats in midterms. President Trump's approval ratings, the state of the economy, and voter enthusiasm are expected to be more determinative of the outcome than the redrawing of congressional lines.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke is a more significant health threat than previously understood, causing an estimated 41,000 excess deaths annually in the U.S. from 2011 to 2020. As climate change intensifies, projections indicate this number could rise to nearly 71,000 deaths per year by 2050, with California expected to see the largest increase. The study highlights that smoke poses a nationwide risk, drifting far from fire-prone regions to affect populations across the country.

Research from institutions like MIT reportedly shows that users who rely on large-language models exhibit the weakest brain connectivity during writing tasks.

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a covert, Russian-funded network actively working to disrupt Moldova's upcoming parliamentary elections with disinformation. Through an undercover reporter, the BBC found the network pays participants to post pro-Russian propaganda and fake news targeting the country's pro-EU government. The operation, linked to fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, also involved conducting illegal polls to create a pretext for questioning the election's legitimacy. This effort represents a significant malign influence campaign in a strategically important country situated between Ukraine and the EU.</p>

          <p>More than a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in a septic tank in Nanyuki, Kenya, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with her murder. Wanjiru was last seen leaving a hotel bar with British soldiers in March 2012. Her friends, who have long sought justice, believe multiple soldiers were involved or helped cover up the crime. If an extradition occurs, it would be the first time a British soldier faces trial abroad for the murder of a civilian, marking a potentially pivotal moment in accountability.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team defeated Michigan State 45-31 in a high-scoring game, maintaining their undefeated record. Despite racking up 517 yards of total offense, USC struggled with defensive penalties that allowed the Spartans to remain competitive into the fourth quarter. Receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for 127 receiving yards and scoring a crucial late-game touchdown. The Trojans' rushing attack was also dominant, with Waymond Jordan running for 157 yards, but the team will need to address its discipline issues as it heads into a tougher stretch of the season against ranked opponents.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested after allegedly firing at least three shots into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. While no injuries were reported, the incident is being treated as a serious act of violence against journalists. The suspect was initially arrested by local police, released on bail, and then re-arrested by the FBI on a federal charge. The motive remains under investigation, but the shooting occurred during a week of heightened controversy surrounding ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," prompting condemnation from officials who called it an attack on democracy.</p>

Reporters must sign an agreement to abide by these rules or risk having their press credentials revoked, and their ability to move freely within the building is also being curtailed. Press freedom organizations have condemned the move as a form of prior restraint and government censorship that will severely limit the ability to hold the military accountable.

          <p>In an unusual intersection of economic trends, stalled and unfinished real estate projects across China are being repurposed as lavish film sets for the country's booming micro-drama industry. As the property sector struggles with cash flow shortages, the demand for opulent settings for popular urban romance dramas has created a new revenue stream for these otherwise idle properties. The on-screen luxury of these productions, filmed in empty sales halls and model apartments, presents a stark contrast to the reality faced by homebuyers waiting for their unfinished flats, highlighting both a cultural phenomenon and a severe economic downturn.</p>

          <p>As thousands gather for the memorial of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, federal authorities have reportedly found no evidence linking his accused killer, Tyler Robinson, to any left-wing organizations. This finding contrasts with efforts by the Trump administration to blame the assassination on political opponents. Prosecutors believe Robinson, who allegedly texted that he "had enough of his hatred," acted alone. The killing has intensified a national debate on political violence and has also led to a backlash against those who criticized Kirk, resulting in numerous firings and suspensions in what some call an attack on free speech.</p>

          <p>A new Chinese film titled "731" has become a box office success, earning over 1.1 billion yuan while renewing public focus on Japanese war crimes committed during World War II. The movie depicts the infamous Unit 731, a covert Japanese biological and chemical warfare research facility where horrific human experiments were conducted on Chinese prisoners. Released to coincide with the anniversary of the 1931 Mukden Incident, the film's popularity comes at a time of deteriorating public perception between China and Japan, with some concerned it could further strain already frayed diplomatic relations.</p>
