          <p>The White House and Qatar are in talks regarding the transfer of a luxury Boeing 747-8Z5 jet for potential use as Air Force One, sparking legal and ethical debates. Qatar's Media Attach√© confirmed ongoing negotiations between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, emphasizing that no final decision has been made, but that the matter remains under review. While Qatar denies that the plane would be a gift, it acknowledges that the transfer of an aircraft for temporary use is under discussion between the two countries. Trump defended the negotiations, referring to the plane as a gift offered for his use at no cost.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several of its premade food offerings from businesses across California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington due to a listeria outbreak first identified last year.

While no illnesses have been linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety. The outbreak was originally identified in 2024, sickening at least eight people in California and two in Nevada.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower U.S. drug costs, a revival of a program he previously failed to implement. The proposal, likely to face opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, would impact drugs covered by Medicare and administered in a doctor's office. Trump argues this will save the government trillions of dollars, though the actual figure is unclear.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is in talks with the Qatari government about accepting a luxury Boeing 747 airplane that could temporarily serve as Air Force One. The offer, which comes on the eve of Trump's visit to the Middle East, raises legal and ethical questions. Trump pushed back against those concerns in a post on his Truth social Sunday night. Democrats questioned whether the deal was even legal, with one senator suggesting it was a cash payment to Trump in exchange for favors.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, causing widespread delays on Sunday. The Federal Aviation Administration said the outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says a fix for the airport's problems is on the way, but in the coming weeks the number of flights will be cut. Passengers expressed frustration with the ongoing issues and delays.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison across the Southern border due to concerns over the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision, citing the need to protect the nation's food supply. The U.S. and Mexico were able to eradicate the New World screwworm in the 1960s and '70s by releasing hundreds of millions of sterile adult flies. The new ban will continue on a "month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved," according to the USDA.</p>

Sales of these products are rising, with 8.3% of food product launches making protein claims in the first three months of 2025. While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, some experts believe whole foods are better than processed snacks. Many supermarket products advertising their protein content are "gimmicky" and might not be as good for you as advertised. Excess protein is stored in the body as fat, so it is important to be mindful of calories.</p>
