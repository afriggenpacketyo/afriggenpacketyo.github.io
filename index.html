          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday after failing to reach an agreement on pay raises, effectively shutting down train service and inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. The union, representing about 460 engineers, claims they haven't received a pay raise in five years and that the competition pays more. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home if possible, and Governor Phil Murphy says all options are on the table, including a state of emergency. The agency has a contingency plan with additional bus service, but it can only handle about 20% of daily train riders, while other options include Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, or ferry service.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination in a since-deleted Instagram post featuring the numbers "8647." Trump claims Comey knew the numbers meant "assassination," echoing similar accusations from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Comey has denied that his post was a threat, explaining that he didn't realize the numbers were associated with violence and removed the post after learning of the association.

Lutts, who faces manslaughter charges, had been living openly in Toronto without legal status for 21 years. An anonymous tip led authorities to suspect Lutts was in Canada, where he was placed under surveillance before his arrest in February under the Canadian Extradition Act. The 1998 crash resulted in the deaths of two teenagers, and investigators allege Lutts had a high blood alcohol level at the time.</p>

          <p>Hadi Matar, the man convicted of attempting to stab Salman Rushdie to death, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for the attack, which left Rushdie critically injured. Matar spoke briefly during his sentencing, stating that he believed Rushdie to be a hypocrite. The attack took place at a summer resort in 2022. Rushdie had been living under threat for decades due to a religious edict calling for his death after his novel 'The Satanic Verses' was published.</p>
