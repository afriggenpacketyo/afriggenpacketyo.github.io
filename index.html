          <p>Police officers are expressing strong support for President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate taxes on overtime pay, citing potential benefits for officer retention and morale. Officers claim that the proposed tax cut would provide much-needed financial relief and serve as a form of appreciation for their dedication. They believe that removing taxes on overtime could encourage senior officers to remain in their roles longer, mentoring younger officers and improving overall department stability.

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. Investing in CDs allows you to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, and they are generally safe investments with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Current national averages for CD yields are 2.00% APY for 1-year CDs, 1.69% APY for 3-year CDs, and 1.71% APY for 5-year CDs, but top CDs today offer much higher rates. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

To secure the best rate, choose a high-yield savings account, look at online banks, and compare different accounts to find the product that maximizes your savings.

          <p>Atlanta Fed Chair Raphael Bostic indicated that he is currently inclined to support only one interest rate cut this year, citing concerns about potential upward pressures on inflation due to tariffs. Bostic noted that the tariffs have been larger than initially anticipated, leading him to believe it will take longer for the situation to resolve. While the Federal Reserve aims to balance maximum employment and stable prices, Bostic expressed greater concern about rising inflation expectations, which could complicate the Fed's efforts. The tariff picture has evolved since President Trump took office, with recent pauses and truces, but Bostic emphasized that even the reduced tariffs remain economically significant.</p>

He emphasizes that the dollar's status as the reserve currency provides significant economic benefits to Americans, and questions why the administration would enact policies that undermine this advantage.

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin to push for an end to the conflict in Ukraine following peace talks in Istanbul. Trump stated that the call will focus on stopping the 'bloodbath' and discussing trade. This renewed contact with Putin comes after hopes for progress in Istanbul were scuppered, as Putin declined to attend despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's invitation. Contacts between U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian officials have continued, with discussions emphasizing the need for a ceasefire and sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Bills Predicted to Fall in July</h2>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household will fall by Â£129 annually, a decrease of nearly 7%. While this offers some relief, energy prices remain significantly higher than previous years, raising concerns about affordability for many households. Experts emphasize the need for government policy action to further reduce energy bills and improve home energy efficiency.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. Despite the aggressive nature of the cancer, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, while messages of support have poured in from across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>Investors are advised to remain vigilant for potential market surprises following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating due to large fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. The downgrade has already led to a sell-off in stocks and a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield. Another potential market surprise is the upcoming third-quarter earnings season, where the cumulative impact of tariffs may be most severe. Experts suggest that earnings may soften in the third quarter, as the effects of tariffs begin to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, faced criticism after stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to receiving ample amounts from supporters, amid soaring rice prices affecting households. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urged Eto to retract the "problematic" remarks but allowed him to remain in his role to ease the burden of rising rice prices. The government has been criticized for its delayed response in releasing stockpiled rice to curb prices. Rising rice prices have exacerbated the financial strain on consumers, who are also dealing with increased costs for other food items and energy.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic explores the historical shifts in the understanding and expression of male friendship, contrasting the passionate, celebrated bonds of men in the Renaissance era with modern depictions of male friendships as emotionally stunted. It delves into the concept of emotional communities, highlighting how societal expectations shape the ways individuals experience and express emotions. The article examines how women's friendships gained prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries, while male friendships became subject to new narratives and anxieties. The author suggests that reexamining our emotional rules could foster more meaningful connections in an age of social fragmentation.</p>

The results indicate a continued struggle between established political forces and emerging nationalist movements.
