          <p>Severe flash flooding in central Texas has resulted in at least 24 fatalities, with dozens more, including up to 25 children at a summer camp, reported missing. The Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in under an hour, causing what officials describe as a shocking and terrible catastrophe on Independence Day. Despite a massive search and rescue operation involving hundreds of personnel, helicopters, and drones, local officials admitted they lacked an advance warning system for a flood of this magnitude.</p>

          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the scene of a massive explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California. The July 1 incident, which also sparked an 80-acre grass fire, left seven people unaccounted for, and positive identification of the remains is pending. Investigations revealed the warehouse, located on property owned by a county sheriff's lieutenant, was operating without the necessary local licenses for storing commercial fireworks, adding a layer of regulatory failure to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided loss in Dodger Stadium history, an 18-1 rout by the Houston Astros. Longtime Dodgers villains Jose Altuve and Christian Walker led the offensive onslaught, with Altuve hitting two home runs and Walker adding another. The game was marked by a disastrous sixth inning where the Dodgers' pitching staff gave up ten runs, highlighting significant struggles as the team faced a surging Astros squad.</p>

Social media users and journalists quickly pointed out that China is, in fact, the world's largest producer of wind energy, with more than triple the capacity of the United States. The comment came as Trump renewed his attacks on renewables and as his administration's policies are set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move some analysts call strategically self-harming.</p>

          <p>Despite claims from the Social Security Administration, President Trump's newly signed tax bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65, which applies to their total income, not just their benefits. Policy experts clarify that while this provides some relief, it is misleading to frame it as a repeal of the tax on benefits, and it primarily benefits higher-income seniors rather than the lowest earners who already pay no tax.

This process stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood, highlighting their critical but often overlooked role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the severe dangers of ketamine addiction through the personal stories of young users and the opening of the UK's first NHS clinic for children struggling with the drug. Experts warn that young people are increasingly using ketamine to self-medicate for mental health issues, drawn to its dissociative effects, low price, and availability. Chronic use can cause horrific physical damage, including permanent bladder and kidney failure, a condition doctors are seeing in patients as young as 12.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has officially banned the protest group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization after a judge rejected a last-minute appeal to block the proscription. The ban, which makes supporting or being a member of the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison, follows a series of direct actions causing millions in damages. The group's lawyers argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group that does not advocate for violence, but the courts upheld the government's decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that President Trump's new tax law provides the largest benefits to the wealthiest 1% of households, particularly in states with no income tax. In 2026, the top 1% in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to receive average tax cuts of over $100,000. This is because they benefit from lower federal rates and business tax breaks without being negatively impacted by the bill's cap on state and local tax deductions, which primarily affects high-tax states.

          <p>A federal judge has denied a final, eleventh-hour request to halt the deportation of eight migrants with criminal records from a U.S. facility in Djibouti to South Sudan. The decision came after the Supreme Court clarified that a lower court's previous order protecting the men was no longer enforceable, clearing the way for the Trump administration to proceed. Attorneys for the men had argued they could face torture or harm in South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties, but the judge ruled he was bound by the Supreme Court's orders.</p>

          <p>This article reveals the story of Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American professor who has become a key, unofficial negotiator between the U.S. and Hamas in Gaza ceasefire talks. After being contacted by Hamas in April due to his connections with the Trump administration, Dr. Bahbah has been working from Qatar to relay messages and build trust. His involvement, which he claims was instrumental in securing the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May, represents an unusual "outside the box" diplomatic channel in the high-stakes negotiations.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong support for a decade-old proposal from Warren Buffett to tackle the U.S. national deficit. The idea, which Buffett framed as a simple "5-minute fix," is to pass a law making all sitting members of Congress ineligible for reelection if the federal deficit exceeds 3% of GDP. Musk reposted a clip of Buffett's proposal with the words "100%" and "This is the way," adding his influential voice to a concept that taps into public frustration over a lack of fiscal accountability in Washington.

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with an egg from another couple to improve the chick's chances of survival, and the two males have successfully taken on all parenting duties. The event highlights that same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins and contributes to the conservation breeding program for the vulnerable Humboldt species.</p>
