          <p>The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder will compete in the NBA Finals, marking the end of a long championship drought for one of the teams. The Thunder, previously the Seattle SuperSonics, last won a title in 1979, while the Pacers have only reached the Finals once before in 2000. Oklahoma City had a dominant regular season with a 68-14 record, fueled by young stars like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, while the Pacers upset the New York Knicks in a tightly contested Eastern Conference Finals.

          <p>Actor George Wendt, known for his role as Norm Peterson on "Cheers," inadvertently linked himself to Ohio politics when he confused John Boehner with another politician during a late-night television appearance. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, who was running against Boehner, mistakenly accused Boehner of being involved in a scandal. Boehner's team responded, leading to a heated exchange, but Boehner ultimately won the election. Despite the initial tension, Boehner later said that Wendt apologized, and they had a friendly conversation, with Boehner remembering Wendt fondly after his death.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying bee hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident prompted authorities to close the road and advise the public to avoid the area to prevent stings. Beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible, with the goal of helping them re-hive and find their queen. By the next morning, most of the bees were expected to return to their hives, and the road was reopened after about 24 hours.</p>

Many productions have moved to other states and countries offering more generous tax incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed more than doubling the state's film and TV tax credits to retain productions, but some industry insiders worry it may be too late to reverse the trend.</p>

While spending increased sharply in 2024, it is projected to slow down, requiring careful prioritization.
