        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing a mutual model where postmasters would own the service. This move comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters and severely damaged public trust. The government aims to reform the organization's culture and stabilize its finances before implementing major structural changes. The consultation also seeks input on future services, particularly banking, as traditional bank branches close across the country.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), highlighting them as a tool for savers to combat inflation. It contrasts the lower national average yields with the significantly higher rates offered by online banks, which have fewer overhead costs. The piece also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. It suggests strategies like laddering CDs to maximize earnings while maintaining flexibility in a changing rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the current landscape of mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates, acknowledging the challenges homebuyers face with higher rates. It provides average rates for 15-year and 30-year loans, noting that actual rates vary based on individual credit profiles and location. The report suggests that borrowers may see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. It also offers practical advice for securing a better rate, such as improving one's credit score and comparing offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

During an NBA Summer League broadcast, Hield explained that he was "a little disappointed" by his visit to the Colosseum in Rome.

          <p>A 20-year-old man who escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, has been recaptured by authorities. The inmate executed an unusual escape by hiding inside a large bag carried by his cellmate, who was being officially released from the facility. The escape, which was discovered 24 hours later, prompted an internal investigation into what a prison official described as a series of serious dysfunctions and material errors. The official also highlighted that the prison is severely overcrowded, operating at 170% capacity, which complicates working conditions for staff.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about declining cognitive skills in children post-pandemic, some experts are advocating for 'brain training' programs in schools.

Critics worry that replacing core curriculum time with unproven cognitive training could be detrimental, especially for disadvantaged students.</p>

          <p>A serious near-miss incident occurred over Siberia involving two Chinese airplanes that came within 300-400 feet of each other, far closer than the 1,000-foot minimum safety standard. The event happened when an Air China flight from Shanghai to Milan made an unexplained and unrequested climb in altitude. Air traffic control recordings suggest the pilot may have misheard an instruction intended for another aircraft in the vicinity. The incident, which took place over a remote part of Russia, is now under investigation to determine the precise cause of the dangerous maneuver.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, boxing trainer Dave Coldwell expresses his strong reservations about Manny Pacquiao's return to the ring for a world title fight at age 46. Coldwell argues that allowing the boxing legend to bypass a gradual comeback and jump directly into a championship bout undermines the sport's meritocracy. He notes that Pacquiao's skills appeared faded in a recent exhibition match and worries about the health risks of competing at an elite level so far past his prime. The trainer fears the fight could end badly for Pacquiao and tarnish his legacy for younger fans.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4th floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been suspended due to a renewed threat of flash flooding. Emergency crews were evacuated from the Guadalupe River corridor as new thunderstorms brought heavy rain to the already saturated region. The original disaster killed over 100 people and left more than 160 missing after the river rose with unprecedented speed. This new weather system is compounding the tragedy, creating dangerous conditions for responders and prolonging the search for those still unaccounted for.</p>

Goodridge pushes back against critics who call the idea unrealistic, noting that the board has voted for freezes four times in the last decade based on data.
