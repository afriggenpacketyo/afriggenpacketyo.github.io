          <h2>Post Office Entangled in Horizon System Due to Costly Contract</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 00:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Post Office has spent over Â£600 million to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite attempts to replace it for over a decade. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu gave the Post Office limited rights to the system's code, making switching suppliers prohibitively expensive. This reliance on Fujitsu led to the wrongful prosecution of approximately 700 sub-postmasters based on faulty data. The Post Office finally obtained rights to the Horizon software in 2023, but experts believe the contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond 2026 while a replacement is built.</p>

          <p>Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China, suggests that the U.S. may reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to revive trade talks. He believes that Beijing will need to reciprocate for a deal to be reached. The White House is reportedly considering cutting tariffs on non-strategic Chinese goods by more than half. While most countries saw a pause in Trump's reciprocal tariffs, the duties imposed on China remained in place.</p>
