          <p>Political commentator Don Lemon commented on the controversial Olympic boxing match between Algeria's Imane Khelif and Italy's Angela Carini. Lemon suggested that Carini, having entered the ring knowing her opponent, bore some responsibility for the outcome of the fight, which ended quickly due to Khelif's powerful punches. The match has fueled a widespread debate over gender eligibility in sports, with Khelif having previously failed eligibility tests from other boxing associations. The controversy involves various international sports bodies and political figures.</p>

          <p>Reports circulating on Chinese social media falsely claimed that Poland had officially sent troops to Ukraine, escalating the conflict. A fact-check by DW traced these claims to a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding military cooperation on drone defense. The Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training activities would occur exclusively on Polish territory. The spread of this disinformation is linked to Chinese content farms aiming to create informational chaos and push pro-Russian narratives.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but remain over open water. The current forecast track shows Gabrielle moving north of the Caribbean and away from major landmasses, though it could pass east of Bermuda next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a significant mutual defense pact, declaring that an attack on one nation will be considered an attack on both. The agreement strengthens security ties between the two countries, with Pakistan's defense minister indicating its nuclear capabilities could be available to Saudi Arabia if needed. This development comes amid shifting alliances in the Middle East and has been interpreted by some as a hedge against Iran and a signal of decreasing reliance on the U.S. as a security partner. India has stated it is studying the implications of the pact for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a "demographic mission" to address what his government calls a "conspiracy" of irregular migration, particularly from Bangladesh. The ruling BJP party claims that Muslim "infiltration" is causing a demographic shift and threatening national security and local livelihoods. Critics argue the mission is a pretext to target minority populations, particularly Muslims, and is a form of demographic engineering aimed at consolidating the BJP's Hindu nationalist voter base. This follows other controversial citizenship initiatives, such as the Citizenship Amendment Act.</p>

Despite core inflation running above the Fed's 2% target, Kashkari points to a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations as justification for further easing.

Critics, including former immigration judges and lawyers, allege a broader effort to eliminate judicial independence, fire judges who grant asylum at high rates, and remove due process protections.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. In this system, a third-party middleman company purchases goods from the retailer at a wholesale price and then handles the sale and shipment to the U.S. consumer. This allows the tariff to be paid on the lower wholesale value rather than the final retail price, significantly cutting costs. While this strategy helps retailers avoid passing costs to customers, some logistics experts question its long-term scalability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dozens of individuals across the U.S. have faced professional repercussions, including firings and suspensions, for their public comments on his death. The crackdown has affected people in various fields, from government workers and journalists to academics and airline pilots, often following pressure campaigns from conservative activists. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's show was suspended, and employees at federal agencies and major airlines have been disciplined. Civil liberties advocates have raised concerns that this wave of disciplinary action could chill free speech.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are attempting to roll back several health and environmental protections related to PFAS "forever chemical" pollution from U.S. military bases. The proposed changes, included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), would delay a ban on PFAS-containing firefighting foam and cut cleanup funding by $200 million. This comes after years of Congress adding new PFAS regulations and amid evidence of widespread water contamination and health risks for service members and nearby communities. Environmental groups have criticized the move as an attempt to repeal crucial protections behind closed doors.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's electoral coalition, which saw gains among Latino, Black, and young voters in 2024, may be showing signs of "buyers' remorse." The author points to rising youth unemployment, persistent inflation, and looming healthcare cuts as factors contributing to the president's underwater approval ratings among these key demographics. While Trump's support appears to be weakening, the article questions whether the Democratic party is organized and coherent enough to capitalize on this moment. The piece suggests economic issues are proving more salient than the social issues often prioritized by Democrats.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers have published a study outlining a framework for a naval defense system designed to counter potential attacks from large drone swarms. The paper warns that coordinated attacks by thousands of drones could overwhelm the defenses of traditional warships. The proposed countermeasures, described as a naval "Great Wall," include a layered defense system using high-power microwaves, ship-mounted lasers, and long-range hypersonic missiles. The publication coincided with a military parade that showcased new anti-drone weapon systems, suggesting the ideas are being actively developed.</p>

After other options were exhausted, Stephen was found to be a compatible partial match and agreed to the procedure, becoming one of the youngest known donors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The donation required special procedures due to the boy's age, but he was reportedly brave throughout the process.
