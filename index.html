          <p>The Chinese animated film 'Nobody' has become the highest-grossing 2D animated feature in the country's box office history, earning over 1 billion yuan. Developed by Shanghai Animation Film Studio, the movie has surpassed popular Japanese films like 'Suzume' and 'The Boy and the Heron,' signaling a potential shift in market dominance. The film is based on the 2023 online series 'Chinese Bizarreries' and is distinguished by its unique ink-wash painting aesthetic, which aims to create a distinctly Chinese visual style. This success marks a significant cultural and commercial achievement for China's domestic animation industry.</p>

Zelensky noted it was their "best of meetings," and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated his expectations were exceeded. The talks focused on securing an end to the war in Ukraine and ensuring the return of Ukrainian children captured by Russian forces. Despite the positive tone, doubts linger regarding the specifics and reliability of the commitments made toward Ukraine's security and long-term support.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein is reportedly exploring a move of its corporate headquarters from Singapore back to China. This strategic consideration is aimed at persuading Beijing to approve its planned initial public offering in Hong Kong. The company has faced significant regulatory hurdles and delays in its attempts to list publicly in both London and the United States, partly due to allegations of forced labor in its supply chain and policy headwinds in Western markets. A return to China could streamline the approval process with Chinese regulators, though the discussions are still in a preliminary phase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Air Canada's 10,000 flight attendants have ended their four-day strike after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline. The strike, which began on a Saturday, caused significant disruptions during the peak summer travel season, affecting approximately 130,000 travelers daily and leading to numerous flight cancellations. The breakthrough came after late-night negotiations assisted by a mediator. The dispute centered on wages and compensation for unpaid work performed on the ground, with the union initially defying a back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board before the deal was struck.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, ending their quorum break and allowing the legislature to resume business. The Democrats had left the state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional district maps, a move that could give the GOP up to five additional U.S. House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. With their return, the fight shifts from obstruction to legal and procedural challenges against the proposed maps. The situation has national implications, as California Democrats are now pursuing their own redistricting plan to counteract the potential Republican gains in Texas.</p>

Collier, who communicated via Zoom, framed her resistance as a challenge to what she views as unjust government decisions and the controversial new congressional maps.

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced the activation of 4.5 million militia members across the country in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. This move follows the Trump administration's decision to double the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and the launch of U.S. anti-drug operations in the Caribbean. Maduro condemned the U.S. actions and called for the formation of additional peasant and worker militias to defend national sovereignty. The deployment signals a significant escalation in tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics since 2014. Despite the miss, the home improvement retailer maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating total sales growth of 2.8%. The company noted that homeowners continue to show a "deferral mindset" regarding large projects, but it saw encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. The retailer's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could spur more home improvement spending. (not investment advice)</p>

For instance, Manchester United's valuation has risen from £790 million in 2005 to around £5 billion in 2024.

          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to the restoration of natural wetlands to combat the dual threats of intense flooding and severe droughts driven by climate change. The region's high degree of urban sprawl and sealed surfaces exacerbate flood risks from heavy rainfall. By "depoldering" land—giving rivers more space—and restoring marshlands, authorities are creating natural buffers that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during dry periods. This nature-based solution, part of the comprehensive 'Sigma Plan,' demonstrates a strategic shift from traditional hard infrastructure to more sustainable climate adaptation methods.</p>

          <p>According to royal author Ingrid Seward, Prince William's deep-seated mistrust of Meghan Markle remains a primary reason for the ongoing rift with his brother, Prince Harry. Seward asserts that William is acutely aware of the negative perception of the Duchess of Sussex among many monarchists in the U.K., who view her as damaging to the royal family. This sentiment, combined with the couple's public criticisms of the monarchy since stepping back from their roles, has created a profound and lasting divide. Experts suggest that any reconciliation is unlikely until Harry makes a move to apologize for the perceived betrayals.</p>

Experts also point to increased stress and societal negativity as contributing factors to incivility. What constitutes rudeness varies by personal experience, generation, and culture, but its contagious nature can negatively impact mood and cooperation.</p>

The piece warns that such tactics will not make campuses safer for anyone and may even fuel antisemitic tropes. It calls for a united defense of the university against what it describes as a destructive, illiberal agenda disguised as a fight against hate.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Federal Response to Campus Antisemitism Highlights Disparity in Addressing Anti-Black Racism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Trump administration's aggressive actions to combat antisemitism on college campuses are presented as necessary, they expose a stark inconsistency in how the government addresses hate. The author contends that Black students and employees have for generations faced pervasive anti-Black harassment, threats, and racism at predominantly white institutions with little to no equivalent federal intervention or financial penalties. The piece questions why the government is threatening to revoke funding and demand massive settlements for antisemitism while largely ignoring similarly severe and widespread anti-Black racism, suggesting a double standard in accountability for educational institutions.</p>

          <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against the Santa Monica Proper hotel, an upscale establishment where rooms can cost over $2,600 a night, alleging it failed to pay employees the city-mandated minimum wage. The complaint, filed on behalf of approximately 100 workers, claims the hotel has been paying staff less than the required rate for hotel workers, which was $20.32 per hour as of July 2024. The lawsuit highlights the disparity between the hotel's luxury pricing and its compensation for staff, noting some employees earn less per hour than the cost of a bowl of hummus at the hotel's restaurant.</p>

          <p>In the northern Swedish city of Kiruna, a landmark 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The massive 672-tonne structure is being relocated to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining in the area. The entire city center is being moved, but the church's journey is the most symbolic part of the project. Hoisted on giant trailers, the church is traveling at a maximum speed of 500 meters per hour, a complex engineering feat that has drawn large crowds to witness the historic event.</p>

The 30-year-old performer stated that he is now in a good place after seeking therapy, which he says has helped him to "actually love yourself more."

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to undo the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding, which provides the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases, is causing concern within the corporate world. While many companies have opposed stringent climate regulations, they also rely on federal standards to create a predictable investment environment and as a defense against climate-related lawsuits. Repealing the finding would eliminate all federal greenhouse gas standards, a move that legal experts and business groups warn could lead to regulatory disruption and a surge in litigation from states and environmental advocates, creating chaos for long-term planning.

          <p>An examination of gun violence since the COVID-19 pandemic reveals its devastating and disproportionate impact on Black communities, particularly in rural areas like Bogalusa, Louisiana. Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children, with young Black men being the most affected demographic. This public health crisis persists as the Trump administration actively works to roll back gun violence prevention measures, weaken federal oversight of the gun industry, and cut funding for intervention programs. Critics argue these policies undermine efforts to save lives in neighborhoods already struggling with systemic disinvestment and racial discrimination.</p>

However, despite the positive framing and a stated "sense of unity" among the leaders, anxiety persists in European circles about Ukraine's long-term security.

          <p>Certain toxic toads in South America produce a cardiotonic steroid that can induce a fatal heart attack in predators, serving as a potent defense mechanism. However, this same class of toxins has a long history of use in human medicine, dating back to ancient Egypt. Evolutionary biologist Shabnam Mohammadi studies how some predators have evolved resistance to these toxins. Interestingly, specific versions of these cardiotonic steroids are still prescribed by doctors today to treat patients suffering from congestive heart failure, showcasing the paradoxical relationship between poison and medicine in the natural world.</p>

          <p>Amid a political dispute between the Trump administration and Washington, D.C.'s local government, both sides are using crime statistics to support their conflicting narratives about public safety. While the White House points to a near-doubling of the homicide rate since 2012, the mayor highlights that violent crime is at a 30-year low and has declined significantly since a 2023 spike. Experts explain that interpreting crime data accurately depends heavily on the chosen time frame, as different periods can tell different stories. They caution that while data is insightful, public perception of safety is often driven more by the nature of specific crimes than by overall statistical trends.</p>

The AI4All program aims to democratize AI education by teaching students the complex math behind the technology and empowering them to develop AI solutions for real-world problems.
