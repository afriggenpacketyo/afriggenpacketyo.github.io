        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports. The agreement, which President Trump described as possibly the largest ever, includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. This development caused Japanese auto stocks to soar, as the new tariff rate is lower than the previously threatened 25%, providing relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry.

          <p>Columbia University has taken disciplinary action against dozens of students involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, which included occupying a library and setting up campus encampments. The punishments range from probation and multi-year suspensions to degree revocations and expulsions, following individual case assessments. This move comes as the university attempts to restore $400 million in federal funding that was cut by the Trump administration over allegations of failing to address antisemitism on campus. The university stated that disruptions to academic activities violate its policies.</p>

          <p>The latest Henley Passport Index has once again named Singapore's passport the most powerful in the world, granting its citizens visa-free access to 193 countries. Japan and South Korea tied for second place, while several European nations filled out the top rankings. The report highlights a continued downward trend for the United States and the United Kingdom, which have slipped to 10th and 6th place, respectively. The index primarily measures travel freedom based on the number of destinations accessible without a prior visa, using data from the International Air Transport Association.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented joint statement, the UK's top counter-terrorism and crime agencies, including MI5 and the NCA, have warned parents about the risk of children being radicalized online during the summer holidays. The agencies report an increasing trend of young people being exposed to extreme content, including violence, terrorism, and sexual abuse, leading to desensitization. Authorities are urging parents to discuss online safety with their children and utilize parental controls. This warning follows a concerning rise in terrorism-related investigations involving minors in recent years.</p>

          <p>Federal judges in New Jersey have removed interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal lawyer to President Trump, from her position by declining to make her appointment permanent. Citing a rarely used power, the judges appointed her top assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the role instead. However, in a swift response, the Trump administration's Justice Department ousted Grace just hours later, accusing the judges of political activism. The move has been condemned by New Jersey's Democratic senators as an attempt to undermine judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, who served as a border official under President Trump, strongly rebuked Hunter Biden for his recent comments on the administration's immigration policies.

Homan dismissed the criticism, contrasting the current border security measures with those of the previous administration. The exchange also drew a response from Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who commented on Biden's past struggles with drug addiction, a topic Biden himself has discussed publicly.</p>

While some victims' families expressed relief at avoiding a painful trial, others felt conflicted by the decision. The case, which drew intense national media attention, was solved using cell phone data and DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back 250 years. Originally a Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. It ultimately wrecked in a storm off Orkney in 1788, with all crew members surviving. The identification was made possible through scientific analysis and dedicated research by the local island community, which has rallied to preserve the historic timbers.</p>

The article points to the recent reassignments of several high-ranking female officers, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations. The author suggests these moves reflect Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's documented views that women are a distracting influence in the military.
