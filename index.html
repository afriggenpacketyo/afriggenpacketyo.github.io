          <p>Lululemon's stock experienced a significant 20% drop in after-hours trading following the company's announcement of a weaker-than-expected full-year financial outlook. The athletic apparel retailer attributed the downward revision to the impact of U.S. tariffs, which are projected to reduce profits by approximately $240 million. While second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, revenue fell slightly short, and the company reported a decrease in same-store sales in the Americas. CEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged that product offerings have become "stale" and outlined plans to introduce more new styles to regain momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

The anticipated report has raised concerns in the market, reflecting Kennedy's history of questioning established medical treatments and vaccines. In response, Kenvue stated that it has continuously evaluated the science and maintains there is no causal link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism, a position supported by the FDA and other medical organizations.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, specifically through the Sepulveda Pass, is scheduled for a partial closure this weekend to begin a major repaving project. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) announced that the freeway will be reduced to three lanes in each direction over a 10.2-mile stretch between Van Nuys and Westwood. This $143.7 million project aims to improve driver safety by repaving lanes, replacing signs, and upgrading guardrails. Motorists are being strongly advised to find alternative routes or use public transportation to avoid major traffic disruptions during the closure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has raised the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year, a significant change from the $10,000 limit established by his 2017 tax legislation. The SALT deduction, which allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct state and local income and property taxes, was historically unlimited before the 2017 cap. This increase is expected to primarily benefit taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, critics note the policy change is projected to add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several U.S. states, including a West Coast coalition of California, Washington, and Oregon, are forming their own bodies to issue vaccine recommendations, breaking from the CDC's guidance. This move comes in response to actions by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Public health experts express grave concern that this fragmentation of vaccine policy, driven by a loss of faith in the federal government's scientific integrity, could dismantle decades of public health infrastructure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the “Department of War,” arguing the original name has a stronger sound associated with winning past conflicts like World War I and II. The current name was established in 1947 under President Harry Truman, who unified the Army and Navy departments to improve coordination and deter future conflicts in the nuclear age. While the name change would require congressional approval for it to be official, the move signals a rhetorical shift toward a more bellicose posture, which some historians fear could imply a greater willingness to engage in armed conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added a mere 22,000 jobs in August, falling drastically short of the 80,000 forecast by economists and signaling a sharp cooling of the labor market. The unemployment rate also ticked up to 4.3%, while data for June was revised to show a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This slowdown is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's tariffs, which has made employers hesitant to hire. The weak report increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting interest rates, holders of maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing a less favorable savings climate. Simply allowing a CD to roll over could lock in a much lower rate, prompting financial experts to suggest exploring alternative strategies. Among the options are high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive rates with greater flexibility, and money market accounts that combine high interest with checking-like features. Another strategy is to reinvest in a new long-term CD to secure a fixed rate for multiple years, providing protection against further market declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is canceling its flight services in 12 U.S. cities, including a complete withdrawal from all Northern California airports. Effective October 2, the airline will no longer operate flights to Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, or San Diego. The route cuts are a direct result of the company's financial struggles, having filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time this year as it seeks to eliminate unprofitable routes. Spirit cited poor demand for domestic leisure travel and adverse market conditions after losing nearly $257 million in a recent quarter, casting doubt on its ability to remain operational.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is sending ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico, escalating its military operations against what it describes as a Venezuelan-led drug trafficking network in the Caribbean. This deployment follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat carrying alleged drug traffickers and a separate incident where Venezuelan military planes buzzed a U.S. warship. The move signals a sustained and aggressive military campaign in the region, which critics, including some members of Congress, have condemned as a "lawless and reckless" use of force that could lead to unintended conflict without proper legal justification.</p>

          <p>A new image captured by the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the growing tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The photograph reveals that the comet's coma, a cloud of dust and gas, and its tail have become significantly more extended, indicating increased activity as it approaches the sun. Scientists are studying the light emitted from the comet to learn more about its chemical composition and how it changes during its journey. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock surged after the company announced it secured a fourth major customer for its custom artificial intelligence chips, with orders totaling over $10 billion. While Broadcom did not name the client, analysts widely believe it to be OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. This development significantly boosts Broadcom's AI revenue forecast and strengthens its position in the competitive AI hardware market alongside existing clients thought to be Google, Meta, and ByteDance. The news underscores the immense and growing demand for specialized processors capable of handling large-scale AI workloads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A congressional investigation by House Republicans has found that the Pentagon funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes, some of which are blacklisted by the U.S. for their links to China's military. The report from the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party argues that these partnerships have allowed China to exploit American taxpayer-funded research for its own military and technological advancement. This raises serious national security concerns, as it could erode U.S. technological dominance while strengthening a primary strategic competitor. The Pentagon has not yet responded to the findings.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has imposed a €2.95 billion fine on Google for violating EU competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that the tech giant abused its dominant market position by favoring its own online ad display products and its advertising exchange, AdX, to the detriment of rival services. The Commission stated that this "self-preferencing" led to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers, potentially impacting consumers. Google has called the decision "wrong" and announced its intention to appeal, arguing its services are not anti-competitive and that alternatives are widely available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant cabinet reshuffle following the resignation of his deputy, Angela Rayner. David Lammy has been appointed as the new deputy prime minister and justice minister, moving from his previous role as foreign minister. Yvette Cooper will take over as the new foreign minister, while Shabana Mahmood will become the home secretary, responsible for issues like illegal migration. The shake-up aims to stabilize the government after Rayner's departure over a tax error, which has added pressure to Starmer's administration amid declining popularity and a rising challenge from the Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as the UK's deputy prime minister and housing secretary after an ethics inquiry found she had breached the ministerial code by underpaying tax on a property purchase. The inquiry concluded that while she acted with integrity, she failed to seek adequate specialist tax advice regarding the purchase of her flat. In her resignation letter, Rayner took full responsibility for the error, which reportedly involved an underpayment of £40,000 in stamp duty. Her departure is a significant blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government and has triggered a major reshuffle of his cabinet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Democrats are strategically overusing President Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling many of the administration's controversial actions as mere distractions from the Epstein files. While Trump's past friendship with the late financier is a political vulnerability, the author contends that framing authoritarian moves like National Guard deployments or threats against political opponents as simple diversions is a flawed strategy. This approach, the article suggests, not only minimizes the seriousness of Trump's actions but also reveals a lack of more effective messaging from his opponents, potentially distracting from other significant vulnerabilities of the administration.</p>
