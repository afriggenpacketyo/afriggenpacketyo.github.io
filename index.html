          <p>Banking heir Timothy Mellon has been identified as the anonymous donor who provided $130 million to President Trump, intended to cover military salaries during the ongoing government shutdown. The donation, which amounts to roughly $100 per service member, may potentially violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress. Mellon is a prominent long-term donor to Trump, having previously contributed $50 million to a supportive super PAC, marking one of the largest single political donations publicly recorded.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing electronics, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move comes after China implemented new export license requirements and curbs, leveraging its dominant market position and causing disruptions for some European companies. The EU's strategy includes exploring alternative sources, forming partnerships with other producing nations like Australia and Canada, and significantly boosting recycling efforts.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. He allegedly sent text messages detailing a plan to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City, stating he could not allow the "terrorist to live." This incident is part of a rising number of threats against legislators and has drawn criticism regarding the blanket pardons issued to Capitol riot defendants, some of whom have since been arrested for other crimes.</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery, with salmon returning to headwaters for the first time in over a century. A group of 28 Indigenous teenagers marked the milestone by becoming the first to kayak the river's entire 310-mile length, an event that drew international river advocates. This successful restoration project is now serving as a global model, inspiring other Indigenous-led movements to protect and rejuvenate waterways around the world.</p>

          <p>The campaign for California's Proposition 50, which would allow for the redrawing of congressional districts to favor Democrats, is heavily framing the measure as a direct response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in other states and former President Trump. Proponents, including Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Barack Obama, argue it is necessary to "fight fire with fire" and counteract a Republican advantage in the House. Polling suggests this strategy is effective, with a majority of supporters indicating their vote is a way to oppose Trump's influence on national politics.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or optimizing rest through technology, has fueled a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like smart mattresses and neurotech headbands. However, a recent outage of Amazon Web Services highlighted a key vulnerability, as users of the high-tech Eight Sleep mattress found their beds stuck in uncomfortable positions or temperatures. While some sleep technology can be beneficial for those with specific medical conditions, the increasing reliance on complex systems introduces new points of failure into what should be a natural biological process.</p>

Described as an "underwater phantom," the small, lightweight drone is made from a transparent hydrogel material, allowing it to operate almost silently with low power consumption. Its lifelike design makes it ideal for observing fragile ecosystems, inspecting underwater structures, and potentially for covert military applications without disturbing the surrounding environment.</p>

Since late 2023, Berkshire has reduced its Apple stake by 69%, a move that has so far resulted in leaving an estimated $50 billion in potential profits on the table as Apple's stock continues to reach new highs.

The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The work captures a poignant moment at the end of Picasso's and Maar's tumultuous relationship, with experts noting its remarkably preserved, vivid colors, which had previously only been seen in a black-and-white photograph.</p>

Health authorities warn that flu can "spread like wildfire" in schools and cause serious illness, emphasizing that vaccination is the most effective protection. While many children have received the nasal spray vaccine at school, pop-up clinics and GP surgeries are available for those who still need it during the half-term break.</p>
