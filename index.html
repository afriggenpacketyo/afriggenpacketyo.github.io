          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by appealing to budget-conscious consumers amid industry-wide economic pressures. CEO Russell Weiner stated that the company sees current industry headwinds as an opportunity, citing 3.4% same-store sales growth driven by value deals and new products like stuffed crust pizza. Unlike competitors offering deals on less popular items, Domino's is focusing on promotions for desirable products, which has successfully grown sales across all income levels. The company believes this value-focused strategy will continue to attract customers who are increasingly choosing to eat at home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a heated town hall in Philadelphia, DNC Vice Chair Malcolm Kenyatta compared former President Donald Trump to notorious segregationists like George Wallace. Kenyatta warned of impending strife, claiming the country is facing a moment similar to the Civil Rights era, with metaphorical "dogs and firehoses" at the ready. He accused Trump of historical revisionism and promoting a message of "segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever." The event also featured former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who urged Democrats to aggressively pursue political power, including through mid-decade redistricting, to counter Republican tactics.</p>

          <p>Author Joseph Lee's debut book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the rich indigenous heritage of Martha's Vineyard, an island his people, the Aquinnah Wampanoag, call Noepe. The book moves beyond the island's popular image as a luxury vacation spot to explore the complex reality of indigenous life, where tourism provides economic sustenance but also threatens displacement. Lee, a member of the tribe, discusses the challenges of preserving cultural identity amid tourist stereotypes and high property taxes. He reflects on the meaning of belonging to a sacred land that is simultaneously a playground for the affluent.</p>

          <p>A new law has established an independent regulator to oversee the top five divisions of men's football in England, a move hailed by fans as a historic moment for the game. The Football Governance Act, a key recommendation from a fan-led review, will grant the regulator powers to improve financial sustainability, prevent clubs from joining breakaway leagues like the European Super League, and give fans a greater say in club decisions such as changes to team colors or stadium locations. The English Football League chairman praised the bill for ensuring clubs can compete without the constant threat of financial disaster.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, is scheduled for sentencing after being convicted on federal charges related to the 2020 death of Breonna Taylor. A jury found Hankison guilty of violating Taylor's civil rights by using excessive force when he fired multiple shots into her apartment through a covered door and window during a botched raid. Although the Justice Department recommended a sentence of only one day in prison, civil rights advocates have condemned this as an insult to Taylor's memory. Taylor's death became a focal point in the national movement against police brutality and racial injustice.</p>

This opinion piece argues their unequivocal statements provide much-needed clarity in the campus debate over the Israel-Palestine conflict. The author contends that while not all anti-Zionists are antisemitic, the act of anti-Zionism, which singles out the Jewish state for elimination, is inherently a form of antisemitism. Recognizing this can help shift campus discussions from fruitless debates over Israel's existence to more productive critiques of its policies.</p>

It involves a complex series of verifications, code decryptions, and simultaneous actions by multiple officers in separate locations. These extensive redundancies are designed to ensure that no single individual or crew can initiate a launch on their own, or prevent a legitimate one, safeguarding against rogue actions within the nuclear command structure.</p>

          <h2>An Explainer on Federal Student Loan Borrowing Limits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the maximum amounts students can borrow through federal student loans, which vary based on dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate lifetime limit is $31,000. These limits are often insufficient to cover the full cost of college, which averages over $38,000 annually. When federal loans are not enough, students may turn to private loans, which can offer lower rates but typically require a credit check and may lack federal borrower protections.

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become a major public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Backed by prominent crypto investors, the company plans to differentiate itself from bitcoin-proxy firms like MicroStrategy by focusing on generating yield through staking. The company's chairman argues that this makes ether a more "productive" asset, as current ether ETFs do not offer staking capabilities, thereby missing out on potential dividends for investors. The move comes as institutional interest in tokenization and ether grows. (not investment advice)</p>

A total of 21 people were hospitalized, and five, including two children, remain in the hospital. An off-duty firefighter who was traveling behind the coach was able to begin freeing passengers immediately after the accident. Police have launched an investigation into the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>The Texas Legislature is meeting for a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, an effort pushed by former President Trump to bolster the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting is unusual, as the state's GOP-controlled legislature had already adopted a new map after the 2020 Census. The Justice Department has alleged that some current districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, providing a pretext for the redrawing. However, critics argue the move is a purely political effort to secure more Republican seats, which could face significant legal challenges and potentially backfire politically.</p>

          <p>Three major manufacturers—Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup—are recalling approximately 5 million above-ground pools due to a serious drowning hazard. The recall follows the deaths of nine children, aged 22 months to 3 years, between 2007 and 2022. The Consumer Product Safety Commission found that the pools, which are 48 inches or taller, have compression straps that can create a foothold, allowing children to climb in even when the ladder is removed. The companies are offering a free repair kit that involves securing the pool with a rope and removing the hazardous straps.</p>

          <p>In a widely circulated interview, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva commented on the legal situation of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup plot. Lula told the American people that if Donald Trump were Brazilian and had committed acts similar to the U.S. Capitol attack, he would also be on trial and potentially arrested in Brazil for violating the constitution. The statement comes as Trump defends Bolsonaro, calling his trial a "witch hunt." Lula's direct message highlights the contrasting legal consequences faced by the two populist leaders for challenging election results.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing issue of smartphone addiction, which is linked to mental health problems like depression and anxiety. Scientific research suggests that breaking the addiction requires a multi-faceted approach, as willpower alone is often insufficient. Recommended methods include creating physical distance from the device, such as leaving it outside the bedroom at night, reducing notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to make it less rewarding. For severe cases where smartphone use significantly impacts life and relationships, professional help like cognitive behavioral therapy is advised to address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

He argues that Kennedy's actions, such as reformulating a key vaccine advisory panel with anti-vaccine advocates, have led to needless suffering and death.
