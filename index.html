          <p>Meta's AI strategy, particularly its Llama models, is taking center stage as the company prepares for its first Llama-branded conference and quarterly earnings report. Investors are keenly watching for signs of return on investment from Meta's substantial AI spending, especially with President Trump's tariffs potentially increasing costs. Analysts anticipate Meta maintaining its $60-$65 billion capex guidance for AI infrastructure, viewing it as a crucial long-term investment. The success of Llama in powering AI agents for customer interaction within Facebook and WhatsApp is considered vital for Meta's future in the multi-trillion dollar AI market.

          <h2>Canadian Elections Shaped by Trump's Policies and Leadership</h2>

          <p>Canada's recent elections were significantly influenced by President Trump's policies and rhetoric, particularly his threats to annex Canada and impose tariffs. This led to a shift in focus from domestic issues like cost of living to concerns about defending Canada's sovereignty. The Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, capitalized on this shift, portraying themselves as the best option to resist Trump's attacks. The election results highlight the complex relationship between Canada and the United States and the impact of U.S. politics on Canadian affairs.</p>

          <p>The termination of the NIH's MOSAIC grant program, designed to support scientists from underrepresented backgrounds, has created uncertainty and fear among recipients. These early-career scientists worry that the loss of funding, coupled with President Trump's opposition to diversity programs, could negatively impact their future career prospects. They fear being "blacklisted" by the NIH for having received an award associated with diversity initiatives. The program funded research on various diseases and aimed to enhance diversity in biomedical research.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to ramp up deportations, but data suggests the pace is currently slower than the last fiscal year of the Biden administration. Critics argue that the administration's rush to increase deportation numbers has led to mistakes, including the deportation of a 2-year-old American citizen. In a separate development, Canada's election has been influenced by Trump's actions, with the Liberal Party gaining ground due to concerns about Trump's policies and rhetoric towards Canada.</p>

          <p>Investment in European real estate is showing signs of recovery, with investment volumes increasing by 6% in the first quarter of 2025.

However, CBRE warns that recent souring of global economic sentiment, influenced by the new U.S. tariff regime, could potentially impact investment appetite moving forward.</p>
