          <p>Kenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol, experienced a significant drop in its share price following reports that US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will suggest a possible link between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism. The company has vehemently defended the safety of its over-the-counter pain reliever, asserting that leading medical organizations agree there is no causal link between acetaminophen and autism. This development occurs amidst years of lawsuits alleging such a connection, despite a US judge recently dismissing federal cases due to a lack of scientific evidence. The forthcoming federal report from Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, aims to address the rise in autism rates, though scientific studies on acetaminophen's link remain inconclusive, with some research indicating a potential association and others finding none.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive day, Venezuelan military aircraft, identified as F-16 fighter jets, flew in the vicinity of the USS Jason Dunham in international waters near South America, according to Pentagon officials. This action, described as a 'game of chicken,' follows a similar incident and is seen as a 'highly provocative move' designed to interfere with US counter-narcoterrorism operations. The USS Jason Dunham, an Aegis guided-missile destroyer, did not engage, despite the aircraft being within weapons range. President Trump warned of potential consequences if such dangerous flyovers continue, as the US flotilla targets criminal organizations and narco-terrorism in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's yuan has recently experienced a rally, which analysts primarily attribute to strong guidance from its central bank rather than organic market forces, given the relatively steady US dollar index. This period of strengthening is anticipated to remain measured, as Beijing aims to avoid negatively impacting the competitiveness of its exporters amidst existing trade tensions with the United States. Even with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to a September interest rate cut, the US dollar index has shown no significant weakening. This indicates a strategic move by China's central bank to bolster the renminbi, even when broader currency markets are not necessarily trending in that direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, currently running for New York City mayor as an independent, held a breakfast meeting with influential civil rights activist Rev. Al Sharpton. Cuomo is reportedly seeking Sharpton's endorsement, as he significantly trails Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in recent polls. Sharpton, who previously urged Cuomo to withdraw from the race, acknowledged Mamdani's impressive standing but also his long-standing relationship with Cuomo. This meeting occurs while current Mayor Eric Adams, also running as an independent, denies rumors of dropping out for a potential Trump administration role, adding further complexity to the competitive mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sky has suspended its two-time All-Star, Angel Reese, for the first half of Sunday's game against Las Vegas, citing comments she made that were deemed 'detrimental to the team.' This suspension follows Reese's prior one-game absence due to a mandatory WNBA suspension for her eighth technical foul of the season. The team released a statement affirming its dedication to player safety, respect, and well-being, indicating the issue has been handled and resolved internally. Reese had previously voiced frustrations with the team's outlook, even suggesting a potential departure, though she later walked back those comments and offered an apology to the team.</p>

          <p>The Garnet fire in California's Sierra National Forest has approached within three miles of the McKinley Grove, a significant stand of approximately 200 giant sequoias, raising major concerns for the US Forest Service. Nearly 1,800 firefighters are battling the blaze, implementing measures like sprinkler lines and strategic burns to protect the vulnerable trees. Although recent dips in temperature and increased humidity offer some hope, conditions remain variable. This incident highlights the ongoing threat to giant sequoias, with an estimated 20% having perished in wildfires over the last decade, making groves like McKinley, which hasn't burned recently, particularly susceptible.</p>

          <p>The August jobs report has raised alarms among economists, revealing a significant slowdown in US hiring with only 22,000 nonfarm jobs added, far below forecasts, and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3%. Experts highlight three key takeaways: the job market is stalling, job growth is at its lowest in 15 years (excluding 2020), and a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September is now highly likely, possibly a larger 0.5 percentage point reduction. This weak data, coupled with rising inflation, fuels concerns about potential 'stagflation' and puts pressure on the Fed to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

With Hisahito second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, the lack of other young male heirs beyond his father raises urgent questions about reversing a 19th-century ruling that abolished female succession.

          <p>A LendingTree analysis reveals that lottery spending is increasing across the US, with Massachusetts residents spending the most, averaging $915 annually on tickets. Rhode Island follows with $573, while North Dakotans spend the least at $50, possibly due to limited access in rural areas. Lottery sales contribute significantly to state revenues, accounting for about 1% of general revenue nationally, and up to 3% in states like Rhode Island. With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, this trend highlights both the public's pursuit of life-changing wins and the substantial financial impact on state budgets.

          <p>The Senate is advancing its version of a major market structure crypto bill, introducing a new provision that would classify tokenized stocks and other securities as securities, not commodities. This legislative effort, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025, aims to clarify regulatory oversight for digital assets, laying groundwork for when they fall under SEC or CFTC jurisdiction. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope for bipartisan support and presidential approval by year-end, following the recent signing of a stablecoin bill by President Trump. The bill's passage is crucial for crypto companies seeking clearer regulatory frameworks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant offers crucial advice for potential winners on choosing between a lump sum or annuity payments. While a lump sum of roughly $826.4 million offers immediate control, it's deemed 'dangerous' for many due to overspending risks, with many past winners going broke. The annuity option, paid over 29 years, is considered a 'safe bet' to prevent rapid depletion of funds. The expert also advises winners to keep their win secret, secure the ticket, and immediately seek counsel from an attorney, accountant, and financial adviser before making any decisions.

          <p>Russia has intensified its digital control by imposing new restrictions on WhatsApp and Telegram calls, while aggressively promoting its new state-controlled 'super-app' called Max. This initiative, backed by Kremlin-linked firms, aims to consolidate multiple digital services, mirroring China's WeChat, and is seen by many as a tool for censorship and surveillance. Concurrently, Russia is experiencing increasing mobile internet blackouts across numerous regions, officially attributed to protection against Ukrainian drone attacks, though experts doubt its effectiveness. These measures, including bans on VPN ads and 'extremist' online searches, signify a dangerous escalation in government control over citizens' digital lives.</p>
