          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump voiced strong disapproval of Vladimir Putin's escalated attacks on Ukraine, labeling them "absolutely crazy" and expressing dismay over the loss of life. Trump, who has often spoken favorably of Putin, indicated he is considering imposing additional sanctions on Russia in response to the increased aggression, particularly the recent barrage of missiles and drones targeting Ukrainian cities. He also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that Zelenskyy's statements were not helping the situation. Trump further distanced himself from the conflict, calling it "Zelenskyy's, Putin's, and Biden's War, not 'Trump's.'"
