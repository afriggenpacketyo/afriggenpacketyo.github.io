          <p>Following the release of a preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash, relatives of the victims are expressing their grief and demanding full accountability. The report found that the Boeing 787's engine fuel switches were moved to the "cut-off" position moments after takeoff, leading to the crash that killed 260 people. Ria Patel, whose grandmother was on the flight, stated that she cannot find peace until the root cause is determined and responsibility is assigned. Other families echoed this sentiment, calling for the release of cockpit audio to provide clarity and closure.</p>

          <p>Germany has advanced to the knockout stage of the Women's Euro 2025, but a 4-1 group stage loss to Sweden has exposed significant defensive vulnerabilities. Despite an early lead, the German team experienced a rapid collapse, including a red card and a penalty, which highlighted issues with personnel and tactical execution. Coach Christian Wück acknowledged the team's poor performance and the need to address these problems before their quarterfinal match. The defeat marks the first time Germany has conceded four goals in a Euros match, raising questions about their championship contention.</p>

          <p>A new book titled "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" provides a deeply sourced analysis of the recent U.S. election. Authored by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, the book examines the factors that led to Donald Trump's victory, including institutional failures and voter frustration. It explores several "what-if" scenarios, such as Joe Biden not running for re-election or different outcomes in Trump's legal battles. The review highlights the book's chronicle of Trump's actions upon returning to office and the broader implications for American democracy.</p>

This comes as President Trump announced a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico, escalating trade tensions.

          <p>President Trump stated he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his long-time rival, Rosie O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland. The statement, made on social media, follows O'Donnell's recent criticism of the administration. Legal experts note that the President has no authority to revoke the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen, citing a 1967 Supreme Court ruling that affirms this protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. This represents the latest instance of the president threatening to use his power against political opponents.</p>

          <p>An aviation analyst has suggested that a chip malfunction, rather than pilot error, could be responsible for the Air India crash that killed 260 people. Following a preliminary report indicating the plane's fuel cutoff switches were activated, former pilot Marco Chan pointed to a service bulletin from engine manufacturer General Electric about a flawed chip. This chip, if not properly maintained, could cause a signal loss that effectively cuts fuel to the engines. Chan noted that the switch design makes accidental activation by a pilot extremely unlikely, shifting focus towards a potential mechanical or electronic failure.</p>

          <p>A historic Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) made a safe precautionary landing after experiencing an engine problem during an event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the iconic World War Two aircraft diagnosed unusual behavior in one of its four engines and issued a general emergency alert before returning to its base at RAF Coningsby. No one was injured in the incident, and the Royal Air Force has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the issue. The aircraft, PA474, is one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to address concerns about extreme heat. This decision follows criticism regarding player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. The covered venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver will be prioritized for games played during the hottest parts of the day. Infantino acknowledged heat as a significant issue but expressed confidence that this logistical adjustment will help ensure player safety during the tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.</p>

          <p>A rumored vacation visit to Disneyland by Vice President JD Vance sparked a protest outside the Anaheim resort on Friday. The demonstration formed after speculation that the Vice President was in the area for personal reasons, following the landing of Air Force 2 at a local airport. Protestors and local officials cited recent ICE raids and administration policies affecting immigrant communities as the reason for their opposition to his presence. While the visit was not officially confirmed, online videos later appeared to show Vance and his children inside the park, with a noticeable security presence.</p>

          <p>A TikTok video of Nykia Hamilton, a single mother of three, running a Burger King restaurant in Columbia, South Carolina, by herself for over 12 hours has gone viral. Hamilton stated that being left to manage all operations alone is a frequent occurrence due to severe understaffing, causing her to miss time with her children. The story highlights broader labor shortage issues in the fast-food industry, driven by low wages and difficult working conditions. In response, Burger King issued a statement affirming its policy requires more than one employee per shift and is investigating the situation with the franchisee.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed threats of significant tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has remained relatively stable, with major indices near record highs. This contrasts with the market panic seen during earlier tariff announcements, suggesting investors have become more accustomed to the administration's negotiation tactics. Analysts believe the market is focusing more on the positive implications of other administration policies, such as deregulation and a permissive stance on artificial intelligence development. These factors are seen as driving corporate earnings growth, which is currently outweighing the potential negative impact of the trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third Test between England and India is finely balanced at Lord's after England bowled the tourists out for 387, matching their own first-innings score exactly.

          <p>Two fathers in England are launching a legal challenge against the government in an effort to get smartphones completely banned from schools. Will Orr-Ewing and Pete Montgomery have formally notified the Education Secretary of their intent to seek a judicial review, arguing that current guidance is unlawful and fails to protect children. They contend that smartphones expose students to harmful content, cyberbullying, and exploitation, citing numerous safeguarding incidents. The fathers believe a full ban is the only safe approach, while the Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to implement their own bans.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash has deepened the mystery surrounding the disaster, which killed 260 people. The cockpit voice recorder captured a pilot asking why the fuel "cut-off" was activated, with the other pilot denying he had done it, just seconds after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel, causing the Boeing 787 to lose power. Investigators are now focused on this crucial exchange to understand if the catastrophic failure was due to intentional action, pilot confusion, or a potential mechanical or electronic fault with the switch system itself.</p>
