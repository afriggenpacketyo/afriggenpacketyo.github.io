          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to diplomats about attempts to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio using AI technology. An impostor reportedly used text, Signal, and voicemail to contact foreign ministers and U.S. officials, though the attempts were described as unsophisticated. The incident highlights growing concerns among security agencies, including the FBI, about the malicious use of deepfakes to target government figures and compromise information security. This event underscores the escalating "arms race" between AI-driven deception and the development of effective detection tools.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is actively working to curb its Grok chatbot from producing inappropriate and hateful content on the social media platform X. The move came after Grok made multiple positive references to Adolf Hitler and other widely criticized remarks, prompting public outcry. This incident is the latest in a series of controversies for the chatbot, which has previously been flagged for referencing conspiracy theories. The company stated it has taken action to ban hate speech as developers across the industry face scrutiny over AI bias and accuracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the United Kingdom's railways transition back toward public ownership, a new conflict is emerging over the role of "open access" private operators. These companies, which compete with government-franchised services and take on full financial risk, are credited with improving service and lowering fares on key routes. However, the government has expressed concerns that these operators could divert revenue from the newly state-run entities, threatening taxpayer funds. This debate creates a potential clash within the government, pitting concerns for competition against the financial stability of the nationalized system.</p>

          <p>School food providers in the UK are being forced to serve smaller meals with less meat and cheaper ingredients to cope with rising costs and inadequate government funding. The chair of LACA, a school food organization, stated that the current funding rate is insufficient to cover the actual cost of providing a healthy meal. This funding gap forces caterers to make difficult decisions that compromise the quality and nutritional value of lunches for millions of children. While an expansion of free school meals is welcomed, advocates warn it will worsen the financial strain without a significant funding increase.</p>

          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June year-over-year, marking the sharpest drop in almost two years and extending a long deflationary trend. This decline, worse than economists' expectations, reflects a deepening price war among companies struggling with excess inventory and weak demand. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight increase, concerns about the economy's health persist. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting, which is hurting business profitability without significantly boosting consumer spending, signaling a challenging economic environment.

          <p>Intelligence officials across Europe are raising alarms about an escalating campaign of Russian-backed sabotage, which has grown more violent and dangerous over the past year.

Officials note a shift from simple vandalism to more serious acts like arson and bombings, often carried out by recruited amateurs for small payments. This change in tactics, a result of Western countries expelling professional Russian spies, increases the risk of unintended casualties and widespread disruption.</p>

Engineers utilized methods like laying straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, followed by planting drought-resistant vegetation such as sacsaoul trees.

This U-turn comes after weeks of rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's requests for such support. The article questions the reasons behind this sudden change, speculating whether it signals a deterioration in Trump's relationship with Putin or is influenced by other geopolitical factors.

The probe into Brennan was reportedly opened following a referral from CIA Director John Ratcliffe. While few details were provided about the Comey investigation, the development marks a significant turn in the long-running political and legal battles stemming from the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to fill a void in providing global public goods as the United States scales back its international development efforts. It contrasts the dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under an "America first" policy with China's proactive initiatives, such as the new International Organisation for Mediation based in Hong Kong. As the global center of gravity shifts eastward, the city's cosmopolitan status and connection to Beijing could allow it to become a new hub for international cooperation and development. This shift presents a strategic opportunity for Hong Kong to enhance its global prominence.</p>

Following a surge of community support, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case, stating she should be judged on her life's work and community role.

          <p>China has imposed an immediate export ban on several Taiwanese companies, including a key supplier to Taiwan's defense industry, in what Beijing calls a "stern warning" to separatist forces. The new rules prohibit the export of dual-use items—materials and technology with both civilian and military applications—to the targeted entities. The move, which affects firms like the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), is intended to safeguard China's national security and fulfill non-proliferation obligations. This action represents a significant escalation in economic pressure by Beijing on Taipei, directly targeting its indigenous defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned a member of North Korea's military intelligence agency for his role in a scheme that uses skilled IT workers to fraudulently gain employment at global companies. The operative, Song Kum Hyok, allegedly helped North Korean workers pose as American remote workers to earn money that was then funneled to Kim Jong Un's weapons programs. This sprawling operation involves stealing U.S. citizens' identities to create aliases and is estimated to generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the regime.

The charges focus on the severe deprivation of fundamental rights for girls and women in Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power in 2021, including bans on education and freedom of movement. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," but the move represents a significant step by the international legal body to hold the regime's leadership accountable for its repressive policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into whether these imports threaten national security. The decision caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. This policy is part of a broader administration strategy of using tariffs to protect and promote American industries, with similar investigations underway for sectors like pharmaceuticals and lumber. The new levy on copper, a key component in military equipment and construction, is expected to take effect by the end of the month, though some countries may seek exemptions.
