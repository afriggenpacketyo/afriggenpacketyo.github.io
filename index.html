          <p>The FBI has found bones during a two-day search operation in a heavily vegetated area of Washington state for Travis Decker. Decker is a fugitive wanted for the murder and kidnapping of his three young daughters, whose bodies were discovered in his truck in early June. The recovered bones are currently being analyzed to determine if they are human or animal remains. The extensive search, involving nearly 100 personnel, also uncovered other potential evidence as authorities continue their manhunt for the sole suspect in the girls' deaths.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has blocked the Trump administration's initiative to broaden the scope of fast-track deportations for immigrants. The ruling specifically prevents the application of expedited removal to immigrants who entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole status. The judge's opinion cited significant due process concerns, stating that while the policy is constitutional at the border, applying it to a large group of people living within the country without proper procedures is unlawful. This decision represents a setback for a key component of President Trump's immigration enforcement strategy.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have successfully set a new world record by rowing unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia broke the previous record of 162 days. The brothers overcame significant challenges, including violent tropical storms that forced detours and even swept one of them overboard, though he was safely recovered. The record-breaking feat also served as a fundraiser, raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

He was sentenced to over eight years in prison, the longest sentence for a congressman at the time. After his release, he maintained a low profile and received a pardon from Donald Trump in 2021.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway in Southern California has reopened to the public just before Labor Day weekend after a prolonged closure. The scenic route was shut down due to significant damage from slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement caused by severe winter storms in 2022 and 2023, as well as the Bridge fire in 2024. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to restore access to popular hiking trails and alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads in the Angeles National Forest.</p>

          <p>Police in Epping, England, arrested three men on suspicion of offenses including violent disorder and assaulting an officer during protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers. The demonstration followed a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction, allowing 138 asylum seekers to remain at the hotel. Tensions in the town have been high since July, particularly after an asylum seeker was charged with the sexual assault of a teenager, leading to 28 protest-related arrests to date. The local council is considering a further appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Data obtained by the BBC reveals that live-fire military training exercises have caused 385 wildfires on Ministry of Defence (MoD) land in the UK since January 2023. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, which makes it too dangerous for crews to access the areas. A recent large moorland blaze in North Yorkshire was hampered by exploding bombs from past training. While the MoD states it has policies to mitigate risks, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during dry months.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has confirmed it revoked the visas of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials, preventing them from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited their efforts to seek unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and undermine peace efforts as the reason for the ban. The move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision as a violation of international law, while Israel welcomed it.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, experts are weighing in on what their highly anticipated wedding might look like. Planners suggest the event will be intensely private, likely held at a location with personal significance rather than a typical venue, and require strict non-disclosure agreements from all involved. Given Swift's history of fan engagement, she may sprinkle "Easter eggs" for her followers while keeping the core details secret. Fashion experts predict her gown will be romantic and statement-making, possibly from an international designer, reflecting her red-carpet style.</p>

          <p>Major coffee chains such as Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, shift towards new trends like matcha. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is said to be exploring a sale of the chain for significantly less than its 2019 purchase price. Analysts suggest that the rise of smaller, trend-focused cafes like Blank Street Coffee, which appeal to "Gen Z" with colorful, social-media-friendly drinks, is challenging the dominance of traditional brands. The combination of changing preferences, cost-of-living pressures, and the popularity of home coffee machines has created a difficult market for established players.</p>

          <p>Concerns about the "grooming" behavior of gymnastics coach Sean Gardner were reported to USA Gymnastics as early as 2018, four years before he was banned from the sport and later arrested on federal sexual abuse charges. His former boss claims she reported him, and parents at his subsequent job at an elite Iowa academy, owned by famed coach Liang Qiao, also raised alarms about inappropriate touching. Despite these warnings, Gardner was promoted. The U.S. Center for SafeSport has since sanctioned Qiao and other coaches for failing to report the misconduct allegations against Gardner.</p>

A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, where the science and technology minister presented plaques to revamped labs, highlighted the city's role in this national strategy.

The move makes Missouri the latest state to engage in an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle, following similar partisan efforts in Texas and California.

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," is set in a grungy 1998 New York City, creating a nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of his early work. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld over a case of mistaken identity. However, the review argues that despite its stylish execution and a cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the film prioritizes style over substance. The characters are described as cartoonish, and Butler's performance is deemed too charming to convincingly portray a man in genuine peril, resulting in a disposable thriller.</p>
