          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has regained Category 4 strength as it moves over the Atlantic Ocean. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, the National Hurricane Center warns it will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the seaboard this week. Tropical storm warnings are currently in effect for the Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas, with officials urging vigilance as the powerful storm's intensity continues to fluctuate.</p>

This move has been hailed as a significant victory for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which advocates for economic pressure on Israel. While the immediate financial impact on Israel may be limited, analysts suggest it could set a precedent for other international funds and embolden further BDS campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre is facing a critical by-election in a rural Alberta riding to regain a seat in the House of Commons after losing his previous constituency. The election is seen as a major test of his leadership, especially as he faces a mandatory review in January and competes against a record number of candidates. The outcome and his margin of victory will be closely watched as an indicator of his political strength against the new Liberal government under Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>

The summit, which will include numerous European leaders, follows Trump's recent meeting with Vladimir Putin, after which Trump appeared to pressure Kyiv to accept territorial concessions for peace. Trump has explicitly ruled out Ukraine joining NATO and regaining Crimea, shifting the diplomatic landscape and increasing pressure on Zelenskyy to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a frontrunner for New York City mayor, represents a betrayal of young people and the working class. The author criticizes his proposals, such as a rent freeze and a $30 minimum wage, as failed policies that would shrink the housing supply, increase unemployment, and stifle economic growth. The piece draws parallels to the economic troubles in cities like Chicago and countries like Venezuela, asserting that such socialist agendas ultimately harm the populations they claim to help.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration claims its broad tariff policies will spark a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, but many economists express skepticism. Experts argue that the president's erratic approach, the questionable legality of the tariffs, and the increased costs for domestic producers will likely reduce competitiveness and employment. Unlike the Biden administration's targeted industrial policies for sectors like semiconductors, Trump's across-the-board tariffs are seen as creating uncertainty that discourages the long-term investment needed to build new factories.

          <p>Swiss watchmaker Swatch has issued an apology and withdrawn a global advertisement after it caused a significant backlash among Chinese consumers. The ad featured a model making a "slanted-eye" gesture, which is widely considered a racist trope mocking people of Asian descent.

          <p>Ahead of a crucial White House meeting, President Trump has stated that Ukraine should not expect to regain Crimea or join NATO as part of a peace deal.

          <h2>Trump Rules Out NATO Membership for Ukraine Ahead of White House Talks with Zelenskyy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 23:26:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has asserted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can end the war "if he wants to," while explicitly ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine as part of any peace settlement. These comments, made just before a critical White House meeting, also dismissed the possibility of Ukraine regaining the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. The statements align with long-standing Russian demands and intensify the pressure on Zelenskyy, who is meeting Trump alongside European allies to negotiate Ukraine's future security.</p>
