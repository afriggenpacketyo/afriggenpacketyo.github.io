          <p>Elon Musk attempted to disrupt a major artificial intelligence infrastructure deal in the Middle East after learning that his startup, xAI, was excluded from the initiative involving OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco, and Emirati firm G42. Musk reportedly argued that President Donald Trump would disapprove of the deal and intervened to involve xAI, delaying the announcement. The White House acknowledged the AI partnership between the U.S. and the UAE but did not comment on Musk's involvement. Musk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, suing the company for breach of contract and unsuccessfully bidding to buy control of the startup. The context of this article involves the ongoing competition between Musk and Altman in the AI sector, impacting Trump's efforts to solidify U.S. leadership in AI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's global tariff policy has encountered a significant obstacle as a federal court ruled that he lacks the authority to unilaterally impose certain levies. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in the ruling, arguing that it will create a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and weaken the president's leverage in trade negotiations. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration will work to "aggressively revoke visas" for Chinese students at U.S. universities as the dispute with Harvard continues to escalate.

The aircraft is expected to be used by Trump as the new Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office, after which ownership will transfer to the Trump presidential library foundation.

          <p>A new Israeli-backed aid initiative opened a third hub in Gaza to distribute food to a desperate population, but chaotic scenes unfolded, with crowds scrambling for handouts and stun grenades being fired. The United Nations and other aid groups have declined to cooperate with the new mechanism, citing concerns that it violates humanitarian principles. The UN reports that while some aid trucks are getting through, distribution is hampered by a lack of secure routes, and negligible quantities of food are reaching those in need. Against this backdrop, Israel and Hamas are considering a new cease-fire proposal from President Trumpâ€™s Middle East envoy.</p>

          <p>Non-alcoholic beer is projected to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide by volume this year, according to industry tracker IWSR. While overall beer volume decreased by roughly 1% in 2024, the volume of non-alcoholic beer grew by 9% worldwide. This growth is attributed to more consumers reducing their alcohol consumption, particularly among younger generations who use terms like "sober curious" and "damp lifestyle." Major beer brands have invested in zero-proof alternatives that mimic the taste of alcoholic versions, contributing to the trend.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from barring Harvard from enrolling international students. The decision comes after a legal battle over the administration's attempt to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll students and scholars on international visas. Harvard, which has nearly 7,000 international students, argued that the ban would harm its educational mission and financial stability. The judge's decision provides temporary relief, but the case is ongoing.</p>
