          <p>The second week of Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial commenced with testimony from Dawn Richard, who recounted witnessing Combs striking Casandra "Cassie" Ventura. Kerry Morgan, Ventura's former best friend, corroborated these accounts, detailing instances of abuse she personally observed. David James, Combs' former assistant, described the demanding work environment, portraying Combs as the head of a kingdom where everyone was expected to serve, as the prosecution aims to establish a pattern of coercion and control. Prosecutors also released evidence from Ventura's testimony, showcasing injuries she allegedly sustained and a knife she purportedly used for protection, highlighting the severity of the accusations against Combs, who maintains his innocence.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has been referred to an independent commission by the Premier League for allegedly breaching EFL financial rules during the 2023-24 season when they were in the Championship. While a tribunal previously ruled that the Premier League couldn't punish Leicester for breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules for the 2022-23 season due to their relegation, it did grant the Premier League jurisdiction to investigate the EFL rule breach. The commission will also assess allegations that Leicester failed to provide accounts by December 31, 2024, and didn't fully cooperate with the Premier League's inquiries. Leicester stated they intend to cooperate with the investigation.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 16% in their Hong Kong debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest globally this year. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. This expansion coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs due to unfair trade practices, and allegations of CATL's ties to the Chinese military, which the company denies.</p>

          <p>Yuri Grigorovich, the acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer and former artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, has passed away at the age of 98. Grigorovich led the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, revitalizing male dance and creating roles demanding exceptional strength and artistry. His productions of "The Stone Flower," "Ivan the Terrible," and "Romeo and Juliet" redefined Soviet ballet. Grigorovich's departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first ever dancers' strike at the theatre in its 200-year history.</p>

          <p>During his presidency, Donald Trump sought a faster solution to the delayed Air Force One replacement program, leading to discussions about acquiring a luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar. The New York Times article details how the Trump administration considered accepting the plane as a gift, involving secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. While Trump characterized it as a "GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE," questions linger about the financial sense of refitting the plane and potential ethical concerns, as critics suggest it could be seen as currying favor with the administration. Despite the opulent interiors and Trump's initial enthusiasm, the arrangement faces condemnation and practical challenges, including the extensive retrofitting required to meet security standards.</p>

More than half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports to reduce reliance on China. This pricing strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to cover tariff costs. While Home Depot missed first-quarter earnings expectations, it beat sales estimates and maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating a 2.8% sales growth and a 1% increase in comparable sales, contingent on current tariff agreements remaining in place.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are warning of increased solar activity, including solar flares and storms, as an active region of the Sun rotates into view, potentially causing auroras and blackouts on Earth. NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory recently captured the most powerful eruption of 2025, an X2.7 flare, which triggered radio blackouts across parts of the Middle East. Ongoing flares and solar eruptions could impact radio communications, electric power grids, navigation signals, and pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.

          <p>Scientists warn that even if global warming is limited to 1.5C, sea levels could still rise significantly over the coming centuries, potentially causing major damage to coastlines. The researchers reviewed recent studies on ice sheet changes and past climate records, concluding that 1.5C should not be considered a "safe" level for coastal populations. Melting from Greenland and Antarctica is expected to continue even at this target due to the long-term impact of temperature changes on ice masses. Every fraction of a degree of warming avoided will still greatly limit the risks, as an estimated 230 million people live within one meter of current high tide lines.</p>

She emphasizes that such candor could restore trust with voters who feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate deportation protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This ruling lifts a hold placed by a California judge, enabling the administration to end protections and work permits for migrants with TPS, originally set to expire in October 2026, more than a year earlier in April 2025. The decision, which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, has drawn criticism from advocates who argue it will have significant humanitarian and economic consequences. The Trump administration is also expected to revoke TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians in August.</p>

The article highlights the central question: what did Democrats know about Biden's condition, and when did they know it? The books suggest that many in the party were aware of Biden's diminishment but chose to remain silent, driven by partisanship and fear of a Trump return. Instances of Biden's decline, simplified speeches, and the masking of his condition by his staff are all discussed. The review emphasizes the argument that Democrats prioritized political expediency over transparency, potentially harming the nation.</p>

Both men positioned themselves against the political establishment, championed conservative ideas, and appealed to blue-collar voters. Reagan's stance against the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy are cited as examples of his anti-establishment views, mirroring Trump's policies.

          <p>China's central bank reduced a key reference rate for mortgage loans by 10 basis points, a move aimed at stabilizing the country's struggling property market. The five-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered from 3.6% to 3.5%, while the one-year loan prime rate was also cut by 0.1 percentage points to 3.0%. This reduction is part of Beijing's broader efforts to revive the property sector, which has been a significant drag on the economy due to solvency issues among major real estate developers. The cut comes amid heightened external risks, particularly under Donald Trump's second presidency.</p>

          <p>A Texas showerhead salesman conducted an online experiment to gauge consumer interest in a more expensive 'Made in the USA' version of his product after tariffs on Asian imports increased. Despite over 25,000 website visitors, no one purchased the domestic version, priced $100 higher than the imported one, revealing a reluctance to pay more for American-made goods. The NPR article highlights the difficulties of competing with cheaper imports and the challenges faced by companies trying to manufacture in the U.S. due to higher costs and a dwindling supply of local suppliers, questioning the effectiveness of Trump's tariff policy in sparking a domestic manufacturing renaissance.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has imposed numerous tariffs on imports, particularly from China, collecting these tariffs effectively is proving challenging. The NPR article explains that incentives for smuggling have increased due to higher tariffs, leading to practices like transshipping, where goods are routed through third countries to evade taxes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces understaffing and a lack of resources to inspect and enforce tariff regulations, particularly with a surge in low-value packages. Business owners report that trade violations often go unpunished, and a proposed task force to prosecute trade fraud cases lacks funding and leadership.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary roll thruster on Voyager 1, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft. Voyager 1, launched in 1977, relies on these thrusters to maintain its antenna's alignment with Earth. The thrusters had been out of use for two decades due to a suspected electronics glitch, and engineers risked a potential explosion by attempting to reactivate them. This repair was crucial as the Deep Space Station 43, used to communicate with the Voyager probes, was scheduled to go offline for upgrades, limiting communication options. The successful revival ensures the spacecraft can continue its mission and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

Flinders admitted to the relationship, which began after sports day and involved multiple sexual encounters at the student's home. The TRA emphasized the importance of safeguarding children, even in 2000 when the term was not widely used, and determined that Flinders' conduct fell significantly short of expected professional standards.</p>
