          <p>The UK government is implementing a new crackdown on individuals claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, aiming to save £350 million over five years. Claimants abroad for more than eight weeks will generally lose eligibility, with a specialist team using travel data to identify non-compliant cases. This initiative follows a successful pilot that recovered £17 million, and is part of broader efforts to tackle rising benefit fraud, which reached an estimated £6.5 billion in 2024/25.</p>

The government will cover ongoing costs while seeking a buyer, emphasizing the strategic importance of domestic steel production. This move follows a similar intervention at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, highlighting the industry's struggles with high energy prices and foreign competition.</p>

          <p>Aid workers from various international organizations accuse their leadership of "whitewashing" the situation in Gaza by watering down public statements and avoiding terms like "occupation" or "accountability." This self-censorship reportedly intensified after Israel introduced a new NGO registration process requiring sensitive staff data, which many fear could endanger Palestinian personnel. The workers express frustration that their organizations prioritize maintaining operations over outspoken advocacy, potentially distorting the reality of the humanitarian crisis and hindering independent reporting.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK travelers are warned to expect significant disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend due to a combination of rail strikes and extensive engineering works.

          <p>Ukrainian author Andrey Kurkov reflects on European leaders' show of unity at the White House in support of Ukraine, viewing it as a positive counterpoint to the earlier Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska. While the meeting demonstrated continued European support and concern over Trump's unpredictable stance, Kurkov notes that a "fair peace," involving the liberation of seized territories, is increasingly a distant dream. He highlights Russia's continued aggression and President Putin's perceived unwillingness to negotiate substantively, underscoring the ongoing challenges to achieving a lasting resolution.</p>

          <h2>New Study Reveals How Corn Communicates and Adapts to Its Environment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This mechanism was identified through field surveys in Hainan, China, where densely planted corn showed reduced herbivore damage but also less growth. Researchers believe optimizing the release of linalool could offer new strategies to combat pests and increase crop yields. This finding sheds light on the complex evolutionary adaptations of corn.</p>

          <p>Colombia is experiencing a severe security crisis after two separate attacks killed at least 18 people and injured dozens. A car bomb in Cali killed six and wounded over 60 near a military aviation school, prompting martial law. Earlier, a drone attack downed a police helicopter, killing 12 officers on a coca eradication mission near Medellin. Both incidents are attributed to dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), posing significant challenges to the nation's fragile peace processes.</p>

          <p>Court filings in a legal dispute between Elon Musk and OpenAI reveal Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to help finance xAI's $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI in early 2025. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit, became incensed when it transitioned to a for-profit entity, leading him to launch xAI as a competitor. OpenAI's counter-claims allege Musk's bid was a "sham" and part of a harassment campaign. Zuckerberg and Meta did not sign the letter of intent, with Meta focusing on its own AI development.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company X have reached a tentative settlement with former employees who sued for $500 million in severance pay. The lawsuit alleged that approximately 6,000 staff, laid off after Musk's 2022 takeover, were wrongly denied benefits under the company's severance plan, receiving at most one month's pay or nothing. Both parties requested a postponement of an appeals court hearing to finalize the agreement.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest since March, though still higher than expected. This easing was primarily driven by a significant drop in rice inflation, which fell to 90.7% after two months of surging past 100%. Despite this, headline inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. Experts suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, potentially impacting purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>
