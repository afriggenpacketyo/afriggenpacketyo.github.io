          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares jumped almost 19% following better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, significantly boosted by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a resurgence in its e-commerce business. The company reported a 78% increase in net income, largely due to gains from equity investments and the disposal of Trendyol, despite a decrease in income from operations. Alibaba's cloud division, crucial for monetizing artificial intelligence, saw 26% year-on-year revenue growth, while AI-related product revenue maintained triple-digit growth. Investors are rewarding Alibaba's strategic investments in AI and new e-commerce models amid intense market competition, reflecting confidence in its long-term growth trajectory.

          <p>Preliminary Census Bureau data, analyzed by the Pew Research Center, reveals that over 1.2 million immigrants, encompassing both undocumented and legal residents, have departed the U.S. labor force from January through July under the Trump administration. This significant reduction follows a period where the overall immigrant population saw its first decline after peaking in 2023, sparking widespread concern about potential labor shortages across critical sectors such as agriculture, construction, and healthcare. Experts largely attribute this trend to intensified immigration enforcement and the pervasive fear of deportation, with reports detailing how ICE actions are disrupting various workplaces and communities nationwide. The article underscores the profound economic and social repercussions of these stricter immigration policies on the nation's vital workforce.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a broadly positive opening on Monday, with key indices such as Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 projected to see modest gains. This anticipated uptick follows a period of mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets, where investors closely analyzed China's August manufacturing data, and precedes a relatively quiet day for economic releases in Europe. Regional markets concluded last Friday with declines, as traders absorbed recent European and U.S. inflation figures and weighed the implications for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Furthermore, ongoing assessments of India-China relations, discussed at the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, are adding a significant geopolitical dimension to the current economic landscape.

The gathering, attended by over 20 foreign leaders including Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, saw Xi emphasize China's role as a global peacemaker amidst ongoing international tensions. He highlighted China's significant investments in other SCO countries and pledged support for vocational education programs. The article suggests that China's efforts to improve relations, particularly with India, could bolster Beijing's influence and further solidify a multipolar global order, with the summit expected to yield a joint statement on cooperation.</p>

          <p>Former England and Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney has voiced his opinion that the current season represents a critical "now or never" juncture for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. Rooney argues that after substantial investment in player acquisitions, the club's board and fanbase will now rightfully anticipate Arteta securing a league title. His remarks followed Arsenal's 1-0 defeat against Liverpool, a game where Rooney felt the Gunners could have emerged victorious had they displayed more tactical courage instead of playing "to not lose." Despite Arsenal's strong position, Rooney maintains that Liverpool remain the favorites for the Premier League title, citing their recent experience and "know-how" in winning the competition.</p>

The Serb's performance was notable despite receiving medical attention twice during the match for concerns related to his neck and right forearm, raising questions about his physical condition. This win is historically significant, as it makes the 38-year-old Djokovic the oldest player in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals at all four Grand Slam events within a single season.

While analysts predict the unveiling of previously unseen models, potentially presented in mixed formations to reflect realistic combat scenarios, experts generally believe these sophisticated systems will be featured in static displays for security considerations.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the issue of immigration is a constantly moving target for politicians, where no policy or crackdown ever fully appeases its opponents, as seen in both the UK and US. Despite Brexit ending free movement in the UK and significant border militarization under Trump in the US, new demands for stricter measures continuously emerge, creating an escalating cycle of enforcement. The author suggests that the focus often shifts from border control to internal deportations, potentially affecting even citizens in blended families, and warns that the underlying question is "how few is few enough," with an impossible answer of "fewer than zero." This critical perspective highlights the performative nature of some immigration policies and their far-reaching societal impacts.</p>

Prescott expressed contentment that the tension had been resolved, thus preventing further "headache and distraction" for the team. In return for Parsons, the Cowboys acquired two future first-round picks and All-Pro defensive tackle Kenny Clark, a strategic decision Jerry Jones framed as prioritizing both the team's immediate and long-term success.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly ordered state security for former Vice President Kamala Harris, following President Donald Trump's revocation of her extended Secret Service protection. Trump's action, ending protection just weeks before Harris's book tour, has been criticized as politically motivated. While Harris's office expressed gratitude to the Secret Service, Newsom's communications chief condemned the move as "erratic, vindictive political impulses." Law enforcement sources confirmed that the California Highway Patrol, potentially aided by LAPD, will provide protection, ensuring Harris's safety, particularly during her upcoming national and international public appearances. This article highlights a significant political maneuver and its implications for the security of a former high-ranking official.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 23:06:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private surveys indicate that U.S. tariffs have significantly impacted factory activity across Asia, with export powerhouses like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan experiencing contraction in August. This trend underscores the challenges faced by Asian manufacturers as they grapple with weakening exports and increased competition from cheap Chinese goods. In contrast, China's private manufacturing PMI unexpectedly expanded to 50.5, suggesting some resilience in external demand despite tariffs. However, analysts caution that this rebound is patchy, with weak domestic demand and slow profit recovery. The article emphasizes the intensifying hit from U.S. tariffs, particularly for countries reliant on U.S.-bound shipments, reinforcing pressure on policymakers to support economic recovery.

          <p>A homicide investigation is underway at the Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert after a man was found dead in a pool of blood on Saturday night. The discovery was made around the same time the festival's iconic "Man" effigy began to burn. Pershing County Sheriff's Office deputies confirmed the victim's death but did not release information on the cause or suspects, though they stated the act appeared to be a "singular crime." Authorities warned attendees to remain vigilant and indicated a "heavy law enforcement presence" would continue until the scene was released.

          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, alleges that Queen Camilla was the victim of an attempted sexual assault as a teenager, which she reportedly thwarted using her shoe. The incident is said to have occurred on a train to Paddington Station when she was 16 or 17, and she subsequently reported it, leading to the man's arrest. Buckingham Palace has not officially commented but is not disputing the account. The article notes that much of Queen Camilla's public work involves supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, though sources close to her state this personal experience did not directly motivate her advocacy, but rather her exposure to victims' stories over the years.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is poised to unveil tightened regulations concerning family reunion applications for migrants granted asylum in the UK, arguing that current policies are out of step with European neighbors. The forthcoming announcement in the Commons is expected to detail new criteria, including more stringent English language proficiency standards and requirements for family members to demonstrate access to adequate financial resources. Additionally, Cooper intends to introduce new legislation aimed at reforming the asylum appeals system, with a broader goal of ceasing the costly use of hotels for housing migrants and overhauling what she describes as a "broken" asylum system.

In a statement, Guatemala emphasized its desire to prevent children from remaining in shelters and detention centers, advocating for coordinated family reunification efforts and their inclusion in social programs back home. The government maintained that all actions prioritize children's human rights and due process. However, attorneys representing the children dispute the claim that parents uniformly requested repatriation, and criticize the U.S. government for attempting to deport children without allowing them to pursue asylum claims, deeming it unlawful and inhumane.</p>

The U.S. think tank CSIS reports that Vietnam is on track to surpass China in reclamation efforts, transforming pillboxes into sites for infrastructure like munitions storage. This ongoing work signals Vietnam's determination to solidify its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where rival claimants include China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Brunei. Maritime analysts suggest these actions, while unlikely to drastically alter the strategic balance, could prompt Beijing to enhance its own defense posture, potentially escalating regional tensions.</p>

The upcoming Monday drawing presents the potential winner with a choice between receiving periodic payments totaling the estimated $1.1 billion or opting for a lump sum payout of approximately $498.4 million, both calculated before taxes.
