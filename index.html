          <p>Tesla is promoting its lidar-free self-driving system in China, emphasizing its reliance on visual processing solutions to achieve safer autonomous driving in various scenarios. The company asserts that advanced technology does not require expensive sensors like lidar, which CEO Elon Musk has previously dismissed as unnecessary due to high production costs. Despite Musk's skepticism, lidar sensors are expected to be fitted in one out of every four new cars in China this year. This initiative underscores Tesla's strategy to navigate the Chinese market while awaiting Beijingâ€™s approval for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently averaging 6.11% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.89% for a 30-year mortgage as of May 5, 2025, according to national averages. Refinance rates are similar, with 15-year refinances at 6.12% and 30-year refinances at 6.86%. Experts suggest that borrowers can secure better rates by improving their credit scores and shopping around for different lenders. While rates are higher than in previous years, potential relief may come if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, making borrowing more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has approved plans to escalate the military campaign in Gaza, with Prime Minister Netanyahu declaring that the war is not finished and will be pursued with a unified military and resolved soldiers. However, questions remain about whether an increased military presence will fundamentally alter the dynamic of the conflict, as previous efforts have not achieved the goals of destroying Hamas or releasing all hostages. Experts suggest that overwhelming force has been exhausted and that ending the war with a weakened Hamas might be a more effective strategy. Concerns are also rising among families of hostages, who fear that expanded military operations will put their loved ones at greater risk.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a dip after Warren Buffett announced his plans to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel set to replace him on January 1, 2026. Despite the initial market reaction, shareholders are confident that Buffett's continued role as chairman will ensure a smooth transition and maintain the company's strategic direction. This marks the end of Buffett's 60-year tenure, during which he transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <h2>New York Times Op-Ed: Presidential Power Needs Reform After Trump's Second Term</h2>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's second term, which revealed the full latent power of the presidency through the elimination of legal and norm-based checks, it is argued that the presidency needs reform. The author, Jack Goldsmith, notes that Trump's actions build on the excesses of recent presidencies, creating a dangerous escalation of power grabs. He suggests considering limitations on the presidency through judicial review, congressional action, and even a constitutional amendment to define and constrain the executive branch, emphasizing the need for leaders with incorporated checks and balances.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices declined after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for the second consecutive month, adding 411,000 barrels per day in June. This decision, following a similar increase in May, has led to concerns about an oversupplied market amid fears of a recession. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices to average $56 and $60 per barrel, respectively, this year. Oilfield service firms anticipate a decline in exploration and production investment due to the weak price environment.</p>
