          <p>Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was deported from Israel after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound aid boat in the Mediterranean. Thunberg and 11 others were attempting to deliver a symbolic amount of aid to Gaza, defying Israel's maritime blockade and highlighting the humanitarian crisis. The Israeli foreign ministry dismissed the effort as a "selfie yacht" and transferred the passengers to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition demanded the immediate release of all volunteers and the return of the seized aid, asserting that their kidnapping was unlawful and a violation of international law. The aid, including baby formula and medicine, will be transferred to Gaza through official humanitarian channels.</p>

          <p>IBM announced its roadmap for developing a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer named Quantum Starling, with the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor slated for release later this year. The company aims to create a device capable of running larger, deeper circuits with hundreds of millions of gates operating on hundreds of qubits, while also correcting errors and preventing their spread throughout the system. This announcement follows recent advancements in quantum computing by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. IBM's focus on fault tolerance underscores the growing importance of error correction in the pursuit of practical quantum computing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares debt forgiveness (debt settlement) and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. The article includes a cost comparison showing potential savings for each strategy, but notes that debt forgiveness can significantly damage your credit score. The article concludes that the best option depends on individual circumstances, with debt consolidation being preferable for those who can qualify and manage payments, while debt forgiveness may be a last resort for unmanageable debt (not investment advice).</p>
