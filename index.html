            <p>President Donald Trump announced that his administration is moving towards making it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections and reclassifying them as "at-will" employees. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 federal workers and aims to hold them to the highest standards of conduct and performance. According to the White House, the workers are not required to personally or politically support the President, but must faithfully implement the law and the administration's policies. The change would require Trump to sign an executive order after the Office of Personnel Management issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, directing the Trump administration not to remove individuals held at the Bluebonnet Detention Center. This decision follows an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the Act. The ACLU had sued to block the deportations, warning that immigration authorities were accusing Venezuelan men of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, making them subject to the Act, which has only been invoked three times in U.S. history.</p>

            <p>Mazyar Azarbonyad, a personal trainer, admitted to dangerous driving after leading police on a chase that resulted in a pile-up involving five police cars and injuries to seven officers. Azarbonyad sped away from officers in Gateshead after they noticed a defective rear light on his BMW, and he later admitted to driving without insurance and a license. The court heard that the crash occurred on the A1 near the Denton roundabout after an unmarked police Volvo collided with Azarbonyad's vehicle. Azarbonyad was granted conditional bail and is due to be sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court on May 20.</p>

His campaign has gained momentum through grassroots efforts and a focus on affordability and community safety.

Bush with the unchanging significance of Easter. While presidents and political stages are temporary, Christ's influence is permanent and transformative. The author emphasizes that presidents hold borrowed power, while Christ doesn't borrow anything, and when Christ enters a life, He stays. The article concludes by celebrating the eternal promise sealed by Jesus' blood and resurrection, offering hope and a source of true power.</p>

            <p>Steve Coogan highlights a growing trend of voters supporting right-wing candidates due to financial security and a desire for lower taxes and reduced regulations. This new social contract prioritizes the interests of affluent baby boomers, who seek to maintain their wealth and keep the less fortunate out of sight. Academics have found that financial security reduces risk aversion, making voters more tolerant of radical policies. The article suggests that this shift is driven by a desire for status and a feeling of being left out by society, rather than solely by economic circumstances.</p>

            <p>The Menendez brothers' hopes for release after serving over three decades in prison for the 1989 slayings of their parents have been delayed again. A judge postponed proceedings to review their request for resentencing due to disputes between the defense and prosecution. The brothers, who claim they feared their parents were going to kill them to cover up years of abuse, have garnered public support and a recommendation for resentencing from the former Los Angeles district attorney. However, the new district attorney opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers have not taken full responsibility and were not abused.</p>

            <p>Xavier Becerra, former US health and human services secretary, is vying for California's governorship, emphasizing his experience in challenging Donald Trump's policies. Becerra aims to restore the “California dream” by addressing affordability and the housing crisis. He enters a competitive field of Democratic candidates, including Katie Porter and Antonio Villaraigosa, while Kamala Harris's potential candidacy looms large. Becerra vows to continue his campaign regardless, focusing on shaking up the system rather than the people amid economic uncertainty.</p>

            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has condemned new US port fees targeting Chinese-owned, operated, or built vessels, vowing to retaliate against what it deems discriminatory measures. The ministry described the fees as "typical non-market practices with obvious discriminatory characteristics" that harm Chinese companies and disrupt global supply chains. The US administration finalized the fees to bolster the domestic shipbuilding industry and curb Chinese dominance. Chinese operators will face fees starting at US$50 per net ton, increasing to US$140 by 2028, while Chinese-built vessels will have lower fees.</p>

            <p>A literacy expert outlines five key strategies that parents use to foster successful reading habits in their children. These include treating baby babble as conversation, asking questions and allowing time for answers, focusing on letter sounds rather than just names, engaging in word play, and seizing readable moments throughout the day. Strong reading skills in elementary school are a predictor of long-term success, leading to better education, jobs, and earnings. By implementing these techniques, parents can significantly enhance their children's literacy development.</p>

            <p>A GOBankingRates analysis reveals that $2 million in retirement savings, combined with Social Security, can last from 23 years in Hawaii to 72 years in West Virginia, largely due to cost of living differences. High housing costs in states like California, New York, and Massachusetts necessitate more savings to maintain lifestyles. The analysis, based on BLS data and the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center's cost-of-living index, shows that $2 million covers over 35 years of retirement in most states. While only a small percentage of households have this much saved, it aligns with many people's retirement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Due to the Trump administration's crackdown on legal and illegal border crossings, a reversal in migration patterns has emerged in Central America, with more people moving south. Costa Rica, traditionally a transit country for migrants heading to the U.S., now sees an influx of migrants seeking refuge there, overwhelming its asylum system. Migrants cite the difficulty of entering the U.S. and dangerous conditions in Mexico as reasons for turning back. The shift could destabilize the region, impacting U.S. interests and tarnishing its legacy as a refuge for persecuted people.</p>

            <p>Economists are warning of increasing stagflation risks, characterized by rising inflation, slower economic growth, and high unemployment, potentially fueled by the Trump administration's tariff policies. This could lead to slower income growth, reduced employment prospects, and higher prices, making it harder for households to manage their budgets. Experts recommend paying down high-interest debt, building an emergency fund, and considering strategic purchases while being cautious about panic buying.

            <p>Rising water temperatures in rivers, such as the Beaver Kill in New York's Catskill Mountains, threaten fish populations and the economies that depend on them. Fly fishing, a $750 million industry, is at risk as climate change warms rivers and reduces oxygen levels. Efforts to restore river flow by removing sediment and clearing old dams aim to cool the water and create a more hospitable environment for fish. These initiatives benefit not only the fish but also the people and communities that rely on recreational activities supported by healthy river ecosystems.</p>

Elliott's involvement could drive value creation by improving management execution, integrating Juniper Networks, and enhancing capital allocation. The firm's history of strategic activism in the technology sector suggests potential for significant returns, especially with board representation.
