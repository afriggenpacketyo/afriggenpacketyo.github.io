          <p>China's retail sales growth in April slowed to 5.1%, missing analysts' estimates and indicating persistent concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. While industrial output exceeded expectations, the real estate sector continued to decline, impacting fixed-asset investment. The statistics bureau acknowledged ongoing instability and uncertainty in the external environment, emphasizing the need to consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. Despite trade war fears receding after recent negotiations, the data suggests China's economic recovery faces challenges.</p>

Conservatives are pushing for Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while some Republicans from blue states are demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions.

Critics, including Democratic leader Chris Murphy, have labeled the gift as a form of corruption, while some of Trump's allies view it as a contradiction of his promise to 'drain the swamp'. Trump has defended the gift, claiming it was for the United States and not for him personally, a claim disputed by Murphy.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones at age 82. The former president's cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, which places him in Grade Group 5, the most severe category. Symptoms, treatments, and the implications of bone metastasis are being closely examined. The goal of treatment is to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. Hormone-sensitive treatment is expected to be the primary approach.</p>

          <p>The United States is considering implementing region-based tariffs instead of individual duty rates for many countries, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. With the deadline for negotiating trade deals approaching, the Trump administration is focusing on striking deals with key trading partners on its sweeping reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. The administration paused country-specific tariffs for 90 days until early July to allow for negotiations, but progress has been challenging.

While the number of fires has decreased due to improved firefighting capabilities, the fires are becoming larger and more devastating.

To push back against the dollar, China must "deepen" its financial markets so foreigners can better access yuan-denominated stocks, bonds and other assets. The economist cited China's existing "connect" schemes with Hong Kong as a model, through which foreign investors can buy mainland Chinese bonds and stocks without special licences.</p>
