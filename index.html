          <h2>Trump Receives Lavish Welcome and Economic Pledges During Middle East Tour</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and immigration. During the trip, Trump secured over $2 trillion in economic investments from these nations, including deals for Boeing jets and G.E. engines, with potential investments reaching $4 trillion. He also used a stop at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as a campaign-style rally, praising his administration's policies and falsely claiming victory in the 2020 election. The article emphasizes the transactional nature of the relationships and the absence of protests, a stark contrast to the receptions Trump might receive in Europe or Latin America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear that President Trump's tariffs on goods exported to the United States will devastate their industry. The United States' appetite for guns has long provided a steady market for Gorazdeâ€™s weapons factories, but the newly announced tariffs threaten to halt exports. Ginex, a local company that makes ignition devices used in ammunition, has stalled expansion plans and risks scaring off American customers, as the tariffs could more than double the previous rate. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the United States has abandoned free trade and economic development as a path to peace in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge, Hannah Dugan, pleaded not guilty to federal charges for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts involving Judge Shelley Joseph. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape through a back door of a courtroom to avoid an ICE agent. While Dugan's case was fast-tracked, Joseph's case took over a year to develop, highlighting the rarity and potential political motivations behind such prosecutions. The article explores the debate over federal overreach and the balance between state judicial independence and federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is significantly increasing its investments and influence across Africa, filling a void as the United States and China reduce their presence on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, critical minerals, and renewable energy projects, with announced deals totaling $110 billion since 2019. While the U.S. reduces its funding and dismantles agencies like U.S.A.I.D., the Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, seeing Africa as essential due to its vast resources and strategic location. However, the Emirates' political choices, such as its involvement in Sudan, have raised concerns.</p>

Mayor Cara Spencer reported that over 5,000 homes were affected, and approximately 100,000 customers were without electricity.

The children gradually began to trust and interact with the staff, eventually showing signs of normalcy and a desire for affection. Hosaka reflects on the challenges of reintegrating the children into society and the lasting impact of the cult's denial of the parent-child relationship.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio from President Joe Bidenâ€™s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, reigniting concerns about his mental acuity. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall the date of his son Beau's death and mixing up the year of Trump's election victory. This supports Hur's conclusion that Biden's memory was "significantly limited," leading to descriptions of Biden as a "well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory." The release has sparked criticism, with some commentators questioning Biden's capability to serve as commander-in-chief.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in court, stating she would return a $20 million settlement from Sean "Diddy" Combs if it meant she never participated in drug-fueled sexual encounters, which she described as humiliating. She rejected the notion that her accusations were financially driven and provided graphic details about her relationship with Combs, including allegations of physical violence. Combs' lawyers attempted to portray Ventura as a willing participant in the sexual lifestyle, but she maintained she was coerced due to threats of violence, adding the "freak offs" caused her physical injuries, would sometimes go on for days, and stifled her career as a singer.</p>
