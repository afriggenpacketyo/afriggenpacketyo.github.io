          <p>Japan and NATO have agreed to deepen their collaboration on pressing global security issues, including the Middle East crisis, the war in Ukraine, and North Korea's abductions of Japanese citizens. During discussions in The Hague, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte committed to elevating cooperation in defense industries and other sectors. This agreement highlights the strengthening ties between Japan and NATO as they address shared security concerns amid geopolitical instability. The collaboration signifies a united front in tackling complex international challenges and fostering greater stability. Optimism is moderate as the commitment to cooperation is positive but the issues remain complex.</p>

Lallana expressed gratitude for his career, highlighting the highs and lows that shaped him, and thanked his family, teammates, coaches, and supporters. The news is bittersweet, celebrating a successful career while acknowledging its end.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders are expected to release a joint statement regarding a proposed increase in collective defense spending, aiming to reach 5% of each member nation's GDP by 2035. Despite some member states struggling to meet the current 2% target, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed confidence in the commitment to higher spending, citing the threat from Russia and the international security situation. The United States' commitment to NATO remains a focal point, with President Trump questioning Article 5, the collective defense clause, while Rutte reassured allies of Washington's continued support. While the move towards increased spending demonstrates a serious approach to defense, potential disagreements among member states add uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg won the Democratic primary, defeating his moderate challenger Patrick Timmins. Bragg, known for his legal battles with President Donald Trump, secured over 70% of the vote. Prior to his re-election, Bragg's office had convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records, related to a payment made to Stormy Daniels. Bragg's office had requested a stay in the case until 2029, but Merchan ultimately sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge, preserving his ability to appeal the conviction. The election results reflect the political landscape in Manhattan and Bragg's continued support.</p>

Despite his colleagues' rescue efforts, Zhang died, and China's foreign ministry has praised his actions as an embodiment of China-Africa ties and the dedication of Chinese medical teams.

Purchase demand remains historically low, though it is 11% higher than the same week last year.

          <p>The recent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites have led to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, though the situation remains unresolved. Iran retaliated against the U.S. with advance notice, and President Trump announced the cease-fire, but confusion remains due to the lack of a formal agreement. Israel demonstrated its intelligence capabilities but failed to fully destroy Iran's nuclear program, while Iran's regime proved resilient but suffered significant damage. The cease-fire may lead to renewed talks on limiting Iran's nuclear program, though hard-liners continue to push for rejectionism. The analysis suggests a complex and uncertain future for the region.</p>

Trump's visit to the summit followed his announcement of the ceasefire, which occurred after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While Trump has asserted the strikes effectively halted Iran's nuclear weapons development, intelligence assessments suggest limited damage, setting Tehran's program back only a few months. At the summit, NATO allies are discussing a new commitment for countries to allocate 5% of their GDP to defense spending by 2035, with Trump expressing ambivalence about Article 5, the mutual defense clause.

          <p>The House and Senate are considering a "big beautiful" bill that proposes new federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The proposals would require individuals aged 19 to 64 to work or participate in qualifying activities for 80 hours per month to be eligible for Medicaid. Exemptions would be available for those with dependent children or qualifying circumstances, but some worry these exemptions may not be sufficient. The House version of the bill would cut federal spending by $344 billion over 10 years, but there are concerns about the impact on those who may lose coverage.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest President Trump's tax-cut legislation would shift wealth from younger to older Americans, despite some tax breaks for younger individuals. The bill's $3 trillion addition to the national debt is expected to push up interest rates and burden future generations with higher taxes and mortgage payments. While Republicans argue the bill would boost economic growth and entrepreneurship, analysts contend that the debt burden would outweigh any benefits for younger workers. The plan raises concerns about intergenerational equity and the long-term financial well-being of younger Americans. (not investment advice)</p>
