          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, has appointed eight new advisors to the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous 17 members. The selections circumvent the usual CDC vetting process, and include individuals who have publicly criticized vaccine recommendations and questioned their safety. Among the appointees are Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff, who criticized COVID-19 restrictions. This move has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the future of vaccine policy and public health. The optimism score is not related to any personal injuries, deaths, or governmental financial regulations, so the summary does not contain the disclaimer. </p>

          <p>All twelve members of the Fulbright scholarship board resigned in protest of the Trump administration's alleged interference with the selection of award recipients. The board members stated that the administration denied awards to several individuals already chosen and initiated an unauthorized review process for 1,200 foreign award recipients. They believe the administration's actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence. The State Department defended the administration's actions, stating the board members were partisan political appointees attempting to undermine President Trump. </p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines in the UK are dominated by reactions to the chancellor's Spending Review, with varying perspectives on its impact. Some papers, like the Daily Express, warn of impending tax increases due to increased NHS spending, while others, such as the Daily Mail, criticize the review as a reckless splurge. The Guardian highlights the NHS and defense as major beneficiaries, while the Daily Telegraph argues that the police and defense are being sacrificed. The Financial Times notes that the Home Office, Foreign Office, and Culture Department face a squeeze, and the i Paper suggests that council tax is likely to rise due to funding cuts for the police. </p>

Trump vowed to use military force to suppress what he termed "anarchy" and promised to "liberate" Los Angeles, where protests against immigration policies are ongoing.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's clash with President Trump over immigration enforcement efforts presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the governor.
