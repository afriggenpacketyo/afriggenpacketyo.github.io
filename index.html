            <p>President Donald Trump is increasingly emphasizing the role of faith in his presidency, particularly after surviving an assassination attempt last year. He believes his life was saved by God to make America great again and often credits his Presbyterian upbringing for instilling his morality and sense of destiny. Trump warns of America's spiritual decline and advocates for religious liberty as a cornerstone of his leadership. He consistently links America's founding ideals to faith and views his presidency as fulfilling a divine mission.</p>

            <p>More than 100 civilians, including aid workers and children, have been killed in attacks on displaced persons camps in Sudan's Darfur region. The attacks, blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), targeted camps near el-Fasher, the last major town in Darfur under army control. Aid organizations report a targeted assault on health infrastructure, preventing access to healthcare for internally displaced people. The war between the army and the RSF has created a humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and pushing communities into famine.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is undergoing a retrial after a judge's misstep in the initial suit. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin's attorneys argue falsely accused her of inciting violence. The retrial provides a rare opportunity for Palin to challenge protections for the press, though she faces an uphill battle due to the high bar for proving defamation for public figures. The media landscape has shifted since the first trial, with other outlets settling similar cases.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee uses Sam Peckinpah's 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' as a lens to examine the current political climate, particularly the influence of Donald Trump. He argues that the film's themes of freedom under attack from big business and the choice between integrity and survival resonate strongly in 2025. Lee connects the film's themes to contemporary issues like tariffs, political transactions, and the rise of authoritarian figures, finding a renewed relevance in Peckinpah's once-reviled masterpiece.</p>

            <p>The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, aimed at reforming voter registration, is facing scrutiny over its potential impact on married women. The bill requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, which could pose challenges for women who have changed their last names and lack matching birth certificates. Opponents argue it could disenfranchise millions, while supporters claim states will accommodate discrepancies with secondary documents. Legal experts worry about varying enforcement across states and potential administrative burdens for married individuals.</p>

            <p>President Trump's use of executive orders to punish law firms he accuses of undermining national interests is raising concerns about the chilling effect on pro bono work. These firms often represent causes unpopular with the administration, and some have been involved in investigations of Trump himself. Civil rights organizations fear firms will pull back from politically sensitive cases, limiting challenges to potentially unconstitutional actions. Some attorneys report increasing political considerations in firms' decisions about pro bono assistance, impacting their ability to bring cases and allocate resources.</p>
