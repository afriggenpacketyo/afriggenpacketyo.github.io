        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England staged a remarkable recovery led by Jamie Smith's incredible 184-run innings. He and Harry Brook formed a massive 303-run partnership, rescuing England after an early collapse. Despite their efforts, India's bowlers, particularly Mohammed Siraj, struck back with the new ball to dismiss England for 407, securing a significant first-innings lead of 180. With India extending their overall lead to 244 by the end of day three, they remain in a commanding position to level the series, though England's reputation for high-stakes run chases sets up a potentially thrilling conclusion to the match.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapsed in Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Rescue operations are ongoing, with emergency services struggling to find survivors amidst the rubble, though their efforts are hampered by narrow streets. Officials confirmed at least seven fatalities, with concerns that more people remain trapped as the building housed up to 100 residents. Building collapses are a recurring issue in Pakistan, frequently attributed to lax construction regulations and insufficient oversight, prompting calls from political leaders for an investigation and preventative measures.</p>

          <h2>UK House of Lords Debates Ending 'Unjust' Indefinite Prison Sentences</h2>

          <p>Members of the UK's House of Lords have strongly criticized the government's failure to address the plight of prisoners serving Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentences. These indefinite jail terms were abolished in 2012, but the change was not retroactive, leaving over 2,500 individuals incarcerated without a release date for crimes that now carry fixed sentences. Peers described the situation as a "miscarriage of justice" and an "industrial-scale scandal," highlighting cases of individuals serving decades beyond their original minimum tariffs. While the government maintains its priority is public protection, it has promised to explore operational solutions to the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed optimism for a strong performance at the British Grand Prix after a competitive showing during Friday's practice sessions at Silverstone. Driving for Ferrari, Hamilton was among the top contenders, finishing third fastest behind McLaren's Lando Norris and his teammate Charles Leclerc. This performance is particularly encouraging for the team as rivals McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades for the weekend. Hamilton noted he is feeling more comfortable in the car and believes they can challenge for a top result, though he acknowledged that changing weather conditions could play a significant role in the upcoming qualifying and race.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a new left-wing political party in the UK has gained attention following MP Zarah Sultana's departure from Labour and her call to launch a new movement with Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, he indicated that discussions for a new party are still in the early stages and no formal launch has been planned. Polling suggests such a party could capture around 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters. Analysts believe this potential new entity could significantly impact the UK's political landscape, challenging both Labour and the Greens by appealing to progressive voters disillusioned with the current options.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has denied a request to temporarily block the UK government from banning the direct-action group Palestine Action, allowing its proscription as a terrorist organization to proceed. This decision makes supporting the group a criminal offense, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The ban was initiated after the group claimed responsibility for causing an estimated £7 million in damages to aircraft at RAF Brize Norton. The group's co-founder condemned the move as an "authoritarian abuse" of power and stated they will pursue an urgent appeal, arguing it criminalizes a civil disobedience group that does not advocate for violence.</p>

The investigation has revealed that the company lacked the required local licenses to store fireworks on the agricultural property.

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Donald Trump proposed a novel idea for celebrating America's 250th anniversary next year: hosting a UFC championship fight on the White House grounds. Trump suggested an octagon could be set up to accommodate a large crowd of 20,000 to 25,000 people for a full championship event. He stated that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be responsible for organizing the fight. The proposal is unprecedented, as a major sporting event of this nature has never been held at the White House.

The lawmakers condemned the denial of access as an "abuse of power" intended to hide potential human rights violations.

          <p>Health experts are examining the potential short-term and long-term health consequences of competitive eating, a sport with unknown lasting effects. A 2007 study revealed that a competitive eater's stomach can expand massively to hold food, appearing like a "food-filled sac" with little digestive movement. Gastroenterologists warn this could lead to a permanently stretched stomach that doesn't contract properly, impacting gastric emptying. Besides extreme bloating and fatigue, participants face risks from consuming vast amounts of high-sodium, high-fat food, which can spike blood pressure and cause gastrointestinal distress. The most severe dangers include choking, aspiration, or tearing the esophagus.</p>

Organizations like the Anti-Defamation League called the language "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that such words from a leader normalize harmful stereotypes.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a civil complaint detailing a scam where perpetrators stole over $250,000 in cryptocurrency by impersonating the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. The scammers used fraudulent email addresses, cleverly mimicking the official domain, to trick a victim into sending the funds as a purported donation. The complaint states the emails, sent in December, appeared to be from the committee's co-chair. The U.S. government is now seeking the permanent seizure of nearly $40,400 of the stolen funds that have been recovered from a Binance account. The remaining cryptocurrency was quickly transferred to numerous other addresses, complicating recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK Attorney General's Office has referred the sentence of a 15-year-old boy, convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli, to the Court of Appeal for being potentially unduly lenient. Mr. Kohli died after being racially abused and physically attacked by the teenager in a park in Leicestershire. The boy received a seven-year custody sentence, while a 13-year-old girl who filmed the attack received a non-custodial order. The victim's family expressed disappointment with the original sentences, and local MPs have campaigned for a review, arguing the punishment does not fit the severity of the crime.</p>

The attack, which killed at least one person and injured over 20, damaged residential buildings, schools, and infrastructure. The bombardment occurred shortly after President Trump held separate, unproductive phone calls with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy described his conversation with Trump as useful, stating they agreed to work on enhancing Ukraine's air defense capabilities, a critical need as Russia intensifies its bombing campaign across the country.</p>

          <p>The ACLU and other legal groups have filed a federal class-action lawsuit against U.S. immigration agencies, alleging that agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling. The suit claims that agents are targeting people based on their appearance and location, such as Latino day laborers, and conducting indiscriminate raids without reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit provides examples of agents detaining and arresting individuals, including U.S. citizens, without first determining their immigration status. While the Department of Homeland Security denies the allegations, advocates argue that ambitious arrest quotas are pressuring agents to cut corners and violate constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign a landmark policy package into law after it narrowly passed Congress, enacting key elements of his agenda. The 870-page bill extends his first-term tax cuts, increases defense spending by $150 billion, and provides $100 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, while also cutting Medicaid spending and clean energy credits. The legislation has been highly divisive, with Republicans supporting its potential for economic growth and Democrats warning it will primarily benefit the wealthy. Analysis from the Congressional Budget Office suggests the bill could increase the budget deficit after an initial surplus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a hopeful effort to combat the effects of climate change, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef in Miami that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral, involves crossbreeding Florida's native Elkhorn corals with a more heat-tolerant variety from Honduras. The Honduran corals thrive in waters that are significantly warmer, similar to conditions Florida's reefs are expected to face in the future. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef restoration across the Caribbean.</p>

This private admission appears to contradict China's public stance of neutrality and suggests a preference for a prolonged conflict that occupies U.S. attention.

          <p>Following Germany's decision to significantly increase its defense budget, economists are expressing skepticism about whether the spending will deliver a substantial boost to the broader economy. A study from the University of Mannheim suggests the economic stimulus from military spending will be moderate, with each euro of government spending generating a maximum of only 50 cents in additional economic activity. This is a much lower return compared to investments in infrastructure or education. Critics warn that with defense contractors already at full capacity, the spending spree is more likely to increase corporate profits and prices than to generate widespread economic growth.
