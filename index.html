          <p>England's Lionesses received widespread praise after securing a dramatic Euro 2025 victory against Spain. King Charles celebrated the team for making the "football's coming home" chant a reality through their skill and teamwork. Prince William and Princess Charlotte, who attended the final in Switzerland, expressed their immense pride in the team's historic achievement. The win marks the first time an England team has won a major trophy away from home, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer lauded the players as "history makers."</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential tariff escalation. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the accord, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments. While some products like aircraft and pharmaceuticals are exempt, the agreement aims to bring stability to the transatlantic trading relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old darts player Luke Littler has achieved a historic Triple Crown by winning the World Matchplay final against veteran James Wade.

Despite an early 5-0 deficit, Littler mounted a powerful comeback, showcasing high-quality play with 17 maximums of 180. The win cements his status as a dominant new force in the sport.</p>

He asserted that the administration's focus is on what it deems fiscal mismanagement at the Fed, such as an office renovation project.

The attack was halted when multiple citizens, including one armed with a pistol, confronted the suspect in the parking lot until a deputy arrived.

Despite the pause, medics reported nine people killed by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route.

          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by CBS has ignited a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While some view the move as a one-off financial decision by parent company Paramount, others see it as a sign of decline for the genre, which faces rising production costs and shrinking advertising revenue from linear TV. The article suggests that the future of other shows, like ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," will be a key indicator of the industry's direction. The analysis points to shifting viewer habits and economic pressures reshaping the entertainment landscape.</p>

          <p>White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has not ruled out seeking further spending cuts before September using the controversial rescissions process. Vought confirmed his office is considering a package to claw back funds from the Department of Education, following a recent successful $10 billion rescission of foreign aid and public media funding. This approach is viewed by critics in both parties as an executive overreach into Congress's constitutional power of the purse. The tactic creates further uncertainty around government funding negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by Ezra Klein suggests the Jeffrey Epstein controversy creates a significant political dilemma for Donald Trump by turning his own tactics against him. Having long profited from promoting conspiracy theories about a "deep state," Trump now presides over that state and is being pressured by his own base to reveal secrets he may not have or may not want to release. The article argues that whatever Trump does to deflect only deepens suspicion, especially given his past association with Epstein. This dynamic puts him in a difficult position with a base that is highly distrustful of official narratives.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic criticizes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for signing a law that weakened the country's anti-corruption agencies, a move he later reversed after public outcry. The author argues this action was a betrayal of democratic principles, allegedly done to protect political allies from investigation. The article frames this within a broader context of the Trump administration's perceived tolerance for global corruption, suggesting it has removed international pressure for good governance. It posits that even respected leaders like Zelensky may be seizing the opportunity to weaken accountability.</p>
