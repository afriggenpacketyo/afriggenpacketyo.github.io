          <h2>SEC Voluntarily Dismisses Lawsuit Against Binance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal is seen as a symbolic conclusion to an aggressive crypto crackdown in the U.S., especially with the Trump administration showing support for the industry, such as the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission set to be led by a venture capitalist with close ties to crypto. The SEC's motion was granted with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be revived, which is unlikely given the current administration's stance. Optimism score cannot be derived from this article.

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The administration had warned it would seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariffs were not quickly reinstated. The appeals court's decision provides the administration some time to argue for a longer stay during the appeals process. Trump officials assert they have alternative methods for imposing tariffs if they don't win the case, while critics claim the tariffs inflict irreparable harm on businesses. The court will review the arguments in the coming weeks. Optimism score cannot be derived from this article. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a recent New York Yankees game, a fan wearing an Aaron Judge jersey ran onto the field in the bottom of the seventh inning, managing to evade security before being apprehended. The fan recorded the escapade on his phone, sprinting from center to right field and even juking a security guard in front of right fielder Cody Bellinger.

          <p>This article explains tariffs, which are taxes on goods bought from other countries, and their impact on the U.S. economy under President Trump. Trump argues tariffs will boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit, while critics contend they will raise prices for U.S. consumers. The article details tariffs imposed on the European Union, China, and the UK, including recent agreements for reductions and exemptions. The piece also touches on the legal challenges to Trump's tariffs, with a U.S. trade court initially blocking the sweeping import taxes before an appeals court allowed them to stay in place while the case is litigated.

          <p>President Trump reacted sharply to a reporter's question about the "TACO trade" meme, which stands for "Trump always chickens out," a term coined by a Financial Times columnist to mock his shifting tariff policies. The phrase suggests that investors profit by buying stocks when Trump announces tariffs and then selling when he delays or reduces them. Trump defended his decisions to slash tariffs on China and postpone tariffs on European Union countries, visibly agitated by the reporter's question, which he deemed "nasty." He maintained that his actions helped China avoid economic difficulty, despite critics arguing that his tariff policies disrupt global commerce.

          <p>The State Department is planning a major reorganization involving the elimination of around 3,400 jobs and the closure or consolidation of nearly half of its domestic offices. This is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing the department as "bloated." The reorganization aims to create a more agile department, with some departments focused on democracy and human rights being scrapped or consolidated. A new senior job focused on "Democracy & Western Values" will be added, while offices handling migration issues will focus on returning illegal aliens. The plan also eliminates a program assisting Afghans who aided U.S. military personnel, drawing criticism. Optimism score cannot be derived from this article.</p>

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a lawsuit against the White House for failing to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at press briefings. The lawsuit alleges that the White House stopped providing ASL interpreters when President Trump returned to office, violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. The NAD argues that English closed captioning is insufficient for many deaf and hard of hearing individuals who primarily communicate in ASL.
