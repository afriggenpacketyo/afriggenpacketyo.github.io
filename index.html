          <p>Economists anticipate a slowdown in hiring for May, with predictions of around 125,000 new jobs, a decrease from April's 177,000.

Data this week from ADP showed that private payrolls essentially were flat last month, growing by just 37,000 in May, a two-year low, and jobless claims have also been edging higher.
