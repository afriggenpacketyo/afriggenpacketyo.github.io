          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has advanced to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon after a grueling five-set victory over Nicolas Jarry. Norrie initially led by two sets and held a match point in the third before Jarry mounted a strong comeback, pushing the match to a decisive fifth set. After four hours and 27 minutes, Norrie secured the win, keeping British hopes alive in the singles tournament at the All England Club. His victory sets up a potential quarter-final match against reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz, as Norrie aims to replicate his 2022 semi-final run.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash flooding in Texas has tragically risen to at least 70, with officials confirming that many of the deceased are children. In response to the disaster, which has devastated areas like Kerr County, a federal major disaster declaration has been signed to expedite resources for first responders. The Department of Homeland Security is coordinating with state and local leaders, and the U.S. Coast Guard is actively involved in search-and-rescue missions. These efforts are focused on locating survivors and accounting for those still missing, including campers from the Guadalupe River area.</p>

          <p>A match at Wimbledon experienced significant controversy after the electronic line-calling system failed during a critical point. In the fourth-round match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal, the system did not make a call on a ball that was visibly out, leading the chair umpire to order a replay of the point. Pavlyuchenkova expressed extreme frustration, stating a game was 'stolen' from her, and questioned why the umpire didn't make the call manually. The All England Club later attributed the malfunction to operator error, highlighting the ongoing debates around the reliability of automated officiating in high-stakes professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, named the 'America Party,' following a public falling out with President Donald Trump. The move comes after Musk, who previously advised the White House, became a vocal critic of the president's major tax and spending bill, labeling it fiscally irresponsible. In a series of posts on his social media platform X, Musk positioned the new party as an alternative to the two-party system, which he described as a 'uniparty' that is bankrupting the country. The announcement was met with skepticism from Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, who suggested Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics.</p>

          <p>Following England's 336-run defeat to India in the second Test at Edgbaston, coach Brendon McCullum has admitted they likely made a mistake at the coin toss. Captain Ben Stokes chose to bowl first, a tactic that has often worked, but it allowed India to bat on a favorable pitch and accumulate a massive first-innings score of 587. From that point, India controlled the match, securing a decisive victory on the final day. While Stokes pointed to the team's inability to dismiss India's lower-order batsmen, McCullum's rare admission of a tactical error marks a shift for the typically forward-looking England camp.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has initiated its largest-ever effort to draft ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) men into military service, starting to summon all 54,000 eligible individuals. This massive campaign aims to have them report for duty by July 2026, a significant increase from previous efforts. The move comes amid pressure from the High Court and the public to broaden the draft, especially given the high demands on soldiers during the current conflict. The IDF is demanding government sanctions against draft dodgers to enforce compliance, though it anticipates that widespread enlistment is unlikely without support from Haredi political and religious leaders.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in central Texas, which have claimed nearly 70 lives, are underscoring the severe limitations of forecasting extreme weather in a changing climate. An analysis of the event reveals that the rainfall's intensity, with over 10 inches in three hours, was an exceptionally rare occurrence, exceeding a 1-in-500-year probability. While the National Weather Service issued timely watches and warnings, the predicted rainfall amounts were about half of what ultimately fell. This disaster highlights the difficulty of pinpointing the exact location and magnitude of such historic downpours, a challenge exacerbated by climate warming and staffing shortages within federal agencies.</p>

Bessent stated that letters would be sent to notify countries that if a deal is not reached, they will 'boomerang back' to their April 2 tariff levels.

          <p>The Greek operator of the oil tanker Vilamoura has stated that an external explosive device was the likely cause of a blast that damaged the vessel off the coast of Libya last week. According to TMS Tankers, a preliminary investigation points to an unidentified explosive, possibly a limpet mine, as the source of the explosion that fractured the hull and flooded the engine room. The tanker, which was carrying a million barrels of oil, lost maneuverability but has since been safely towed to Greece. All crew members are reported to be in good health following the incident.</p>

          <p>A German journalists' association and Germany's ambassador to Israel have strongly condemned an attack on a Deutsche Welle (DW) news team by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. The DW correspondent and cameraman, who were wearing marked press jackets, were chased and had stones thrown at them while covering a protest; they escaped unharmed but their vehicle was badly damaged. DW's Director General called the attack unjustifiable and demanded that the Israeli government ensure the safety of all journalists and protect freedom of the press, which he called an indispensable pillar of any democracy.</p>

          <p>The dire state of Libya's healthcare system is forcing families to risk their lives on dangerous sea voyages to Europe for medical treatment. The story of Sohan Aboulsoud, a 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis whose family couldn't get her treatment in Libya, has gone viral after her mother shared a photo of her on a smuggler's boat to Italy. This case highlights a wider crisis, as the country's political instability since 2011 has led to a collapse in medical services, leaving many Libyans with no option but to seek help abroad through illicit and perilous means.</p>

          <p>Chinese military experts have publicly advocated for structural changes within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to more effectively counter the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles. Writing in the official PLA Daily, the experts noted the crucial role drones have played in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine and suggested establishing specialized counter-drone combat units. While this is seen as a long-term goal, the immediate focus is on integrating new capabilities into existing forces. For example, they propose upgrading electronic warfare units to become intelligent counter-drone teams capable of AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming.</p>

          <p>Renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has described the potential elimination of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as 'shortsighted' and 'foolhardy.' His comments come as the White House targets public media entities like PBS and NPR, claiming they spread propaganda. In a recent interview, Burns defended PBS, where all his films have aired, as a vital American institution that serves diverse communities, particularly in rural areas where it may be the only broadcast signal available. He argued that cutting its funding would be a great loss and that he could not produce his long-form documentaries without the support and time PBS provides.</p>

With the 90-day pause on tariffs expiring Wednesday, EU leaders are reportedly divided on strategy, with some, like Germany's chancellor, favoring a quick deal while others, like France's president, advocate for holding out for better terms. The uncertainty has caused significant disruption to the global economy, and European industries are bracing for new challenges regardless of whether a limited framework agreement can be reached in time.

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have announced the discovery of a 3,500-year-old ancient city named Peñico in the northern Barranca province. The city is believed to have been a strategic trading hub, connecting early coastal communities with civilizations in the Andes and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides crucial insight into the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, which declined due to climate change. The site contains 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential complexes, where artifacts like clay sculptures and seashell necklaces were found, enriching our understanding of early societies in the region.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that the international community's handling of the war in Gaza is causing a foundational collapse of the post-WWII global order. It posits that the consistent failure to hold Israel accountable for actions like bombing hospitals, using starvation as a weapon, and violating international law is dangerously shifting the line of what is considered acceptable in armed conflict. The piece connects this global trend to domestic issues in the West, such as the suppression of pro-Palestinian dissent on university campuses. It concludes that the hypocrisy shown towards the Palestinian situation is threatening the very system of international law.</p>
