          <p>The film “The Luckiest Man in America” recounts Michael Larson's exploit on the game show “Press Your Luck,” where he memorably won over $110,000 by memorizing the game's patterns.  The movie critiques the media's portrayal of Larson as “lucky,” highlighting the corporate narrative that obscures the skill involved and the producers' panic at his success.  It uses a blend of vintage aesthetics and modern filmmaking techniques to create a compelling and darkly comedic story of corporate deception and individual ingenuity.</p>
