        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, U.S. companies announced nearly 86,000 job cuts in August, a 39% increase from the previous month and the highest for that month since 2020. This marks the sixth instance this year where layoffs have surpassed the corresponding month in the prior year, signaling a potential slowdown in the labor market. The report cites economic and market factors as the primary drivers for the cuts, with the pharmaceutical and finance industries being the most affected. This data precedes the official government jobs report, which is expected to show modest job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially dropped a proposed rule that would have required airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, faced strong opposition from airlines who argued it would increase ticket prices and operational burdens. Airline industry groups praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from unnecessary regulation, while the department reviews other consumer protection rules, including those related to refunds and fee transparency.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by nearly 20% to their lowest point since its July initial public offering, following the release of its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. While second-quarter revenue of $249.6 million slightly exceeded analyst expectations, the company's third-quarter forecast, despite suggesting 33% growth, did not prevent the stock's significant drop. The decline marks a volatile period for the high-profile tech company, whose stock had surged over 250% on its first day of trading but has since lost more than half its value.

Although second-quarter sales and earnings surpassed estimates, the guidance for the upcoming quarter fell short of analyst projections. The company has not benefited from the AI boom to the same extent as its peers, and Wall Street remains concerned about the long-term impact of AI on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) industry. CEO Marc Benioff remains optimistic, dismissing concerns and highlighting strong customer deals for its AI products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is asking the state's highest court to reinstate the massive financial penalty against Donald Trump in his civil fraud case. This move follows a lower appellate court's decision to eliminate the fine, which had grown to over $500 million with interest, ruling it violated the U.S. Constitution's ban on excessive fines. While the financial penalty was wiped away, the lower court upheld the trial's finding that Trump committed fraud and left other punishments in place, which Trump's legal team is also appealing.</p>

          <p>In his new book, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of pain, drawing on his experience as a neurosurgeon to explain its causes and treatments. He emphasizes that the brain is the ultimate decider of pain and can sometimes make mistakes, such as in cases of phantom limb pain. Gupta highlights the power of the mind to manage pain through techniques like meditation and active gratitude, which can activate the body's natural endorphin system. The article also discusses a new non-opioid pain medication and the current scientific understanding of cannabis for pain relief.</p>

          <p>Following a speech by Rep. Rashida Tlaib where she described America's political structures as being built on oppression, an expert from the Heritage Foundation has raised concerns about what he calls a decline in assimilation. Simon Hankinson argues that lenient immigration policies have led to a rise in "ethno-politics" and that political leaders, in particular, should renounce all foreign allegiances. He contends that for some on the left, assimilation has become a "dirty word," leading to elected officials who seem to prioritize the interests of their ancestral cultures over their American constituents.</p>

          <p>A new bill introduced by Democrats, titled the "You Earn It, You Keep It Act," proposes to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost and bolster the program's finances, the legislation would also apply the Social Security payroll tax to all annual earnings above $250,000, removing the current income cap. Proponents, including The Senior Citizens League, argue this is a commonsense step to help seniors, and an analysis suggests the changes could extend the Social Security trust funds' solvency by 24 years.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, repeatedly refused to disclose the source of the "tip" that led him to accuse Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud. During a CNBC interview, Pulte stated it would be "reckless" to reveal his sources and methods, despite being pressed that doing so could address perceptions of political weaponization. He denied that his actions against Cook are politically motivated, framing them as routine, even as he has maintained a highly public social media campaign against both Cook and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that President Trump unlawfully imposed sweeping country-based tariffs could result in American businesses being owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The government has collected over $70 billion from these specific tariffs, but the ruling is currently being appealed to the Supreme Court. If the decision is upheld, the government would have to cease collecting the tariffs and could be forced to issue refunds, though the process for reimbursement remains uncertain. This legal battle adds another layer of complexity for businesses already struggling with pricing and supply chain disruptions.</p>

Orsted claims this justification is a pretext, arguing the order is arbitrary, unlawful, and motivated by President Trump's well-documented hostility towards wind power.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed two lawsuits against Southern California Edison, seeking more than $77 million in damages for the costs associated with two major wildfires.

The lawsuits aim to recover costs for fire suppression, rehabilitation, and other damages, with officials stating that ratepayers should not be held responsible for the financial burden.</p>

The Expedition's success, driven by its higher-end models, is outperforming Ford's overall sales growth and stands in contrast to the broader industry's heavy focus on the transition to electric vehicles, where Ford has taken a more measured approach.
