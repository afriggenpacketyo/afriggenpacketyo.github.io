          <p>A recent British survey indicates a significant number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with some even expressing a desire to live in a pre-internet era. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, caters to this desire by organizing in-person meetups where smartphones and laptops are prohibited, fostering genuine social interaction. These events, which have expanded to major European cities, involve activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts, aiming to reconnect people with themselves and others. Studies have linked excessive smartphone use to mental health issues, prompting political discussions about potential digital curfews and age limits for social media use, reflecting a growing awareness of the harmful effects of constant connectivity. </p>

          <p>Overnight Russian drone and missile attacks have resulted in multiple deaths and injuries across several regions of Ukraine, including Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, and Mykolaiv. These attacks follow a day after Kyiv experienced one of its heaviest assaults since the beginning of the Russian invasion. Russia's defense ministry claims to have intercepted a large number of Ukrainian drones over Russian territory, including Moscow, causing temporary airport closures. The ongoing conflict, initiated by Russia in February 2022, has led to Moscow controlling approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspaper front pages highlight potential shifts in government policy regarding child benefits and winter fuel payments for the elderly. The Observer reports that the government plans to scrap the two-child benefit cap, while the Sunday Telegraph indicates Nigel Farage intends to match this and restore full winter fuel payments. The Sunday Mirror and Daily Mail lead with a report that security services are investigating possible Kremlin involvement in arson attacks linked to properties associated with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The Sunday Times focuses on Sir Alan Bates' criticism of the government's handling of Post Office scandal compensation, accusing it of running a "quasi kangaroo court."</p>

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed it as a "watershed moment" and stated that it would end "30 years of fragmentation."

Despite Japan downgrading the threat of COVID-19, many hospitals still maintain strict visitation policies, such as limiting the number of visitors and requiring masks. Physicians argue there is no scientific evidence that these restrictions prevent the spread of infections and that they negatively impact patients' mental and emotional well-being. They advocate for abolishing or curbing these measures to allow patients to visit with loved ones, especially during their final days.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Work Stress in Dog Owners to Anxiety in Their Pets</h2>

          <p>A recent study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their pets, likely due to dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The study emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners avoiding work-related thoughts when at home to safeguard the well-being of their canine companions.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world’s fastest electromagnetic coilgun. This coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute, significantly outpacing traditional firearms and surpassing existing US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, which have been a limiting factor in previous electromagnetic weapons due to recharging lag times. By powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries, the Chinese team has achieved a higher firing rate.</p>

The Dodgers' bullpen, already strained from a previous extra-inning game, limited manager Dave Roberts' options.

Connolly's case has also raised concerns about increasing police scrutiny of online activity and the limits of free expression.

          <p>The Japanese government is planning to improve the working conditions and increase the salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to attract more talent, due to the growing global popularity of Japanese cuisine. The annual salary for these chefs will increase to over 6 million yen, up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen. The new scheme, starting in January, will also allow chefs to opt for government-covered rented accommodation instead of living at the diplomatic establishments. The government hopes this will enable the chefs to promote Japanese food more proactively as 'food diplomats'.</p>
