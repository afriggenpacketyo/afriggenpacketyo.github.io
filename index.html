          <p>China is heavily investing in artificial intelligence, anticipating it will add trillions of yuan to its economy by 2035 through a national computing network and unified data market. Ten provinces and municipalities have joined a platform to match business demand with computing resources, attracting over 100 service providers and 1,000 industry users. The country's smart computing power is projected to grow significantly, with a compound annual rate of 46.2% expected from 2023 to 2028, underscoring a strategic push for technological self-reliance.</p>

          <p>France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris, Charles Kushner, after he sent a letter to President Macron criticizing France's efforts against antisemitism and its stance on a Palestinian state. The French foreign ministry deemed Kushner's allegations “unacceptable” and an interference in internal affairs, while the White House defended the ambassador's comments. This diplomatic incident follows Macron's earlier rejection of similar accusations from Israel's Prime Minister and highlights ongoing tensions in French-U.S. relations.</p>

Collaborative projects are crucial for addressing the environmental challenges that impact wider East Asia, as seen in China's worst sandstorm in a decade in 2021.</p>

          <p>Several major brands, including American Eagle, Swatch, and Colgate-Palmolive, have recently faced significant consumer backlash for their advertising campaigns, ranging from perceived cultural appropriation to offensive gestures. Experts suggest these blunders stem from "empathy failures" and an outdated approach to navigating cultural complexities. While some controversies can generate publicity and sales, companies are increasingly scrutinized by a divided public, making it challenging to craft universally resonant messages and genuinely connect with consumers.</p>

          <p>Scotland's A9, the nation's longest road, has been the site of 48 fatalities in the last decade, with a recent tragedy claiming an American family. The road's design, alternating between single and dual carriageways, contributes to dangerous overtaking and junctions. Despite a 2007 commitment to dual the entire Inverness-Perth stretch, the project's completion has been delayed by a decade to 2035, leaving many sections hazardous. Victims' families share their enduring grief, urging faster action on road safety improvements.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is urging energy firms to prepare for fracking, proposing to lift the ban on shale gas extraction if they come to power, despite previous political and environmental challenges. Deputy leader Richard Tice views the underground shale gas as a "treasure" and financially negligent to leave untapped. The party plans independent monitoring and testing to confirm viability and safety, aiming to know within two years if it's worthwhile. This stance contrasts sharply with Labour's focus on renewable energy and a permanent fracking ban.</p>
