            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed concerns regarding his use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations, specifically an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, in a chat that included his wife and brother. Hegseth dismissed these concerns as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees and affirmed his continued alignment with President Trump, who defended Hegseth and expressed confidence in his leadership. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended Hegseth, attributing the controversy to former employees and emphasizing the administration's stance against leaks of sensitive information. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is currently reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions, but Trump has publicly stated he has great confidence in Hegseth.

            <p>Catholics worldwide are mourning the death of Pope Francis, which occurred on Easter Monday, shortly after he delivered his Easter Sunday address. From the Vatican to the Philippines and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Catholics are reflecting on his legacy and influence, particularly his emphasis on the dignity of every human being and his outreach to marginalized communities. Church bells tolled in Manila, where a large Catholic population gathered to pray, while in the Vatican, mourners expressed shock at his passing so soon after his Easter appearance. His final address called for an end to violence in the DRC, where he had visited the previous year.</p>

            <p>The annual White House Easter Egg Roll, hosted by President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, took place on Monday, coinciding with mourning for Pope Francis. This year's event was notable for its corporate sponsorships, with companies like Amazon, YouTube, and Meta sponsoring various stations. Unlike past years where the American Egg Board was the primary sponsor, corporations paid for sponsorships that included branded activations and access to exclusive events with the First Lady. The event's theme looked ahead to the nation's 250th anniversary, offering children the chance to sign mini Declarations of Independence.</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days, despite claiming his citizenship. Border patrol officials initially claimed Hermosillo admitted to entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico, but later, his family provided his birth certificate and social security card, leading to his release. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that the arrest was due to Hermosillo's own statements. The incident highlights concerns about wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens by immigration officials, a problem that has occurred across multiple administrations.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned against trade agreements that undermine its economic interests, as the Trump administration negotiates trade deals with other nations. The Chinese commerce ministry stated that while it respects other countries' efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S., it will implement countermeasures if any deals compromise China's interests. This warning comes amid reports that the Trump administration intends to isolate China through tariff negotiations. China emphasized that seeking tariff exemptions at the expense of others will ultimately harm all parties involved.</p>

            <p>President Trump has escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and asserting that the U.S. economy could decelerate unless interest rates are immediately lowered. Trump argued that low inflation justifies preemptive rate cuts. Experts suggest that any attempt to fire Powell would likely destabilize U.S. equity markets, increasing yields and weakening the dollar. Powell has previously stated that the president does not have the legal authority to remove him.</p>

Using national average electricity and gas prices, the analysis demonstrates that driving a Tesla Model S, 3, X, or Y 100 miles per day is substantially cheaper than driving a Camry the same distance. The calculations, based on Tesla's charging calculator, indicate monthly savings ranging from $209 to $247 depending on the Tesla model. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative aims to make the life-saving overdose reversal medication more affordable and accessible. The state has already saved $17 million since May 2024 by purchasing naloxone at a reduced price through CalRx. Preliminary data suggests a decrease in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in California, possibly due to comprehensive efforts including wider naloxone distribution.</p>

            <p>Doug Sosnik, a former senior advisor to Bill Clinton, issued a critical analysis of President Trump's initial 100 days in office, suggesting he has "overread his mandate" and is at risk of a "historically unpopular presidency." Sosnik argues that Trump has fallen into the trap of confusing campaigning with effective governance, pointing to the chaotic rollout of immigration and tariff policies. He also notes that Trump's approval ratings are already declining, and that his policies are creating uncertainty for businesses. Sosnik concludes that Trump's chaotic style of governing has made it impossible for companies to make investment decisions.</p>

            <p>Chinese enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, driven by concerns about the safety and credibility of U.S. assets. A survey by Renmin University's International Monetary Institute indicates a growing percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements. Economists attribute this trend to the weakening dominance of the U.S. dollar and policies from the new U.S. administration. The recent volatility in the U.S. Treasury market has further fueled this shift, with global capital not flowing to the U.S. as it has in the past.</p>

            <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, the Catholic Church initiates a series of rituals and traditions, beginning with the formal pronouncement of death by the Cardinal Camerlengo. A nine-day mourning period, called Novemdiales, follows, during which cardinals gather in Rome. Between 15 and 20 days after the Pope's death, the Cardinal Electors will convene in a conclave to elect the next pontiff, casting ballots in the Sistine Chapel until a candidate secures a two-thirds-plus-one majority.</p>

Six survivors will return for the commemoration, including a 100-year-old Ukrainian man.

            <p>A New Hampshire federal judge is considering whether to block the Trump administration from enforcing a letter that aims to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in public schools. A group of organizations has sued the U.S. Department of Education, arguing that the letter threatens financial repercussions for schools that maintain DEI programs. The government contends that the letter simply warns schools against violating Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin. The case raises questions about the scope of the federal government's authority over public schools and the role of DEI in education.</p>

            <p>Pope Francis, during his 12-year papacy, steered the Catholic Church into uncharted territory, softening its image and intervening in major social issues. He was a vocal critic of powerful nations and championed the cause of the poor. He worked to build bridges with other Christian denominations, other religions and those of no faith. The pontiff also introduced rules that meant members of the Church had a responsibility to report on abuse if they had knowledge of it, otherwise they risked being removed from their positions. He introduced new rules on financial transparency.</p>
