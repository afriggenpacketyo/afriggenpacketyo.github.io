          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the Trump administration's efforts to deploy National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon. This ruling came after the same judge previously blocked the deployment of Oregon's own Guard, with the White House then attempting to circumvent the order by mobilizing external forces. The judge questioned the administration's actions, emphasizing that conditions in Oregon did not warrant military intervention and that such deployments could undermine state sovereignty. This ongoing legal battle highlights a significant dispute over presidential authority in domestic operations.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has weakened to a tropical storm as it moves off Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing high surf and gusty winds to Baja California Sur. The storm, now with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, is forecast to continue weakening over the next 48 hours while remaining offshore. A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of Baja California Sur. Forecasters warn that large swells generated by Priscilla are likely to cause life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued a rebuttal to an op-ed by six former surgeons general, who accused current Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of endangering the nation's health. The former officials cited Kennedy's promotion of false claims about vaccines and his overhaul of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. An HHS spokesperson countered that these critics presided over a decline in public health, while Kennedy is actively addressing these issues. This public dispute highlights deep divisions over public health policy and vaccine information.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service announced it will furlough approximately 34,000 employees, nearly half its workforce, due to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision will significantly impede taxpayers' ability to receive assistance, with increased wait times and backlogs expected. The National Treasury Employees Union condemned the move, highlighting the disruption to vital public services. This action comes amidst uncertainty regarding back pay for furloughed workers, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure automatic payment after shutdowns.</p>

          <p>Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa's convoy was attacked by protesters in a rural town, with his government labeling the incident an assassination attempt and claiming shots were fired. The attack occurred amidst escalating political tensions and indigenous-led protests against Noboa's austerity measures, including the cessation of fuel subsidies. While five individuals were detained, the national Indigenous federation, CONAIE, blamed the government for the violence. The UN Secretary-General has condemned the violence and called for peaceful dialogue to resolve the ongoing unrest in the country.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned that a shortage of air traffic controllers is contributing to increased U.S. flight delays, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Thousands of flights have been delayed, with the FAA slowing or halting arrivals at some airports due to staffing issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted a "slight uptick" in sick calls among controllers, many of whom are working long shifts without pay. The air traffic controllers' union highlighted their dedication despite the financial strain, urging Congress to resolve the funding impasse.</p>

          <p>Google is tightening its "Work from Anywhere" (WFA) policy, which allowed employees to work remotely for up to four weeks annually since the Covid pandemic. Under the new rules, even a single day of WFA will now count as a full week deducted from an employee's annual balance. This change, which does not affect the standard hybrid schedule, also prohibits using WFA weeks to work from home or a local Google office in a different state or country. Violations of the updated policy could lead to disciplinary action or termination, reflecting a broader tech industry trend towards increased in-office presence.</p>

          <p>California is challenging President Trump's deployment of its National Guard troops to Illinois, arguing the White House used claims of unrest in Los Angeles as a pretext for a broader, nationwide expansion of federal control. The state filed a motion asking the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to end federal control, citing the Guard's deployment for missions beyond original limits, including drug raids and out-of-state assignments. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's actions as an "illegal charade" and an abuse of power, intensifying the legal battle over state military forces.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate once again rejected both Republican and Democratic funding proposals, ensuring the government shutdown continues into its second week with no resolution in sight. Dueling stopgap bills, one backed by the GOP and another by Democrats, failed to advance in separate votes. Both parties blame each other for the impasse, with Republicans pushing for short-term funding and Democrats advocating for additional healthcare funding.

Both products feature variable rates that may decrease with future Fed rate cuts, but the HELOC's lower starting point offers more material savings.
