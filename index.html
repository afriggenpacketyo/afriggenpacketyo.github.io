        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has rectified a significant data error concerning international student enrollment. Corrected figures reveal a 6.5% year-over-year increase, contradicting a previous, erroneous report that had indicated a sharp decline of over 200,000 students. This revised data, prompted by an external analysis, aligns with other findings showing robust growth in the number of students from abroad. The correction provides a more accurate understanding of international education trends in the U.S. during a period of intense scrutiny.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Adobe Analytics, the first 24 hours of Amazon's Prime Day sales event generated $7.9 billion in U.S. online sales, a 9.9% increase from the previous year. This figure established a new record for the single biggest e-commerce day of the year so far, surpassing even last year's Thanksgiving sales. The event has prompted competing sales from other major retailers like Walmart and Target. Analysts expect the full 96-hour event to generate nearly $24 billion, though it occurs amidst consumer concerns about the economy and potential price impacts from tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose significant new tariffs on up to 20 countries, with some rates reaching as high as 40%, effective August 1. Initial letters targeted major trading partners like Japan and South Korea with 25% duties, while subsequent announcements included nations such as Myanmar, Libya, and the Philippines. The White House has framed the move as a way to create reciprocal trade relationships. Economists, however, warn that such broad tariffs could trigger another wave of inflation and disrupt global financial markets by increasing trading costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To combat declining same-store sales and attract inflation-weary customers, McDonald's is refreshing its menu by bringing back the popular Snack Wrap and introducing a limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin. The fast-food giant has seen a drop in traffic from low-income consumers and is leaning into value offerings, like its $5 meal deal, to regain market trust. The return of the Snack Wrap after a nine-year hiatus follows a significant fan campaign, and the company is also promoting more affordable chicken options as beef prices have risen to record highs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's public pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and his consideration of appointing a "shadow chair" have raised concerns about the central bank's future independence. Analysts worry that any new Fed chair appointed under these circumstances will face a credibility problem, with markets suspecting they were chosen to execute political demands rather than make data-driven decisions. This potential politicization of monetary policy could undermine the Fed's dual mandate of promoting stable inflation and full employment, creating significant uncertainty for financial markets.

          <p>Sitting around a campfire may provide tangible mental health benefits, according to psychologists and scientific research. Studies have indicated that exposure to a crackling fire can lead to significant reductions in blood pressure. Experts suggest that the experience is therapeutic because it provides a disarming, non-threatening environment that encourages social engagement away from digital distractions. The natural setting helps brains rest and restore, counteracting the fatigue of modern life and potentially reducing symptoms of both depression and anxiety by fostering connection and relaxation.</p>

          <p>Colorado State University researchers have updated their forecast for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting above-average activity with 16 named storms and eight hurricanes. Three of these are expected to become major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. While this forecast is slightly less intense than the 2024 prediction, it still suggests activity will be about 125% higher than the long-term average. The primary drivers for the active season are warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures and the anticipated absence of a strong El Niño weather pattern, which typically suppresses hurricane formation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins suggested that forcing able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, combined with increased automation, could fill labor gaps created by mass deportations of migrant farm workers. The proposal comes after President Trump mandated work requirements for Medicaid, a healthcare program for low-income individuals. However, agricultural experts and economists have expressed strong skepticism, pointing to historical evidence from states like Georgia and Alabama where similar policies led to severe labor shortages and economic losses, as American-born workers were unwilling to perform the demanding farm labor.</p>

          <p>Following the recent war between Iran and Israel, speculation has intensified regarding the potential successor to Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Potential candidates range from hardliners like Khamenei's son to more moderate figures. Experts note that the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may seek to influence the choice, potentially even backing a non-clerical leader to steer the country away from its current path of economic hardship and international isolation.</p>

The piece notes that ads seeking bulldozer drivers for this work have appeared on social media, a practice legal scholars suggest could be viewed as aiding war crimes.

          <p>President Trump's invitation to five West and Central African leaders to the White House signals a strategic shift in U.S. policy toward the continent, focusing on migration, security, and resource competition with China and Russia. Analysts suggest the administration is moving away from development aid toward a more transactional, "America First" approach centered on trade and strategic interests. Discussions are expected to cover cooperation on tackling Islamist insurgencies, curbing migration routes, and potentially securing U.S. access to critical minerals like manganese, gold, and oil in the region.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland have confirmed they are making preparations for a potential visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire later this month. The visit is expected for the opening of a new course at the resort. While no official confirmation has been released, authorities are planning for what would be a significant policing operation. Trump's last presidential visit in 2018 prompted major security measures and large-scale protests, and his controversial resort has faced criticism from environmental groups and local politicians.</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health plans to offer generic semaglutide, the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in Canada. The move comes as Novo Nordisk's patent on the drug is set to expire there in January after the company failed to pay maintenance fees. This development opens the Canadian market to generic competition, potentially making the popular but expensive GLP-1 medications more affordable and accessible. Hims & Hers joins other drugmakers looking to enter the market, which is projected to grow to over $4 billion by 2035.</p>

The Neptune missile is a key domestically produced weapon that Ukraine successfully used to sink the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet in 2022.</p>

While some of this anxiety is a generational trope, national test score data does show a real decline in reading proficiency among younger students over the last decade, a trend that predates the pandemic. Experts are divided on the causes, citing factors from screen time and teaching methods to the end of the No Child Left Behind Act.

Emergency crews rescued more than 50 other people from the floodwaters.
