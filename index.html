          <p>Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander acknowledged widespread despondency among Labour MPs after a week of significant political upheaval. Lord Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador due to links with Jeffrey Epstein, a decision criticized for its delay and vetting process. This followed Deputy PM Angela Rayner's resignation over tax affairs, further compounding difficulties for Sir Keir Starmer's government. The events have sparked internal anger and calls for greater accountability regarding senior appointments.</p>

          <p>Tons of hazardous waste, including fiberglass and car batteries, were illegally dumped in Jirikov, Czech Republic, by a German company. Mayor Barbora Siskova prevented further dumping and initiated an investigation, revealing other sites and leading to arrests. With the responsible German company now insolvent, Bavaria is funding the cleanup, which is underway, but environmental damage from toxins like PFAS is still being assessed. This highlights a broader European issue of illegal cross-border waste trafficking, often driven by high profits and lax enforcement.</p>

Baroness Lawrence views this as the "last opportunity" for full justice, as only two of six suspects have been convicted, emphasizing her inability to grieve until the case is fully resolved.</p>

          <p>The UK House of Lords is commencing a two-day debate on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which proposes allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales with less than six months to live to apply for assisted death. Supporters urge peers to respect the Commons' backing, while opponents raise concerns about safeguards, coercion, and the bill's lack of detailed provisions. Despite a committee warning about insufficient scrutiny, the bill is expected to have enough parliamentary time to clear all stages, though significant amendments are anticipated.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: US Industrial Policy and China Containment Harmful to Global Trade</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 23:35:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Washington's industrial policy and efforts to contain China are counterproductive, potentially harming the US, its allies, and global trade. The article uses the recent US immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG plant in Georgia, where South Korean technicians were detained, as an example of policy contradictions. It suggests that such actions, driven by anti-immigrant sentiment and a push to reshore manufacturing, expose the futility of these policies and create distrust, particularly with key partners like South Korea.</p>

          <p>Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University, prompting a massive manhunt. Investigators have released photos and video of a "person of interest" and recovered a high-powered rifle, with Utah's governor vowing to pursue the death penalty. The shooting, which occurred during Kirk's "American Comeback" tour, has sparked shock and anger across the political spectrum, with President Trump and allies attributing it to "radical left political violence," while others warn against escalating tensions amid a rise in politically motivated attacks in the US.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a warning to Mexico, urging caution and threatening countermeasures if Mexico proceeds with plans to raise tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%. Mexico's proposed tariff hike, part of a broader budget proposal, aims to affect $52 billion worth of imports, particularly from China. Beijing argues that such actions, especially amidst US tariff abuses, should not sacrifice third-party interests and could negatively impact bilateral economic cooperation. China has previously used export restrictions on critical minerals as a retaliatory measure in trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Assembly Passes Bill to Increase Housing Density Near Transit Stops</h2>

          <p>The California Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and increase housing density near public transit hubs. The bill, which allows for buildings up to nine stories near certain transit stops, aims to address California's severe housing shortage. Despite support from labor groups and the bill's author, Senator Scott Wiener, it faces strong opposition from local authorities and residents concerned about altering single-family communities and stripping local control. The bill now awaits a final Senate vote and the Governor's signature.</p>
