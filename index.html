          <p>The Federal Reserve is contemplating relaxing a key capital rule, the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, for large Wall Street banks, a move intended to boost their operational capabilities. This rule, established post-financial crisis, dictates the amount and quality of capital banks must maintain. While proponents like Fed Chair Jerome Powell argue this adjustment is necessary due to the increase in safe assets on bank balance sheets, others, such as Governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr, express concerns that it could compromise crucial safeguards and lead to capital distribution to shareholders rather than increased Treasury intermediation. The proposal is open for public comment, highlighting the ongoing debate within the Fed regarding financial stability and regulatory effectiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BP's stock experienced volatility following reports of a potential acquisition by Shell, which Shell has since denied. The initial report caused BP's shares to jump significantly, driven by speculation that this could be the largest deal in the oil industry since the 1990s. However, Shell's denial led to a retraction in BP's gains, although the shares remained slightly elevated. This situation underscores the ongoing speculation surrounding BP's future, particularly as it has struggled to define its direction in recent years, especially after facing scrutiny for its pivot towards renewable energy investments. </p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling with the detention of his wife, Paola, by ICE, leaving him to care for their two young children, including a breastfeeding infant. Paola, a Mexican national who entered the U.S. as a minor, was detained during a green card application appointment due to a prior deportation order her mother received in 2018. Despite the family's efforts to comply with legal processes, Paola's detention highlights the strict enforcement policies of the current administration, which have reduced discretion previously afforded to military families. The situation has drawn criticism from migrant advocacy groups and raised concerns about the impact on military families facing similar circumstances.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has introduced the "No Adversarial AI Act" to ban federal use of artificial intelligence tools developed in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.

This move underscores the escalating tech rivalry between the U.S. and China, particularly in the realm of AI, where both countries are vying for global leadership.

The IAEA has faced criticism for its perceived failure to hold Iran accountable for its nuclear activities, with some experts suggesting the agency prioritizes diplomacy over enforcement.

Online banks tend to offer higher interest rates due to lower maintenance costs, with rates currently exceeding 4%. However, with anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, savers considering this option should act proactively to secure high rates before they decrease. While a 2-year CD offers higher returns, a 1-year CD provides a shorter commitment with still significant earnings, providing a balance between accessibility and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The preliminary assessment, which stated that the strikes likely set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months, contrasts with Trump's and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's earlier claims of total destruction. The disagreement highlights conflicting accounts and differing perspectives on the effectiveness of the U.S. military action.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, secured a legal victory in a copyright case, with a judge ruling that its use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, constitutes fair use. The court determined that Anthropic's language learning models (LLMs) transformed the copyrighted works to create something different, aligning with fair use doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial for downloading millions of pirated books, as court documents revealed internal concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The ruling sets a precedent for similar disputes involving AI companies and copyrighted material.</p>
