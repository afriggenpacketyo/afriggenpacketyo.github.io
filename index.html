        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of French nuclear weapons elsewhere in Europe, emphasizing that this would not compromise France's own defense capabilities. Macron noted the existing presence of U.S. nuclear-armed aircraft in Europe and stated France's readiness to engage in discussions. He clarified that any expansion would be conditional, with France maintaining ultimate control over the weapons and its defense remaining intact. Several European leaders, including Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, have shown interest in exploring such a possibility, driven by concerns over the U.S.'s nuclear commitment to Europe amidst Russian threats.</p>

          <p>A House committee session considering Medicaid cuts and other key parts of President Trumpâ€™s domestic agenda was disrupted by protesters, leading to arrests and a raucous start to what was expected to be a lengthy debate. Representative Brett Guthrie called for respectful debate, but protesters shouted against the proposed Medicaid cuts, accusing lawmakers of harming vulnerable people. Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee attempted to extend tax credits for Obamacare marketplaces, arguing against tax cuts for billionaires while denying relief for working families' healthcare. The committee meeting devolved into shouting matches, including disputes over the use of the word 'lying' in remarks, as Democrats highlighted the potential impact of the cuts on constituents, while Republicans accused them of misrepresenting the scope of the changes.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole. A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence after hearing emotional statements from the brothers, who apologized for their actions and discussed their rehabilitation efforts in prison. The brothers expressed remorse for the killings and spoke about their hopes to work with sexual abuse victims and assist those incarcerated if released. The district attorney's office opposed the resentencing, but the judge cited the brothers' 'remarkable' work in prison as a factor in the decision.</p>

This acknowledgment of a looming hunger crisis contrasts with Israel's previous claims that the blockade did not pose a major threat to civilian life.

          <p>Mali's military government has dissolved all political parties in the country, announcing the decision on television. The decree, signed by military government president Assimi Goita, prohibits members of dissolved parties from holding meetings. The move follows increasing reports of pro-democracy activists being kidnapped and comes after pro-democracy protests were held in Bamako. Mali has been under military rule since 2020, and elections have been delayed, raising concerns about the junta's commitment to transitioning back to civilian rule.</p>

          <p>Aides to former U.S. President Joe Biden have refuted claims in a new book alleging a cover-up of his 'physical deterioration' during his re-election campaign. The book, 'Original Sin', suggests Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed using a wheelchair. A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president, stating that 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.' The book cites anonymous sources and claims that aides sought to accommodate Biden's declining physical condition by shortening walking distances and ensuring the use of handrails.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. This change in policy means permanent bans will expire upon death, allowing for consideration of their Hall of Fame candidacies. Rose, who holds the record for career hits, was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The decision has sparked debate among baseball fans and historians, given the accomplishments and controversies associated with these players.</p>
