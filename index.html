          <p>President Trump's recent declaration that Ukraine is in a position to win back all of its territory has triggered a rally in global defense stocks. This marks a significant rhetorical shift from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to make territorial concessions for peace. The market's positive reaction was immediate, with European and Asian defense firms like Saab, Leonardo, and Hanwha Aerospace seeing notable increases in their share prices, reflecting investor anticipation of continued military support for Ukraine.</p>

Speaking with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Li urged for a "healthy, stable and sustainable" partnership and called on Ottawa to adopt a "correct" perception of China. The discussion occurs amidst ongoing diplomatic and trade friction, which has included Canadian tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and retaliatory Chinese taxes on Canadian canola imports.</p>

          <p>An ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and online shows, often termed the "manosphere," appears to be showing waning enthusiasm for President Donald Trump's second term. While some hosts remain staunchly loyal, influential figures like Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz have grown more critical of the administration's policies and perceived lack of transparency. This fragmentation among key media allies could present a challenge for the Trump coalition, which has relied on these platforms to engage with young, male voters.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show with an impassioned monologue on free speech after a suspension, a reinstatement driven largely by a vocal campaign from celebrities, influencers, and grassroots supporters. This event showcased a new model of celebrity-led resistance that successfully pressured a major corporation, Disney, to reverse its course. However, the victory remains incomplete, as major broadcast groups Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing to preempt the show in their markets, demonstrating the practical limits of such an opposition movement.</p>

          <p>New York Mets announcers Gary Cohen and Todd Zeile have been criticized for their on-air comments about Chicago Cubs player Matt Shaw missing a game to attend Charlie Kirk's funeral. Cohen called the decision "weird," while Zeile described it as "unprecedented," sparking backlash on social media. Shaw defended his choice, explaining his friendship with the late conservative activist was based on their shared Christian faith and that he felt it was important to be there despite his team's schedule.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised what he called a "big shift" in U.S. President Donald Trump's position on the war with Russia. Following a meeting at the UN, Trump posted on social media that Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form." This represents a dramatic pivot from Trump's previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede territory for a peace deal, and was met with cautious optimism in Ukraine as a potentially significant change in U.S. rhetoric.</p>

Sanders asserts that the concentration of so much wealth and power in the hands of a few is creating an oligarchy, and calls for a collective movement to build an economy that works for everyone.</p>

          <p>On its 80th anniversary, the United Nations is facing profound questions about its purpose and effectiveness in a world beset by crises. The Security Council's ability to act is often crippled by the veto power of its permanent members, leading to deadlock on critical issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Coupled with financial difficulties and criticism that its structure is outdated and unrepresentative of the modern world, the UN is struggling to maintain its credibility as a force for global peace and stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the rich history of spices and the word "spicy," which extends far beyond modern seasonal beverages. For millennia, spices like cinnamon, pepper, and cloves were highly prized exotic commodities that drove global exploration, conflict, and commerce, often serving as symbols of immense wealth and status. The term "spicy" itself evolved around the 19th century to also describe things that are provocative or racy, reflecting the sharp, engaging, and desirable nature of the spices themselves.</p>

          <p>A ballot proposal in New York City could move its local elections to even-numbered years, aligning them with midterm and presidential contests. This initiative is part of a growing national trend aimed at addressing the persistently low voter turnout that plagues "off-cycle" municipal elections. Proponents argue that consolidating election dates increases participation, particularly among younger voters and minorities, and saves administrative costs, though some raise concerns that local issues might get lost in the national political shuffle.</p>
