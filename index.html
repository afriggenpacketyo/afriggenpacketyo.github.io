          <p>Three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies were killed when a grenade, believed to be inert, detonated at a training facility. The device was one of two recovered from a Santa Monica garage the previous day. Authorities have now confirmed the second grenade is missing, prompting an extensive search and a public safety warning not to touch any explosive devices. The sheriff's department has revised its protocols, vowing to treat all future recovered explosives as live and has temporarily suspended its bomb squad's operations.</p>

          <p>The UN's World Food Programme has issued a stark warning about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating that almost one-third of the population is experiencing days without eating. Malnutrition is reportedly surging, with 90,000 women and children requiring urgent treatment, and the death toll from malnutrition has surpassed 120. Amid mounting international pressure, Israel has indicated it may allow aid airdrops, a move some aid agencies and the UN criticize as inefficient. The crisis has prompted joint calls from Germany, France, and the UK for Israel to lift restrictions on aid.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. The project, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to become operational after 2030. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also developing advanced reactors. The goal is to create a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone in the country's energy strategy.</p>

          <p>A double-decker bus traveling from Lima, Peru, veered off the road and fell into a ravine, killing at least 15 people and injuring approximately 30 others. The bus, which was carrying over 60 passengers, crashed in the Palca district and landed on its roof near a river. Authorities are currently in the process of identifying the deceased and investigating the cause of the accident. According to official reports, reckless driving and excessive speed are the primary causes of such accidents in Peru, where fatal bus crashes are unfortunately a recurring issue.</p>

          <p>The British government has strongly condemned Hong Kong's latest offer of cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of 19 pro-democracy activists, many of whom reside in the UK. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the move an act of "transnational repression." The bounties, which range up to $125,000, target individuals accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This action has heightened diplomatic tensions, with the UK reaffirming its commitment to protecting the rights and safety of Hong Kong residents who have relocated to Britain.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Iowa, Noah Johnson, experienced a severe medical crisis after being bitten by a spider at his summer job. The seemingly simple bite led to a serious infection, a 103-degree fever, and ultimately, kidney failure. He was rushed into emergency surgery, placed on dialysis, and spent two weeks in the ICU, at times unable to speak. After a harrowing few weeks, his kidneys began to function again, and he is now recovering at home, supported by his family and community fundraising efforts.</p>

          <p>Scientists are pioneering a new method for hurricane forecasting by equipping sharks with sensors to gather crucial ocean data. Led by the University of Delaware, the project aims to use sharks as mobile data collectors, measuring water temperature and conductivity in areas often inaccessible to traditional equipment. Since warm ocean temperatures fuel hurricanes, this data could enhance prediction models for storm intensity and trajectory. While still in early stages, the research hopes to eventually tag dozens of sharks annually, turning these apex predators into valuable, swimming ocean sensors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a significant increase in the populations of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. According to the Royal Horticultural Society, the warm weather caused a boom in aphids, which are a primary food source for ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation also reported an extraordinary year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers seen in 2024. However, experts caution that the relative lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that the city's limits on cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents illegally thwarted federal law enforcement. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that Chicago's policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not unlawfully interfere with federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the ruling, affirming the city's right to focus its law enforcement resources on local needs rather than federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were ostracized for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It explores the widespread impact of the anti-Communist fervor, which compelled many to name names to save their careers and extended beyond Hollywood to affect teachers and union members, raising enduring questions about free speech and democracy.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity for her two-day interview with the Department of Justice. This "proffer immunity" allowed her to answer questions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche without her statements being used against her later, a common practice when prosecutors seek cooperation. Maxwell's attorney confirmed she answered all questions but stated no promises were made in return. The development comes as the DOJ faces pressure to provide more transparency on the Jeffrey Epstein case and questions swirl about high-profile individuals connected to him.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are undertaking a significant effort to save the bighorn sheep population in Texas, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. Wildlife biologists from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd. These animals, including pregnant ewes, were relocated over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy population. Recent observations have confirmed the presence of newborn lambs, indicating the monumental rescue mission is showing early signs of success.</p>

Experts weigh in, suggesting that while these targets provide useful guidance, strict adherence isn't always necessary for a healthy life. For instance, one kidney specialist argues that thirst is a reliable guide for hydration for most people. The consensus among the experts is that it is better to incorporate a generally healthy outlook into daily life rather than fixating on achieving specific, rigid numerical goals.</p>
