        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, some up to Â£1,000, and potential debt write-offs due to the scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies will disburse over Â£70 million in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator, which found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent after they fell behind on bills. The payouts will range from Â£40 to Â£500 based on the supplier's handling of the situation, with Â£1,000 payments for inappropriate installations; customers do not need to take any action as compensation will be directly deposited into their accounts. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for involuntary prepayment meter installations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is causing concern about capital flight from the U.S. and a potential carry trade unwind as long-dated yields approach record highs. Demand for 40-year government bonds has dropped, pushing yields higher, which could lead Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S. Albert Edwards from Societe Generale warns that this could trigger a global financial market crisis, particularly impacting U.S. tech stocks. While some analysts believe the carry trade impact may be less severe than in the past due to a depreciating dollar, others warn of a progressive erosion of confidence in the U.S. dollar and a gradual decline in the carry trade.

Ofwat has ordered Thames Water to halt further dividend payments without regulatory approval, reflecting the company's ongoing struggles with sewage discharges, leaks, and a Â£20 billion debt. While Thames Water secured an emergency Â£3 billion in March to avoid collapse, the government remains on standby to potentially place the company into special administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to temporarily halt scheduling student visa appointments as it prepares to expand social media vetting for applicants. A memo sent to diplomatic posts indicates the pause will last until further guidance is issued regarding the stepped-up social media screening for student and foreign exchange visas. The state department says it takes the vetting process seriously and will continue to use every tool to assess who enters the country. This action comes amid Trump's ongoing disputes with elite colleges, which he accuses of enabling antisemitism and upholding discriminatory admissions policies.</p>

Gaethje, known for his exciting fighting style, is also a popular choice, while Pimblett dismisses a potential match with Arman Tsarukyan due to lack of fan interest.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space during its latest flight but failed to complete its return to Earth due to a propellant leak that caused it to spin out of control. The spacecraft broke up during re-entry into the atmosphere, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean, suggesting that further work is needed on the upper-stage vehicle. While the company appears to have resolved ascent issues from previous flights, the loss of control prevented the collection of crucial data on heat shield performance.

          <p>Getty Images is investing millions in its lawsuit against Stability AI, alleging that the AI company is unlawfully using copyrighted material to train its AI models for commercial gain. Getty CEO Craig Peters argues that Stability AI and other AI labs are essentially stealing copyrighted images to develop their AI models and then using those models to compete in existing commercial markets. Peters contends that this is unfair competition and theft, as it undermines the rights of content creators. Stability AI has contested the legal action, arguing that Getty's claims lack merit.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Metropolitan Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's proposals for early prisoner release. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they argued that the plans could negatively impact public safety, citing concerns about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail time. The letter urged against early releases for high-risk offenders, terrorists, and those jailed under national security legislation. The government maintains that the announced proposals have addressed many of these concerns, including continued short sentences for repeat offenders and the ineligibility of terrorists for early release.</p>

A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of businesses reported worsening operating conditions. The proportion of companies planning to expand their operations in China has also declined to a record low. Despite these challenges, some European companies are increasing their reliance on Chinese components, making their supply chains more dependent on China amid trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly' during its ninth flight test, despite successfully reaching orbit. An apparent propellant leak after entering its suborbital trajectory led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and re-enter Earth's atmosphere at an unfavorable angle. Most of the spacecraft is expected to have burned up during re-entry, with the remaining pieces falling into the Indian Ocean. The company will analyze the data from the flight to improve Starship's reliability for future missions aimed at making life multiplanetary.</p>
