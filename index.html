            <p>Amanda Knox, who spent nearly four years in an Italian prison, recounts in her new book how a Catholic priest became her best friend and a source of hope during her incarceration. Knox, an atheist, says prison chaplain Don Saulo provided philosophical engagement and helped her find value in her experience, shifting her perspective from despair to hope. She also described how Saulo taught her to play guitar and piano, and taught her Latin phrases. Knox dedicates her book to Saulo, appreciating his support during a difficult time where she felt judged by the world.</p>

            <p>Alaska lawmakers are grappling with budget uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs and fluctuating oil prices, complicating their efforts to craft a state budget. The legislative session is set to end in mid-May, well before Trump's recently announced pause on higher tariffs for many countries expires. The volatility has intensified debates over how much money should be allocated to the yearly oil-wealth fund check versus essential services like education. Lawmakers are hesitant to raise taxes and have depleted billions in savings to address recurring budget deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Residents in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, express concerns about the increasing risk of wildfires near their homes due to climate change.

Firefighters have struggled to contain recent blazes, raising concerns about resource availability and the impact on wildlife. Controlled burns are a common practice to mitigate wildfire risk, but can sometimes get out of control.</p>

The move reflects a shift towards greater state intervention in key industries, driven by economic and political considerations.

            <p>A push by Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna to allow proxy voting for new parents has sparked a debate in the U.S. House. Luna, unable to travel to Washington after childbirth, sought to change House rules. The issue, initially focused on new mothers, expanded to include all new parents, leading to a standoff and raising questions about accommodating working parents in Congress. A compromise was reached to implement a vote-pairing system, but the issue remains contentious.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite objections from the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. The brothers were convicted of killing their parents in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison. Former DA George Gascón had filed a motion to reduce their sentences, but the current DA sought to withdraw that motion. The decision came after a roughly six-hour proceeding, during which the brothers appeared together virtually.</p>

The state's Department of Education argues that DEI efforts are legal and that the federal request is vague. California joins other states in challenging the administration's stance on DEI.

            <p>After becoming the latest target of President Donald Trump, the law firm Susman Godfrey filed a lawsuit Friday night to block what it says is the president's "blatantly unconstitutional" executive order against it. The firm has represented the voting machine company Dominion, famously securing a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News. The firm says Trump is trying to "punish" them for their work "defending the integrity of the 2020 presidential election." If the Executive Orders are allowed to stand, future presidents will face no constraint when they seek to retaliate against a different set of perceived foes.</p>
