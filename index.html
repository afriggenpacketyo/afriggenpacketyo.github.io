          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed former biotech executive George Tidmarsh as its new director for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. This move comes amid significant upheaval at the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pursued staff cuts and expressed vaccine skepticism. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background and previous hardline regulatory stances are seen by some as a potential stabilizing force for the pharmaceutical industry. His appointment is expected to influence key FDA policies, including the controversial accelerated approval process for new drugs.</p>

          <p>A High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group, allowing the All England Club's plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to move forward. The proposal includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on land formerly occupied by a golf club. Opponents argued the development was unlawful as the land was protected, but the judge ruled the planning decision was rationally exercised. While the club celebrated the victory, the campaign group, Save Wimbledon Park, has indicated it may appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>As gold prices hover around $3,300 per ounce, market experts are divided on whether the precious metal can reach the $3,500 threshold by the end of July. Some analysts believe it's unlikely without a Federal Reserve interest rate cut or a major new economic headwind, citing the short timeframe and recent price consolidation. Others note that a significant catalyst, such as a shift in trade policy, could trigger a rapid price surge. Key factors influencing gold's trajectory include central bank purchasing activity, geopolitical events, inflation data, and the strength of the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a comprehensive examination of the Federal Reserve, questioning its overall mission and success amid growing White House criticism. The comments escalate a conflict between the administration and the central bank, which has included unconfirmed reports of plans to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent suggested the Fed should be easing its benchmark rate due to moderating inflation and criticized the institution's mindset. This call for a review reflects deep tensions over monetary policy and the Fed's institutional independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Imposing August 1 Tariffs Seen as Negotiating Tactic, Says Treasury Secretary</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration views the planned August 1 tariffs as a negotiating tool to pressure trade partners into more favorable agreements. His remarks suggest the date is not a firm deadline for deals but rather an escalation of leverage, implying talks could continue even after steep levies are imposed. This stance creates uncertainty for investors and importers, who are weighing whether the administration will follow through on the tariffs or postpone them again. Bessent emphasized that the quality of trade deals is more important than the timing. (not investment advice)</p>

This suggestion comes as federal authorities consider unsealing grand jury materials related to the case.

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is facing federal human smuggling charges, have requested a 30-day delay on his potential release from criminal custody. The request aims to give them time to address likely deportation efforts by the Department of Homeland Security if he is released. Abrego Garcia was erroneously deported to El Salvador earlier this year despite having a protective order, and was later returned to the U.S. to face the criminal indictment. His case involves a complex legal tangle between the criminal justice system and immigration authorities, with his freedom from one form of custody potentially leading to another.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, nations in the eastern part of the continent have struggled to achieve comparable success. This article examines the reasons for this disparity, pointing to a combination of cultural norms that view football as a "man's game," a lack of investment, and the historical legacy of post-communist economic struggles. While UEFA initiatives are beginning to show results and participation is growing, experts argue that societal shifts and greater financial support for infrastructure and professionalization are needed for the region to catch up with its western counterparts.</p>

          <p>England rugby officials filed a complaint with World Rugby after replacement players were subjected to racial abuse from a small group of spectators during a Test match against Argentina. The governing body conducted an investigation, which included witness statements and video analysis, and confirmed that an incident took place. However, World Rugby and the Argentine Rugby Union stated that they were unable to identify the individuals responsible from the crowd of over 20,000. Both organizations condemned the discriminatory behavior and expressed solidarity with the affected England players.</p>

          <p>A Bangladesh Air Force training aircraft crashed into a school campus in the capital city of Dhaka, resulting in the deaths of at least 19 people, including the pilot and numerous students. The Chinese-made F-7 BGI jet went down shortly after takeoff and immediately caught fire on the grounds of the Milestone School and College while classes were in session. The crash, the cause of which is under investigation, also injured over 100 people and created a desperate scene as rescuers and parents rushed to help wounded students.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its iconic, half-century-old open seating policy, announcing that it will transition to assigned seats on January 27. This major shift is part of a broader overhaul of the airline's business model, which also includes new fare types and bag fees, aimed at boosting revenue. The carrier has designed a new eight-group boarding process based on elite status, fare class, and seat location to replace its current A-B-C system. The move marks a fundamental change for the airline as it seeks to align more closely with its industry rivals.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the quirky but relevant question of whether pets need sunscreen. Veterinarians and zookeepers explain that animals, especially those with light-colored or sparse fur like certain dog breeds, pigs, and even elephants, can suffer from sunburns and develop skin cancer. While the idea may seem strange to many pet owners, experts recommend applying sunscreen as a preventative measure. The piece discusses the challenges of application, the types of products to use, and how selective breeding has created domestic animals that are more vulnerable to sun damage than their wild ancestors.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ruled that a death-row inmate's implanted heart defibrillator must be turned off moments before his scheduled lethal injection. The ruling addresses concerns from Byron Black's attorneys that the device could repeatedly and painfully shock him as the execution drug stops his heart. Black, 69 and in poor health, is scheduled for execution on August 5 for a 1988 triple murder. The decision adds another complex medical and ethical layer to the case, as the state must now find a medical professional willing to perform the deactivation procedure just before the execution.</p>

The company, which produces Jeep and Ram vehicles, cited the impact of U.S. tariffs, production losses, and significant pre-tax charges as primary reasons for the anticipated loss. These charges are related to restructuring costs and program cancellations.
