          <p>A federal judge has mandated that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI must proceed in Fort Worth, Texas, despite minimal geographic ties for the companies. The judge, Mark Pittman, ironically suggested the tech giants relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, criticizing the practice of 'forum-shopping' for favorable rulings. This lawsuit alleges an anticompetitive scheme by Apple and OpenAI to monopolize AI markets, with X accusing Apple of favoring ChatGPT on its App Store over competitors like xAI's Grok. Pittman's decision, though made with reservations, was influenced by the defendants' failure to request a venue transfer.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that in today's multipolar world, major global powers must learn from history, specifically the example of Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's diplomatic accommodation. The piece highlights that the current era is defined by nuclear deterrence, making total war irrational, and unprecedented technological interdependence, which creates immense costs for systemic ruptures. These factors necessitate patient statecraft to manage hegemonic transitions, rather than confrontation, to avoid catastrophic miscalculation. The article underscores the urgent need for institutional adaptation to navigate the shift from American unipolarity.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen dominated the United States Grand Prix in Austin, converting his pole position into a commanding win and his seventh at the circuit. This victory significantly reduced his championship deficit to McLaren's Oscar Piastri to 40 points, with Lando Norris finishing second and Piastri fifth. Norris managed to overtake Ferrari's Charles Leclerc late in the race to boost his own championship hopes against Piastri. Verstappen's performance, his fifth win of the season, puts him firmly in contention for the title after a strong weekend that also included a sprint race win.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Uncover How Easter Island's Moai Statues 'Walked' to Their Locations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers believe they have finally solved the centuries-old mystery of how Easter Island's massive Moai statues were transported. A new study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science suggests the statues were 'walked' vertically from the quarry, aligning with Rapa Nui legend. Using 3D modeling, scientists Carl P. Lipo and Terry L. Hunt found that the Moai's D-shaped bases and forward lean allowed for efficient rope transport by teams of people. This method, requiring minimal resources, highlights sophisticated engineering and contradicts theories of environmental destruction.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' reveals her fears of dying as a 'sex slave' within Jeffrey Epstein's circle. The book, published nearly six months after her death, also reiterates her claims of having sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including one involving Epstein and other young women. Prince Andrew has consistently denied these allegations, reaching a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022 and recently relinquishing royal titles. The memoir provides disturbing details of Epstein's sex trafficking, including requirements for girls to appear 'childlike' and instances of physical abuse.</p>

          <p>Millions across the US participated in 'No Kings' demonstrations, peacefully protesting President Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. The rallies, which surpassed previous turnouts, showcased a united front of Democrats, liberals, and anti-Trump Republicans, despite the left's limited national power. While Republicans downplayed the events, the scale suggests potential for a Democratic rebound, though the party faces low favorability and internal divisions. The protests also underscored frustrations with the ongoing government shutdown and the need for a more combative Democratic strategy.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries visited Black churches in Los Angeles to campaign for California's Proposition 50, a redistricting effort aimed at adding Democratic congressional seats.

Proposition 50, which would temporarily allow California to redraw its maps to counter Republican moves in Texas, is framed as a fight for a 'level playing field.' The initiative faces criticism from California Republicans, who label it a 'big scam' and hypocritical.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson called the arrest of Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub Al-Muhtadi, an alleged Hamas terrorist linked to the October 7 attack, 'alarming' and blamed the former Biden administration's border policies. Al-Muhtadi, a Gazan native, allegedly entered the US in September 2024 on a fraudulent visa, nearly a year after the attack. Johnson asserted that the 'wide-open border' allowed terrorists into the country, warning of long-term ramifications. Attorney General Pamela Bondi praised the arrest, calling Al-Muhtadi a 'monster' who participated in the 'deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust.'</p>

          <p>Atlanta United has fired coach Ronny Deila following a disappointing 5-13-16 season, his first in charge, which saw the team win only one of its last 18 matches. Despite high expectations, including significant transfer spending and re-signing key players, the club finished 14th in the Eastern Conference. CEO Garth Lagerwey stated that the team's standard of play was not met and a global search for a replacement would begin immediately. Deila, who previously led New York City FC to an MLS Cup title, was hired in December 2024 on a three-year deal.</p>

          <p>President Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an 'illegal drug dealer' and threatened to cut US funding, escalating tensions after the US military struck another vessel linked to a Colombian rebel group.

Trump blamed Petro for encouraging drug production, while Petro accused the US of 'murder' following a September strike that killed a Colombian fisherman.

          <p>President Trump reportedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to accept Russia's terms for ending the war, warning of Ukraine's 'destruction' if he refused. According to the Financial Times, Trump insisted Zelenskiy surrender the eastern Donbas region, echoing President Putin's talking points from a prior call. Ukraine eventually swayed Trump to endorse a freeze of current front lines. Putin had offered smaller parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for larger parts of Donbas.

Lagarde also noted signs of the dollar's erosion as a safe haven, pointing to the rise of cryptocurrency and gold prices, attributing this to geopolitical credibility and institutional strength. Additionally, a segment covered universities' widespread rejection of a Trump administration compact proposing federal funding for aligning with specific priorities, including limiting speech and race-based admissions, raising concerns about academic freedom and institutional autonomy.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, hosting 'Saturday Night Live,' cleverly used her appearance to push back against critics of her provocative public persona and recent album, 'Man’s Best Friend.' In a QVC sketch, she played a designer oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her neck pillow, mirroring reactions to her 'winking pop persona.' Her opening monologue directly addressed the album cover controversy, while a 'girlboss' sketch satirized the policing of female confidence. Carpenter's performance suggested that she is in on the joke, dismissing concerns about her sexuality as misplaced and engaging with the discourse on her own terms.</p>

Conversely, Republican Senator Katie Britt insisted Democrats should 'do the right thing' and reopen the government first before any discussions.
