        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has reported that the Home Office is unaware if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee criticized the department for failing to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. The report highlights a reliance on unanalyzed airline passenger records and accuses the Home Office of showing little interest in how the system operates. It also points to widespread evidence of worker exploitation, which the department has been slow to address.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys to prevent addiction among children, analysts believe toy company Pop Mart will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults and millennials, not the minors targeted by the proposed regulations. Furthermore, Pop Mart is increasingly diversifying its revenue streams with significant overseas sales growth, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, which is expected to cushion any domestic regulatory impact. The company's strategy focuses on creating "affordable exclusivity" for its collectors, driving its popularity despite a broader economic slowdown in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland. The event was witnessed by dozens of people who reported an orange glow and a loud bang, with the meteor's descent captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely descended to about 12 miles above the ground. Fragments may be scattered across a vast, mountainous area between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht, and hillwalkers are being asked to look out for them.</p>

          <p>An ongoing strike by French air traffic controllers has caused major disruptions to summer travel, leading to the cancellation of approximately 40% of flights at Paris airports. The national civil aviation authority requested airlines to preemptively cancel numerous flights across France, including in Nice, Marseille, and Lyon. The strike, led by unions demanding better pay to cope with inflation and protesting a lack of staff to handle surging travel, has affected tens of thousands of passengers. Despite the cancellations, authorities warned that significant disruptions and long delays are still expected at all French airports.</p>

          <p>Russia has officially become the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, a move the Taliban's foreign minister called "courageous." The decision was conveyed by Russia's ambassador in Kabul and is seen by the Taliban as a potential example for other nations. Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban has sought international recognition despite widespread condemnation of its human rights violations, particularly the severe restrictions imposed on women and girls. Russia, which was one of the few countries to keep its embassy open in Kabul, stated the move will boost bilateral cooperation.</p>

          <p>A drive-by shooting outside a Chicago restaurant and lounge has left four people dead and at least fourteen others wounded. The incident occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police believe the attack was targeted, with some victims being part of the rapper's inner circle, and are investigating it as a possible gang-related conflict. Authorities have shut down the venue and are increasing police presence to prevent potential retaliation while the search for the three suspected shooters continues. This is the second mass shooting at the same location since 2022.</p>

          <p>China's government has renewed its commitment to tackling the persistent issues of oversupply and excessive competition within its solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a recent meeting with industry leaders, the Minister of Industry and Information Technology stated that "disorderly low-price competition" must be comprehensively addressed. The government aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and promoting the orderly phase-out of outdated production capacity. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's call to remove excess industrial capacity and comes as China's solar industry continues its expansion into global markets.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day visit to rural South Carolina, a state with an early and influential presidential primary, further fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. The tour will take him through eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, many of which are Republican strongholds. While a political advisor insists the visit is focused on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms and highlighting rural issues, the trip is widely seen as an effort to build a national profile. This follows several other high-profile overtures Newsom has made to Southern voters.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress have filed a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or dismantle a federal agency created by Congress. The suit was filed after the administration took steps to downsize the department, including a major workforce reduction and pausing over $6 billion in congressionally approved education programs. The legal challenge seeks to compel the department to fulfill its statutory obligations to students nationwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the National Park Service to develop a strategy for charging higher entrance fees to foreign visitors. The order aims to raise funds for park improvements while keeping prices low for American citizens, under an "America First" policy for national parks. The Interior Department estimates such a surcharge could generate over $90 million annually. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. residents in park access systems like lotteries or permits. This move comes as the administration has been reducing the Park Service's staff and budget.</p>

          <p>Recent data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in ICE detention, which has swelled to at least 56,000 people. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of those currently detained have no criminal record, a number that has almost doubled since May. This trend appears to contradict administration claims of focusing on violent criminals, instead reflecting a broader enforcement strategy where being in the U.S. without legal status is sufficient grounds for detention. The policy has led to the deportation of long-term residents with deep community ties.</p>
