          <p>The UK government has announced a judge-led public inquiry into the Nottingham attacks that resulted in the deaths of Barnaby Webber, Grace O'Malley-Kumar, and Ian Coates. The inquiry, chaired by Her Honour Deborah Taylor, will investigate the events of June 13, 2023, when Valdo Calocane fatally stabbed the three victims. The inquiry will have the power to compel witnesses and thoroughly assess the facts, addressing criticisms from the victims' families regarding the handling of the case by authorities. Calocane, diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, was sentenced to a hospital order after admitting to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and attempted murder.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under fire for allegedly sharing unclassified information about potential U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a Signal group including family members. Hegseth denies sharing classified war plans, claiming the information was informal coordination for media purposes. He accuses former staffers, recently dismissed as part of a leak investigation, of leaking information to sabotage President Trump's agenda at the Pentagon. Hegseth maintains his focus remains on bringing warfighting back to the Pentagon, despite criticisms and calls for his resignation from congressional Democrats and even some Republicans.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $90,000 mark as investors seek alternative assets amidst turbulent stock market conditions and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent surge coincides with increased pressure from President Trump on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, suggesting a decoupling from traditional risk assets. Analysts note Bitcoin's resilience but caution that breaking above the $93,000 resistance level may require a stronger catalyst. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025, citing an escalating trade war. The IMF projects a growth rate of 1.8%, a decrease from previous estimates, and has also increased the likelihood of a recession. The organization attributes the slowdown to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policy and its negative impact on global trade. The IMF also reduced its global economic growth forecast, warning that further escalation of the trade war could hinder both near- and long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has unveiled a plan to reorganize the U.S. State Department, aiming to reform the department amidst criticism from the Trump White House. The reorganization involves closing overseas missions, reducing staff, and minimizing offices focused on promoting liberal values, with the goal of integrating them into regional bureaus. Rubio claims the existing bureaucracy prioritizes radical political ideology over America's national interests. The plan seeks to empower the department from the ground up, consolidating region-specific functions and eliminating redundant offices and programs.</p>

          <p>Vladimir Putin has signaled potential openness to direct talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky, marking the first such indication since the early stages of the war. However, Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continued even after Putin's comments. Putin stated that Russia has "always looked positively on any peace initiatives." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov clarified that Putin's remarks indicate a willingness to discuss avoiding strikes on civilian targets. President Zelensky has proposed a 30-day ceasefire on long-range strikes on civilian infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students, granting temporary restraining orders on their behalf. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending the students' statuses and making them deportable. The judge rejected government arguments that granting relief would affect the executive branch's control over immigration.</p>
