        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC and production company Banijay have confirmed that John Torode's contract as a MasterChef presenter will not be renewed. The decision follows an independent investigation that upheld an allegation against Torode for using "an extremely offensive racist term" in the workplace. Torode has denied the allegation, stating he has no memory of the incident and finds such language unacceptable. This development adds to the crisis surrounding the show, as his co-host Gregg Wallace was also recently dismissed amid separate allegations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with Indonesia, which he described as a "great deal, for everybody." The announcement, made on Truth Social, came a week after Trump had threatened a 32% tariff on Indonesian exports to the U.S. and follows what he termed direct dealings with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. While Trump provided no specific details, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Indonesia would drop its tariffs on U.S. goods as part of the agreement, which involves a trade partnership valued at over $38 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index indicated that the annual inflation rate rose to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% in May, aligning with economists' expectations. The increase was driven by factors including President Trump's tariff policies, with higher grocery prices partially offset by lower gasoline costs. Economists anticipate that the full impact of tariffs will become more evident in the latter half of the year as businesses can no longer absorb the increased import duties. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, registered a 2.9% increase for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly restricted the ability of immigrants in detention to be released on bond while awaiting deportation hearings. Through a reinterpretation of a 1990s law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now argues that noncitizens who entered the U.S. illegally, regardless of how long ago, are not eligible for bond hearings. This new policy mandates their detention unless ICE officials grant them "parole," shifting discretion away from immigration judges. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown, facilitated by increased funding intended to expand detention capacity significantly.</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets from a U.S. facility and collaborate on a new recycling line in California. This partnership is a significant step in Apple's plan to strengthen its domestic supply chain and reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global rare earths market. MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S., will begin shipping the magnets, essential components in electronics like the iPhone, in 2027. The deal is part of Apple's broader commitment to invest over $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that after years of fueling conspiracy theories about Epstein, the administration's recent announcement that it found no evidence to support them has backfired, causing a revolt within the MAGA media ecosystem. The columnist suggests that President Trump's frustration and inability to silence questions about the topic, from both reporters and his own supporters, is a significant sign of his waning influence over his own coalition, regardless of the facts of the Epstein case itself.</p>

President Trump and his allies accuse the department of overreach, while its responsibilities include administering federal student loans, funding programs for low-income students, and enforcing civil rights laws in schools.
