Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves all options to defend itself, raising concerns about regional escalation.

He highlighted that the U.S. is ready to negotiate a deal beneficial for Iran, its people, and global security if Iran chooses diplomacy, but warned of consequences if they opt for a different path. Rubio also addressed concerns about Iran's uranium enrichment levels and missile development programs, underscoring the U.S. commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

He voiced concern over the strikes being undertaken without Congressional authorization, emphasizing Congress's constitutional authority to declare war.

Cities like Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia are expecting heat indices to surpass 100Â°F, prompting public health departments to declare heat emergencies and offer cooling centers. The extreme heat has already affected athletes and outdoor events, leading to cancellations and adjustments to accommodate the conditions.

India held a narrow lead of 96 runs at the close of play after Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2. Brook's innings, which included some audacious shots, helped England recover from a deficit, although he missed out on a century after being caught while attempting a hook shot.

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher after the United States launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would help end the conflict, despite Iran's insistence on not returning to diplomacy while under attack. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf region's call for appeasement and peaceful resolution has helped it isolate itself from the conflict, minimizing market impact.</p>

          <p>The United States has entered the war between Israel and Iran, bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. This marks a critical escalation in the Middle East.

The bulletin does not specify any current, credible threats, but cautions about potential low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and possible attacks against U.S. networks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. It highlights the disruption of multiple Iranian-backed plots in the U.S. since 2020 and the potential for the Israel-Iran conflict to motivate violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators. Law enforcement agencies are increasing security measures at religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests five alternative phrases to replace toxic ones that cause children to refuse to listen. Instead of saying "Because I said so," parents should explain their reasoning to foster respect and understanding. Rather than threatening with privilege removal, offering choices and agency can encourage cooperation. Acknowledging and validating children's emotions, rather than dismissing them, promotes emotional safety and trust. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, building a stronger connection and raising emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service, giving a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis in Austin, Texas. The pilot program, likely involving a small number of cars in a geofenced area, aims to gather feedback from early access riders. Elon Musk has previously stated the cars will be "in the wild with no one in them," and plans to scale up the service rapidly. Safety concerns and regulatory scrutiny surround autonomous vehicles, with Tesla under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and facing calls to delay the launch until new safety laws take effect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. conducted a top-secret precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, code-named "Operation Midnight Hammer," utilizing B-2 stealth bombers and Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bombs. The mission, described as the largest strike using B-2 bombers in history, targeted the Natanz, Fordo, and Isfahan sites, with officials claiming "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated." The operation involved over 125 aircraft, including decoy bombers and refueling tankers, and was executed with minimal communication to avoid detection.

          <p>NATO members have reached an agreement to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a goal long advocated by President Trump. Spain initially opposed the measure but secured an exemption, deeming the 5% target "disproportionate and unnecessary." Except for Spain, all member nations have until 2035 to meet the 5% goal, allocating at least 3.5% to core military needs and 1.5% to related expenditures.
