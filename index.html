          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into former President Biden and his aides, focusing on conspiracy theories and questioning the legality of Biden's actions while in office. The executive order directs the Attorney General and the president's counsel to investigate what Trump claims is an abuse of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the president's authorities. Biden has dismissed these attacks as false and a distraction. </p>

          <p>The first New York City mayoral debate saw former Governor Andrew Cuomo, the front-runner, facing attacks from his Democratic rivals. The candidates debated issues facing New York City, including housing, affordability, crime, policing, public safety, and how they would handle the Trump administration if elected. Cuomo was criticized for his record, his handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, and sexual harassment allegations. The crowded stage featured a number of candidates who launched attacks at Cuomo's record, but Cuomo insisted that nursing home deaths were not undercounted.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to pause operations at Job Corps centers nationwide has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge after Job Corps contractors sued, arguing the Labor Department violated federal law.

Students and lawmakers from both parties have denounced the move, highlighting the program's importance for disadvantaged youth.

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The research indicates that good bacteria can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The study found that Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, appeared to have a protective effect, with only 4% of babies with this species needing hospitalization for lung infections.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp. The order halts restart efforts on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The fire marshal regulates oil and gas pipelines across the state and must approve the pipelines' full restart, which is key to the company's commercial success. Sable officials said the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline to August 1, 2025.</p>

Drug safety experts in the UK say it is not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby. The advice already appears in patient information leaflets, but there are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women are not using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines, known as Wegovy, Mounjaro, Saxenda, Victoza and Ozempic, are not being used safely.</p>
