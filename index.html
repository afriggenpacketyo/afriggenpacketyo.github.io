          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called "study mode" within ChatGPT, designed to assist students by guiding them through problems step-by-step rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address educators' concerns about AI being used for cheating and to encourage critical thinking among its large student user base. When using study mode, students will receive guiding questions for homework, test preparation, and learning new subjects. The feature will be available for most ChatGPT users and will soon be integrated into ChatGPT Edu, the version designed specifically for universities, as part of OpenAI's effort to improve learning with AI.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan mass shooting, who killed four people before taking his own life, left a note claiming he suffered from CTE and specifically mentioned the NFL. The 27-year-old gunman, a former high school football player with no known connection to the league, reportedly took the wrong elevator, attacking employees at a management firm instead of the NFL headquarters. His note asked for his brain to be studied, highlighting ongoing concerns about brain injuries in football. The incident has prompted renewed calls from New York officials for a national assault weapons ban.</p>

          <p>The French seaside resort of Les Sables-d’Olonne is enforcing a ban on tourists wearing only swimwear in the town center, imposing fines up to $175 for violations. The town's mayor stated the rule is a matter of respect for local residents and basic hygiene in public spaces like shops and markets. This crackdown is part of a broader trend of vacation destinations addressing issues related to overtourism and tourist behavior. The campaign, under the slogan "respect doesn’t go on holiday," clarifies that swimwear is appropriate on the town's extensive beaches but not within the main town area itself.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key scientific determination that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal basis for numerous climate regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as "the largest deregulatory action in the history of America," claiming it would save Americans over a trillion dollars. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have condemned the decision, calling it illegal and dangerous, and have vowed to challenge it in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's job approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 has fallen dramatically since his inauguration, dropping from 55% to 28%. According to a CBS News analysis, this decline is most pronounced among less partisan and politically unengaged young people, particularly young men. A majority of young voters now feel the economy is worsening and that the administration is focusing too much on issues like tariffs and deportations while neglecting to lower prices. This reversal suggests that the initial support from young voters, which was stronger in the 2024 election, may have been a temporary reaction to economic concerns rather than a lasting political shift.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, a move that would solidify its position as the largest U.S. credit card issuer. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the high-growth but financially challenging consumer card business would mark the end of a difficult chapter. The partnership had faced regulatory scrutiny and concerns over potential loan losses. For Apple, a deal with the more experienced JPMorgan could bring greater stability to its credit card operations after a period of rapid expansion under Goldman's management. The transition would represent a significant shift in the consumer finance landscape.</p>

The cubs, born at Manor House Wildlife Park, are part of a European breeding program designed to maintain genetic diversity among the tiger population, of which fewer than 400 remain in the wild. Officials at the park kept the news private for six weeks to allow the cubs to settle in with their mother. These cubs will eventually join the global breeding program to help secure the future of their species.</p>

Despite this support, developers still face challenges from high interest rates, construction costs, and local opposition (NIMBYism).

This quiet integration into the European golf scene has occurred with little public backlash, signaling a pragmatic business approach from the tour.

The UN-backed experts report mounting evidence that widespread starvation, severe malnutrition, and disease are causing a rise in hunger-related deaths. Key famine thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have reportedly been met in parts of the territory. UN agencies attribute the man-made crisis to Israel's control over aid entry, which has been severely restricted.

          <p>Amid reports of catastrophic hunger in places like Gaza, this article explains the physiological process of starvation. When deprived of food, the body first consumes its carbohydrate stores, then transitions to burning fat, and finally begins breaking down its own muscle and organ proteins for energy. This final stage leads to severe muscle wasting, a weakened immune system, and organ failure, with death often resulting from infection or cardiac arrest. Children are especially vulnerable due to their higher energy needs for growth and lower reserves. The article underscores that while the biological process is complex, the treatment is simple: food and water.</p>

          <p>British Transport Police are seeking to question far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, in connection with an alleged assault at St Pancras railway station in London. Officers found a man with serious but non-life-threatening injuries on Monday evening. Authorities stated that a 42-year-old male suspect boarded a flight out of the country early Tuesday morning. Video footage circulating on social media shows Robinson near a man lying motionless on the station floor, though the clip does not depict the preceding incident. Police are investigating and have urged anyone with information to come forward.</p>

          <p>PayPal's stock fell over 8% after the company reported second-quarter results that, while beating revenue and earnings estimates, revealed slowing growth in transaction margin dollars, a key profitability metric. The digital payments firm saw a 7% rise in this figure, but this was a sequential slowdown from the previous quarter. Additionally, operating expenses increased and adjusted free cash flow fell significantly below expectations. CEO Alex Chriss has been working to streamline the company by moving away from lower-margin revenue streams, but the report indicates ongoing challenges in its turnaround efforts.

          <p>The Nuremberg Zoo in Germany is facing harsh criticism and legal threats from animal rights groups after it euthanized 12 healthy Guinea baboons.

The zoo's baboon population had grown to 40 in a facility designed for 25.
