          <h2>US and China Resume Trade Talks Amid Tariff Tensions</h2>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations, the first high-stakes talks since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Expectations for a breakthrough are low, with analysts anticipating discussions to focus on each side's demands and future negotiation strategies. The economic impact of the tariffs is already evident, with China reporting a 21 percent drop in exports to the U.S. in April. Despite the challenges, the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes for de-escalation, although a durable resolution remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>As trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, Beijing has strategically imposed export controls on rare earth elements, critical components in the manufacturing of military and commercial products. China, the world's leading producer of these elements, has placed restrictions on key medium and heavy rare earths in response to increased U.S. tariffs. This move has sparked concern within the U.S. defense industry, as rare earths are essential for technologies used in jet engines, radar systems, and avionics. The export controls went into effect in April, further complicating the already strained trade relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. According to the family's attorney, this decision was made to allow the family time to consider their options and address the trauma they have experienced. A federal judge previously expressed concerns about the deportation, noting the lack of due process. The Department of Justice responded that it was in the child's best interest to remain with her mother, despite her U.S. citizenship.</p>

While there was no immediate indication of progress, initial discussions likely focused on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal. President Trump suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its tariffs first.</p>

The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's money to pay off earlier investors and fund a lavish lifestyle.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except where explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the 'social cost of carbon,' a metric used to weigh the economic costs and benefits of policies limiting carbon pollution. The administration cited uncertainties in calculating the figure and questioned the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and environmental groups have criticized the move as a denial of reality, while industry groups have supported limiting the application of the social cost of carbon.</p>

US President Donald Trump reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire after a phone call with Starmer, following Vladimir Putin's rejection of an initial proposal in March. The leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that new and massive sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire.</p>

The President's tariffs are also creating uncertainty, threatening both growth and inflation.

          <p>Ramona Sarsgaard, the daughter of actors Maggie Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, was among those arrested at Columbia University during anti-war protests against Israel's actions in Gaza. The 18-year-old freshman received a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing after students occupied part of the Butler library building. The university called in the police, leading to multiple arrests. Student journalists reporting on the protests were temporarily suspended. The demonstrations are part of a broader wave of student-led activism against the Trump administration's crackdowns on free speech.</p>

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved significant milestones in exploring Venus.
