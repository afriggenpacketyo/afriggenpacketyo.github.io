          <p>A Harris's hawk, notorious for dive-bombing residents in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home by a local falconer. The hawk, dubbed "Bomber Harris," had attacked around 50 people, leading to injuries and disrupted postal services. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, observing that its aggressive behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial reasons. Housden invested in building an aviary for the hawk and plans to feature it at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival, and he intends to eventually let it fly freely, hoping it will return. The falconer believes the hawk was a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and he is committed to providing it with a stable and caring environment.</p>

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is facing increasing challenges as its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) encounters new obstacles. The company is now reportedly considering a Hong Kong listing after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators for its planned London IPO. Shein has been under scrutiny regarding allegations of forced labor and breaches of consumer protection laws, including misleading sustainability claims. Additionally, the closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods has added to the company's difficulties. These mounting issues have made it difficult for Shein to achieve its listing ambitions.</p>

          <p>Glaciers worldwide are melting at an alarming rate, impacting water supply, ecosystems, and infrastructure. The collapse of the Birch Glacier in the Swiss Alps demonstrates the risks, causing debris to clog rivers and increasing flood potential. Two billion people rely on glacial melt for daily water needs, but as glaciers shrink, water scarcity and infrastructure damage become more prevalent. Melting ice sheets also contribute to rising sea levels, threatening low-lying islands and coastal cities. Communities are adapting through early warning systems and artificial glaciers, but slowing global warming is crucial to mitigate these far-reaching consequences.</p>

At age 12, Musk created the video game Blastar, and later co-founded Zip2, which sold for $300 million. He also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and was the original founder of X.com, which later became PayPal. Moreover, Musk's persona influenced Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark, and while he didn't start Tesla, he propelled it to global success. Musk's ambition to create an "everything app" is now being realized through X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>

          <p>A New York court's ruling against President Trump's blanket tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs ruled illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this agreement is not yet in effect. The ruling blocks Trump's 10% blanket tariffs on other UK goods like salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal, creating uncertainty for British exporters.

Opposition parties have submitted separate bills with varying approaches, including allowing couples to choose surnames and determining children's surnames upon marriage.

          <p>President Trump criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America," after a panel of judges ruled most of his tariffs illegal. Trump expressed disappointment in the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided poor advice on judicial nominations. This outburst followed a ruling against Trump's tariffs by judges, including a Trump appointee, citing right-leaning legal theories. The president's attack is notable given Leo's role in advising Trump on Supreme Court picks and shaping the conservative legal movement.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly entering into mega drug-licensing deals with multinational companies, driven by cost savings and depressed valuations. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group's potential multibillion-dollar deal is the latest example of this trend, which involves licensing development rights for innovative medicines. Many deals utilize a "newco structure," combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend is expected to continue, with both the number and value of deals exceeding previous years. The move offers an alternative to raising funds by selling shares amid challenging market conditions.</p>
