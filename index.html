          <p>Kate Forbes, Scotland's Deputy First Minister, has announced she will not seek re-election in the upcoming 2026 Holyrood election. The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP cited a desire to spend more time with her young family as the primary reason for her decision to step down. Forbes, who will continue to serve as an MSP for another nine months, expressed her continued support for First Minister John Swinney and the Scottish National Party's goals. Swinney praised Forbes for her invaluable contribution to public life over the past decade, acknowledging the significant challenges of frontline politics.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has released a musical advertisement titled "Everything is Fine," which satirically portrays the U.K. as a nation struggling with economic issues like strikes and a cost-of-living crisis. The ad has sparked a significant debate, with figures in the fintech and venture capital sectors largely praising its message, while others criticize it as a misleading self-promotion. The ad has been interpreted as a critique of the U.K. government's handling of the economy and its regulatory approach to the crypto industry. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated the ad's theme is about updating a financial system that isn't working for many people, a message he claims is not specific to the U.K. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly instructed NASA to develop plans to terminate at least two critical Earth-observing satellite missions, the Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCO). These missions provide vital data on carbon dioxide levels and plant growth, used by scientists, farmers, and companies. If the plans proceed, one of the satellites would be deorbited and destroyed in the atmosphere, despite a 2023 NASA review confirming its high-quality data and recommending its continuation. Critics, including congressional Democrats, argue that ending these missions would be catastrophic for climate and weather forecasting and that the administration may be illegally halting congressionally appropriated funds.</p>

          <p>Health officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip reported on Monday that five adults have died from malnutrition within the last 24 hours. This recent update brings the total number of deaths attributed to hunger since the conflict began nearly two years ago to 180. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, this total includes 93 children who have succumbed to malnutrition. The ongoing crisis highlights the severe humanitarian conditions prevailing in the territory as the conflict continues to impact the civilian population's access to basic necessities and food.</p>

          <p>Two men have appeared in court in connection with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton, England. Ahmad Mulakhil is charged with sexual assault, while Mohammad Kabir faces charges of kidnap, strangulation, and aiding the assault. The case has drawn political attention after a local council leader alleged the men were asylum seekers and accused authorities of a cover-up, a claim the BBC could not verify. Warwickshire Police and the Home Office have declined to release the men's immigration status, citing national guidance for active legal proceedings, which has fueled further controversy.</p>

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a trade body for the UK car finance industry, has labeled the financial regulator's proposed redress scheme for mis-sold car loans as "completely impractical." The main concern is the scheme's retroactive scope, which could cover loans from as far back as 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack necessary paperwork. While a Supreme Court ruling limited the scope of claims, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is still developing a compensation plan for cases with particularly large commissions, estimated to cost the industry between £9bn and £18bn.

          <p>In a significant move to bolster maritime cooperation, India and the Philippines have conducted their first-ever joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea. The two-day patrol, involving three Indian vessels and two Filipino frigates, coincides with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos's state visit to New Delhi. This collaboration is seen as a direct response to China's expansive claims in the region and follows a series of confrontations between the Philippines and China. Filipino military officials reported being shadowed by Chinese vessels during the exercise but noted no untoward incidents occurred, expressing hope for future joint maneuvers.</p>

          <p>India is facing a complex diplomatic and economic challenge following U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose a "penalty" and a 25% tariff over its continued importation of Russian oil. Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia has become India's top oil supplier, with imports surging dramatically due to discounted prices. Indian officials have remained noncommittal, stating their energy decisions are based on market prices and global conditions. Analysts suggest that while India is currently not altering its long-term contracts with Russia, the U.S. pressure presents a significant risk, forcing New Delhi to weigh its energy needs against its relationship with Washington.

          <p>The practice of African leaders and elites seeking medical treatment abroad has drawn scrutiny to the state of healthcare systems across the continent. This article explores the underlying reasons, including a lack of specialized treatments, poorly equipped local hospitals, and low government investment in public health. Many African Union member states have failed to meet the Abuja Declaration's target of allocating 15% of their national budgets to healthcare, leading to an over-reliance on foreign aid and underperforming systems. Consequently, countries like India attract hundreds of thousands of African patients annually, representing a significant outflow of funds that could otherwise be invested in local infrastructure.</p>

U.S. export controls have inadvertently created an opportunity for domestic Chinese chipmakers like Huawei and Cambricon to grow, with one report forecasting Nvidia's China market share to drop to 54% in 2025 from 66% in 2024. Furthermore, Beijing is increasing its scrutiny, recently summoning Nvidia over national security concerns, signaling an intent to steer local companies toward homegrown AI infrastructure and reduce dependency on U.S. technology.

          <p>The unofficial annual summer retreat for China's senior political leadership has commenced at the seaside resort of Beidaihe. The start of the gathering was signaled by the public appearance of Cai Qi, a high-ranking Communist Party official, at a meeting with technology experts and scholars at the resort. During this retreat, which typically lasts around two weeks, top leaders reduce their public appearances while engaging in informal discussions on key policy and personnel matters. Security in the area has been heightened, with a ban on drones and other low-altitude aircraft in effect for July and August.</p>

This approach could involve risky military operations in areas where hostages are believed to be held by Hamas. The families' forum called this strategy a "fraud" and an "illusion," stating that Netanyahu is leading both Israel and the hostages toward devastation. This comes after Hamas and Islamic Jihad released harrowing videos showing hostages in visibly poor and emaciated condition.</p>

          <p>India's information technology sector, a major engine of economic growth, is currently experiencing significant job cuts, raising concerns about its future. Tata Consultancy Services, the country's largest IT employer, announced over 12,000 layoffs, attributing them to skill mismatches and limited deployment opportunities. While a slowdown in global demand is a key factor, analysts are also examining the disruptive impact of artificial intelligence, which is automating routine tasks and transforming job roles. This trend poses a major challenge for India, which needs to create millions of jobs annually for its large pool of engineering graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a commentary for The Guardian, Timothy Garton Ash argues that the Democratic party and liberal media were too slow to acknowledge President Biden's declining fitness for a second term, a reality he claims was obvious to most Americans. He posits that a combination of fear of losing access, party tribalism, deference to the presidency, and worry about alternatives led the political establishment to ignore clear warning signs. The author contends that had Biden stepped aside in 2023, the world might have been spared the current political situation, and urges the party to learn from this failure by listening to voters and empowering a new generation of leaders.</p>

Amorim has introduced a more relaxed environment and new tactical approaches, including a fluid three-man defense and more intense, disguised fitness drills. While the sports science team is reportedly pleased with the players' condition, the manager knows that results are the ultimate measure of success. The team shows potential improvements, but weaknesses in midfield remain, and the upcoming Premier League season will be the true test of this new direction.</p>

In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to use a legal opinion to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return.
