          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned from her position as a government whip due to disagreements over the government's plans to cut disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill, but she believes that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit are not the right approach. She stated that she had hoped to influence changes from within the government, but it became clear that her desired changes would not be implemented. A government spokesman responded that the reforms aim to fix a broken welfare system and support those who can and want to work, while protecting those with severe disabilities. </p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, also known as "razor blade throat," has been detected in several U.S. states and is currently the second most dominant variant in the country. The variant, derived from the omicron variant, appears to be more transmissible due to changes in the spike protein, which allows it to attach more easily to cells. While some experts report a painful sore throat is a common symptom, it is not yet confirmed if it is a definitive symptom of this variant. Health officials recommend staying up to date on vaccinations, practicing good hygiene, and considering wearing masks in crowded areas to protect against the virus. </p>

She also recalled struggling to land roles early in her career, attributing the difficulty to her multiracial heritage.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite President Trump's initial confidence in leveraging geopolitical capital, he has encountered strategic quagmires. The article contrasts Trump's approach with Ukraine's successful drone attacks within Russia, which shifted the strategic initiative. Trump's promises of deals with Russia and Iran have not materialized into concrete gains, and tensions have escalated in traditional conflict zones. The author suggests that having resources is different from skillfully utilizing them, and Trump's policies may inadvertently strengthen rivals like Russia and China. </p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that a passing star could cause instability in the solar system, potentially flinging Earth out of orbit or into the sun. Simulations indicate that passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. The gravitational tug from these stars could destabilize objects like Pluto and increase the risk of collision or ejection for planets like Mercury, Mars, and Earth. While the probability of a collision with Earth is low, it is higher than previously estimated. </p>

          <p>"28 Years Later," directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, is a compelling film that is both shocking and moving. The film adopts a more ambitious position than the original, extending its geographic coverage and placing viewers in a supposedly idyllic rural community that serves as a refuge. The movie becomes a sort of road movie that adopts different styles and techniques, following the family of Jamie, Isla, and their son Spike. The movie's visual style, filmed largely with iPhones 15 Pro Max, keeps the audience engaged. </p>

Israel's decision to escalate its military operation comes after an Iranian missile reportedly struck a major hospital in the southern city of Beersheba.

          <p>A private jet crashed in San Diego, killing all six on board, after flying too low and hitting power lines. The plane reached a descent point about three miles from the runway that was too low, before dropping to 60 feet above ground level. The victims included rock drummer Daniel Williams, music agent Dave Shapiro, and several others. The automated system that provides weather conditions and runway lights weren’t operating at the airport before the plane crashed. </p>
