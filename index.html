          <p>While some major tech companies are reassessing their data center projects, the overall AI data center market remains strong, driven by accelerated AI deployments. Companies like Amazon and Nvidia have reaffirmed the continued high demand for data centers. Strategic reallocations are occurring due to scarcity of resources like power, fiber, water, and land. The data center market is expected to grow significantly over the next few years, with variations in growth rate due to factors like tariff changes, with enterprise adoption driving long-term demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite previous setbacks, the onshore wind energy industry is experiencing a resurgence through the repowering of aging wind farms. Companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa are benefiting from the need to upgrade or replace older turbines with more efficient models. Repowering offers economic benefits such as avoiding property acquisition and increasing electricity output, even though new permitting processes may pose limitations. This trend is also boosting the turbine recycling industry, addressing environmental concerns and creating new business opportunities, though tariffs may impact costs.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Cory Booker staged a sit-in protest on the Capitol steps to voice their opposition to the Republican budget plan. They criticized potential cuts to Medicaid and framed the budget as harmful to the American people. The protest aimed to draw attention to the upcoming congressional vote on the budget, which is crucial for enacting President Trump's agenda. The budget reconciliation process allows Republicans to potentially pass the legislation without bipartisan support, which is why Democrats are protesting it so strongly.</p>
