          <p>President Trump stated that Apple will face tariffs of 25% or more on iPhones sold in the U.S. if they are not manufactured domestically. This is a push for Apple to move its production from countries like China and India back to the United States. Shares of Apple experienced a dip following the announcement. Analysts estimate that producing iPhones in the U.S. could significantly raise the price of the devices, with some suggesting the cost could reach as high as $3,500 per unit. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by allegedly showing indifference to harassment of Jewish students since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights stated that Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish acts of vandalism. Columbia University responded by stating its deep commitment to combating antisemitism and its intention to work with the government to address these issues. This action follows previous measures by the Trump administration, including the cancellation of grants to Columbia due to inaction on antisemitism. </p>

Netanyahu asserts that these leaders are on the wrong side of history and humanity by criticizing Israel's war conduct.

          <p>A protracted slump in crude prices has ramped up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to allocate cash to shareholders. Western energy supermajors have long sought to return cash to investors through buyback programs and dividends to keep their shareholders happy. Some analysts, however, are less convinced about Big Oil's pledge to return ever-higher shareholder returns, citing already stretched balance sheets and a sharp drop in crude prices. Recent market volatility has left the energy majors with "few economically attractive options" that allow for reinvestment while maintaining a competitive capital returns framework.

If completed, the exchange would be the largest prisoner swap of the war to date and could help build trust between two nations that have thus far been locked in unsuccessful negotiations for a temporary cease-fire. While Kyiv and Washington have pushed for an unconditional 30-day truce, Moscow has resisted, saying that any cease-fire must be preceded by Ukraineâ€™s withdrawal from territories that Ukraine still controls â€” a nonstarter for the Ukrainian authorities.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in June will be a significant step in bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba aims to secure the removal of higher U.S. tariffs and rejects settling for any reduction of import duties. The chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to hold another round of ministerial talks in Washington to urge the United States to reconsider its tariff policy. The premier also addressed how his minority government plans to tackle surging rice prices amid criticism that its perceived lack of urgency has contributed to sluggish public support for his Cabinet.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., impacting millions of foreigners, particularly Latin Americans. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the plan, arguing against double taxation. The measure, intended to curb illegal migration, could significantly reduce money flows to Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts warn of unintended consequences, such as a shift to informal remittance channels, and the risk of alienating Latino voters.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how, five years after George Floydâ€™s murder, despite states and cities enacting new policies aimed at improving policing, data suggests these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. The article also details how killings by police officers have risen from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article also discusses topics such as Trump targeting Harvard, Republicans passing their partyâ€™s sweeping domestic agenda bill, a fatal shooting in Washington D.C., and children's health.</p>

          <p>A sweeping tax bill passed by House Republicans disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans while worsening financial situations for low-income households. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bottom tenth of households would see a 2% income decrease in 2027 and 4% in 2033, while the top 10% would see a 4% income boost in 2027 and 2% in 2033. The bill's tax cuts are partially offset by reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Economists argue the legislation compounds the regressive nature of recent tariff policies.</p>
