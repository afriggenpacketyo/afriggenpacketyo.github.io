          <p>Authorities have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, stating that he likely died in the explosion. According to the FBI, Bartkus held nihilistic views and intentionally targeted the IVF facility, attempting to livestream the event. The bombing, described as the largest in Southern California, injured four others and caused significant damage, with the blast radius extending over 250 feet. Officials have confirmed that all embryos stored at the clinic were secured, and there is no ongoing threat to the public.

          <p>Poland held a pivotal presidential election on Sunday, with early exit polls indicating that pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski is narrowly ahead of nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki.

Meanwhile, Nawrocki, supported by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, presents himself as a defender of conservative values and national sovereignty.

The Trump administration issued an executive order claiming the clause was never intended to apply to these children.

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy criticized Donald Trump's acceptance of a $400 million Boeing jet from Qatar as "the definition of corruption," while other senior Republicans expressed concerns over the gift. Murphy argued that Trump's trip to Gulf states was motivated by personal financial gain rather than national security interests. Rand Paul said the gift gives the appearance of a conflict of interest, and Mike Pence noted Qatar's history of supporting terrorism. Trump insisted the gift was to the U.S., not personally for him, but critics argue the plane will primarily benefit Trump after he leaves office.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster, director of "Hereditary" and "Midsommar," is competing at Cannes for the first time with "Eddington," a thriller set in a New Mexican town dealing with pandemic anxieties. The film has divided opinions at Cannes, with some praising its exploration of American fear and others criticizing its sociopolitical material. Aster discusses his desire to make a film about what it feels like to live in a world where nobody agrees about what is happening. He describes the film as a horror film about free-floating political anxiety and the feeling of powerlessness in the face of despair.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists warn against the common habit of leaving razors in the shower due to the moist environment being a breeding ground for bacteria. The combination of oxygen and moisture causes razor blades to rust faster, increasing the risk of nicks and cuts. Bacteria found on wet razor handles can irritate the skin and cause infections. Dermatologists recommend rinsing the razor thoroughly, drying it with a towel, and storing it in a dry place outside the bathroom to keep the blades sharper and reduce skin issues. Additionally, after-shave lotion and moisturizer are advised to prevent skin infections.</p>

This shift has raised concerns in Israel, with some viewing it as a sign of declining influence for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the U.S. continues to support Israel, Trump's focus on Gulf nations and deals with Iran and Syria marks a departure from traditional U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>Student loan borrowers are bracing for wage garnishment as the Trump administration resumes collection activity on defaulted federal student loans. Borrowers may have up to 15% of their wages garnished. The consequences of this are severe and can be devastating to some. More than 5 million student loan borrowers are currently in default. A teacher in Virginia, for example, is afraid that the U.S. Department of Education will soon garnish up to 15% of his wages because he's behind on his student debt payments.
