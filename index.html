          <p>Kohl's Corporation has terminated CEO Ashley Buchanan after an investigation revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest with a vendor, leading to financial transactions and a consulting agreement involving an individual with whom he had a personal relationship.

          <p>A federal health report declares a lack of scientific evidence for hormonal and surgical treatments for young people with gender dysphoria, prioritizing psychotherapy instead. The report, commissioned following an executive order, expresses concerns about long-term harms from medical interventions, questioning the notion of gender identity differing from sex at birth. Transgender rights advocates criticize the report as ideologically driven, misrepresenting medical consensus. The report relies on analysis of existing studies, concluding uncertain benefits and definite harms like loss of fertility, leading to criticism of American medical groups for allegedly fostering intolerant work environments.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking dismissal of the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and other alleged violations. They argue that the concurrent state and federal prosecutions infringe on Mangione's constitutional rights. The attorneys also challenge the terrorism upgrade, asserting a lack of evidence to prove Mangione intended to intimidate a civilian population or influence government policies. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that could result in the death penalty, and his attorneys seek to suppress statements made during his arrest.</p>

Following a report on poor care at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, almost £100m was invested annually to improve maternity safety, but recent changes mean only £2m is guaranteed for maternity care this year. Campaigners and the Royal College of Midwives have condemned the decision, fearing it will undermine efforts to improve maternity safety and potentially lead to budget cuts.

          <p>The driver who crashed into a building housing an after-school program in Chatham, Illinois, killing four, was not intoxicated, according to Illinois State Police. Initial toxicology results for 44-year-old Marianne Akers were negative for alcohol and controlled substances. Police are investigating the possibility of a medical emergency leading up to the crash. The four girls killed were identified, and six additional children were injured. Flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff in honor of the victims, and the investigation remains active.</p>

          <p>Migrant crossings at the U.S. southern border remain at historically low levels three months into President Trump's immigration crackdown. Border Patrol recorded roughly 8,400 apprehensions in April, slightly higher than March but consistent with February. This represents a significant change compared to the high influx under the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes the drop to its policies, including rapid deportations and troop deployments. While some criticize these policies as inhumane, others note the impact on migration patterns.</p>

          <p>Dozens of homeless people living in a national forest in central Oregon were evicted by the U.S. Forest Service, citing a wildfire prevention project. The project involves removing trees and setting controlled burns, and authorities closed the area for safety. Homeless advocates criticized the timing, linking it to the Trump administration's push for increased timber production. A judge denied a restraining order to stop the closure, stating the public's interest in forest restoration outweighs the residents' interest in residing there. The U.S. Forest Service aims for voluntary compliance but will enforce the closure.</p>
