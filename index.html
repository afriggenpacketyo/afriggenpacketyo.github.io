          <h2>Nationalist Simion Advances to Runoff in Romanian Presidential Election</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 02:43:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing nationalist George Simion secured a commanding lead in the first round of Romania's presidential election, campaigning against military support for Ukraine and expressing skepticism towards the EU. Simion's victory is viewed with concern in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance as a transit route for weapons to Ukraine and its hosting of a US missile defense shield. Despite his campaign rhetoric, Simion stated that Russia poses the biggest danger to Romania, Poland, and the Baltic states, and expressed hope for peace talks. His rise reflects public resentment towards financial support for Ukrainian refugees and frustration with Romania's outgoing president. The upcoming runoff election on May 18 is poised to significantly impact Romania's foreign policy and its relationship with key international players.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has taken a more assertive public role, increasing tensions between Pakistan and India. General Munir's tough rhetoric, including describing Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein," reflects his hard-line stance on India and his belief that the conflict has religious underpinnings. His comments have been interpreted by many in India as a significant shift in Pakistan's approach. The United States and the United Nations have urged de-escalation, but with India's Prime Minister Modi vowing to pursue terrorists, the risk of miscalculation and broader conflict remains high. The article highlights General Munir's past involvement in regional crises and his focus on consolidating military control over Pakistani politics.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that these policies violate the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and have allowed criminal elements, such as the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, to operate within the state. Colorado officials have denied being a sanctuary state, stating that they regularly cooperate with federal law enforcement. The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to pressure Democratic-led cities to comply with federal immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing a national security threat and claiming the American movie industry is in decline. He attributes this decline to foreign countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers and studios. The details of the proposed tariff are unclear, including whether it would apply to American production companies filming abroad or films on streaming services. Other countries like Australia and New Zealand have expressed their support for their respective film industries in light of this announcement.</p>

The suspension is attributed to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed rail networks increasingly replace air travel for cheaper transportation options.

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that doing nothing to reform social care for older and disabled adults is an "untenable" decision. The report emphasizes that the failure to fix England's social care system is costing the country financially and in human terms. The committee also highlighted a lack of available data into the system, and called for the government to publish annual assessments of the level of unmet care needs for adults, as well as an annual estimates into how much delayed discharges are costing the NHS. The government acknowledges the need for deep reform and is currently working on the issue.</p>
