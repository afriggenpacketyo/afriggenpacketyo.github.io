          <h2>Chipotle Lowers Annual Sales Forecast Amid Declining Customer Visits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 16:20:34 EDT</div>

          <p>Chipotle Mexican Grill has revised its same-store sales growth forecast for the year down to flat, a significant reduction from its previous low-single-digit projection. This adjustment follows a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with a 4.9% drop in visits contributing to a 4% decrease in same-store sales. While the company's overall revenue saw a slight increase due to new restaurant openings, the negative outlook and earnings miss caused its stock to fall sharply in extended trading. Executives attribute the slowdown to broader consumer concerns about the economy, leading people to dine out less frequently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tesla's Q2 Automotive Revenue Declines for Second Consecutive Quarter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has reported a 16% year-over-year decline in its automotive revenue, marking the second straight quarterly drop and missing Wall Street expectations. The company also saw a 14% slide in vehicle deliveries, attributed partly to a consumer backlash in the U.S. and Europe following CEO Elon Musk's political activities. Increased competition from other automakers, including affordable high-tech options from Chinese brands, and the postponement of a lower-cost "model 2" vehicle have also contributed to the slump. Tesla's stock has underperformed this year compared to other major tech companies, reflecting these ongoing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Enterprise technology firm ServiceNow reported strong second-quarter financial results, surpassing analyst expectations for both earnings and revenue, which caused its shares to climb. The company's subscription revenues saw significant growth, hitting $3.11 billion, prompting an upward revision of its full-year guidance. CEO Bill McDermott credited the robust performance to widespread adoption of artificial intelligence, stating that AI is refactoring business processes across all industries. Despite some uncertainty in its federal business sector, the company remains confident in its outlook for the upcoming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan aimed at accelerating U.S. innovation in artificial intelligence while reducing regulatory obstacles. The plan outlines over 90 policy actions, including promoting the export of U.S. technology and reviewing federal policies that could hinder AI development. A key focus is on eliminating what the administration terms "ideological bias" from AI systems. While officials frame the initiative as crucial for competing with China, critics from groups like the AI Now Institute argue it prioritizes corporate interests over public welfare and dismantles important safety guardrails. </p>

          <p>A series of recent drowning fatalities, including the tragic death of 54-year-old actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner in Costa Rica, is raising awareness about the dangers of rip currents. Experts emphasize that these powerful, narrow channels of water moving away from shore cause the majority of rescues on surf beaches and are estimated to cause over 100 deaths annually in the U.S. Lifesaving professionals advise swimmers caught in a rip current to remain calm, float, and swim parallel to the shore to escape its pull before heading back to land. They also strongly recommend swimming near a lifeguard and using a flotation device if attempting to rescue someone else.</p>

          <p>Two federal judges have issued critical rulings in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. A Tennessee judge ordered his release from criminal custody pending trial, while a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining or deporting him upon release, requiring 72 hours' notice for any removal proceedings. This legal intervention follows Abrego Garcia's previous deportation to El Salvador, which the government acknowledged as an "administrative error." His lawyers praised the rulings as a necessary protection of his due process rights against what they term the government's "lawless conduct."</p>

          <p>Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, meeting for a third round of talks in Istanbul, have reportedly agreed to a significant prisoner of war exchange. According to a Russian negotiator, the agreement involves swapping 1,200 prisoners from each side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the return of over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs, including many who were severely ill or wounded. While the exchange marks a positive humanitarian development, the talks on broader peace terms were brief, with both sides acknowledging that their positions remain far apart. The discussions also touched on a potential temporary ceasefire and the logistics for a future presidential meeting.</p>

The project will record ownership of funds from asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity on Goldman's private blockchain platform. This innovation aims to bring greater efficiency to the $7.1 trillion money market industry by enabling faster, 24/7 settlement and reducing transactional friction. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for corporations and hedge funds to manage cash and potentially use as collateral in the future.

The 23-year-old, who scored 15 goals for the Bundesliga club last season, has passed his medical and will join the team on its pre-season tour. Ekitike's arrival is Liverpool's latest major acquisition in a busy summer transfer window, pushing their total spending past £250 million. Known for his versatility and tactical understanding, Ekitike successfully revived his career at Frankfurt after a challenging period at Paris St-Germain, becoming one of the German league's top offensive players.</p>

          <p>The opening day of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford was closely fought, with India finishing on 264-4 after being put in to bat. The tourists' efforts were hampered by an injury to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant, who retired hurt on 37 after being struck on the foot. England's captain Ben Stokes was a key performer, taking two crucial wickets, while recalled spinner Liam Dawson also made an impact. India's Sai Sudharsan scored a valuable 61, but his dismissal late in the day left the match evenly poised heading into day two, with England set to take the second new ball.</p>

          <p>According to former captain Michael Vaughan, veteran spinner Liam Dawson makes England a stronger and more balanced side. Playing in his first Test match in eight years, Dawson made an immediate impact by dismissing a key Indian batsman and providing crucial control with his bowling on the first day of the fourth Test. Despite being consistently overlooked for years, Dawson's all-around package, including his reliable bowling, solid fielding, and strong batting record in domestic cricket, is seen as a valuable asset. Dawson himself expressed that he didn't expect to play for England again and is focused on enjoying the opportunity.</p>

He argues that the center-left has become too passive, allowing a vocal, progressive minority to gain outsized influence, and must develop its own clear, affirmative agenda, particularly on affordability. Torres also reflects on his personal journey from public housing to Congress, the dangers of performative politics, and the radicalization of progressive views on foreign policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The discussion opens with a warning about the Trump administration's escalating attacks on press freedom.</p>

The protests, which have seen over 1,000 attendees, turned violent, resulting in injuries to eight officers and two hotel staff members, and leading to ten arrests.

Thimerosal, an ethylmercury-based preservative, has been the subject of anti-vaccine misinformation for decades, although scientific consensus finds no evidence of it causing harm. The move was criticized by some experts who argue it validates unfounded fears and could complicate global vaccine manufacturing and distribution, as the preservative helps prevent contamination in multi-dose vials.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes a lengthy interview with Hunter Biden, arguing that his candid, aggressive, and sometimes profane style could surprisingly resonate with voters that Democrats struggle to reach. Despite his controversial past, his temperament is described as MAGA-like, and his frank discussion of addiction and attacks on political figures could be seen as authentic in the modern media landscape. The author suggests that while Hunter's refusal to accept responsibility is a significant flaw, his ability to communicate directly and lean into controversy offers a lesson for Democratic politicians. The piece posits that a candidate with Hunter's communication style, but less personal baggage, could be highly effective.</p>

          <p>Republican-controlled states like Texas, Ohio, and Missouri are considering redrawing their congressional maps mid-decade, a move aimed at securing a larger GOP majority in the 2026 midterm elections. This unusual power play, encouraged by President Trump, is forcing Democrats to contemplate retaliatory gerrymandering in states they control. However, Democrats face significant obstacles, including independent redistricting commissions in key states like California and New York, state laws prohibiting such actions, and a lack of political will to bend established norms. The situation highlights a new, aggressive front in the battle for congressional control, potentially leading to a "race to the bottom" in electoral gamesmanship.</p>
