          <p>Major USDA cuts have severely impacted food banks and school food programs in North Carolina, leading to concerns about food access for vulnerable populations. The cuts, totaling over $1 billion nationally, have forced schools to reduce local food purchases and food banks to decrease aid distribution. Farmers are also affected, with reduced revenue impacting their ability to employ local workers. The loss of funding raises questions about how to address growing hunger crises and ensure access to essential resources for those in need. The situation underscores the critical role of federal support in sustaining local food systems and providing assistance to communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs faced a rollercoaster of court decisions, with an appeals court allowing the administration to continue collecting import fees after a lower court ruled that Trump had overstepped his power.

The legal battles over tariffs introduce uncertainty into the economic landscape, potentially impacting trade relations and business operations.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to continue collecting import taxes, suspending a lower court's ruling that deemed many of his global tariffs illegal. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly interfered with the president's authority over trade negotiations. The ruling stems from a challenge by small businesses and states, who argue that the tariffs, imposed on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, exceed presidential powers. The appeals court decision allows the tariffs to remain in effect while the case is litigated further.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the acclaimed documentary filmmaker known for his unflinching examinations of World War II and its aftermath, has died at the age of 97. Ophuls, who fled Nazi Germany as a child and spent his formative years in Los Angeles, directed the controversial film "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the myth of France's heroic resistance. He also won an Academy Award for "Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," documenting the crimes of the Gestapo chief in Lyon. His work was marked by a blend of humor, irony, and a deep commitment to exploring complex moral issues.</p>

This sentiment follows Washington and Beijingâ€™s agreement to reduce tariffs, signaling a potential shift in investment strategies towards Asian markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NASA scientists have discovered evidence of a process called "sputtering" that could explain the history of water loss on Mars. Using data from the MAVEN mission, researchers found that charged particles knock atoms out of the Martian atmosphere, contributing to its thinning. This sputtering effect helps explain why Mars lost its once-thick atmosphere, leading to the escape of liquid water into space. The findings provide insights into the conditions that may have made Mars inhabitable billions of years ago, helping to recreate the planet's past environment.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz responded to news of Elon Musk's exit from his government role with a humorous six-word statement: "finally rooting out waste and abuse." Musk had initially promised to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget but faced criticism for unlawful data access and employee firings. Walz's comment references the fact that Musk's position, the "Department of Government Efficiency," was initially created as a joke. This highlights the contrast between Musk's initial ambitions and the perceived outcome of his government involvement.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis reveals that Russia continues to generate billions from fossil fuel exports to the West, indirectly funding its war in Ukraine. Despite sanctions, Russia has earned significantly more from hydrocarbon sales than Ukraine has received in aid from its allies. The report highlights loopholes, such as the "refining loophole," where Russian oil is processed in third countries and then sold to sanctioning nations. Experts argue that stricter enforcement of sanctions, particularly the oil price cap, and a ban on Russian LNG imports to Europe are needed to curtail Russia's revenue stream.</p>
