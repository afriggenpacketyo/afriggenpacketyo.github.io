          <p>A massive Russian missile and drone attack struck Kyiv, resulting in at least nine fatalities and dozens of injuries, marking the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since last summer. Explosions echoed throughout the city as emergency responders sifted through the rubble of residential buildings in search of survivors, including a two-story apartment building hit directly by a missile. The Ukrainian President's chief of staff condemned the attack, emphasizing that Russia continues to target civilians and is not seeking peace. The attacks were described by Ukrainian authorities as further confirmation of Russia's continued aggression against the Ukrainian people.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have experienced a significant rally, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil and diminishing confidence in the U.S. dollar and Treasuries. Analysts attribute this shift to concerns over U.S. trade policy and geopolitical uncertainties, with gold's traditional role as an inflation hedge and its independence from any single nation's economic trajectory further boosting its appeal. Several analysts predict that gold prices will continue to rise, with some forecasting prices to reach $4,000 per ounce by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a major supplier to Nvidia, reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and operating profit due to strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. While the company credited AI's impact on the memory market for its first-quarter profits, it cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, have created demand volatility that will impact the second half of the year. SK Hynix expects Big Tech's spending on AI to continue driving memory demand, despite concerns about potential tariffs on semiconductor products.</p>

This proposal aims to provide victims with a greater sense of safety and freedom, contrasting with the current system where exclusion zones around victims' homes can feel restrictive to the victims themselves.
