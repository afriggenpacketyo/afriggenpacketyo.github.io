          <p>A whistleblower has alleged that the King County Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention in Washington state hired over 100 corrections officers who did not meet legal immigration requirements. The complaint, filed with the state's Criminal Justice Training Commission, claims individuals were hired with temporary or expired work visas, violating state law that requires officers to be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or DACA recipients. While the county disputes the number of guards and denies hiring any illegal immigrants, it acknowledged a potential oversight in applying state statutes and confirmed that four recent hires were expelled from training for not meeting eligibility requirements. An investigation by state and local officials is currently underway to determine the full scope of the issue.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has publicly called for the Trump administration to impeach "corrupt judges," a sentiment echoed by MAGA figures and Elon Musk. This comes as threats against U.S. judges are escalating, with 2025 on track to set a new record for threats investigated by the U.S. Marshals Service. Experts warn that this rhetoric, similar to tactics used by autocrats in Hungary and Turkey, aims to undermine judicial independence and intimidate judges into ruling in favor of the administration. Bukele's own actions, such as dismissing high-court justices in 2021, serve as a playbook for weakening democratic checks and balances through legalistic means.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, Florida's CFO and a Ron DeSantis loyalist, is leading an initiative to audit Democratic-run cities for alleged wasteful spending, a move critics describe as politically motivated. The effort has drawn controversy, notably after two armed officers were sent to the home of a retired veteran who sent Ingoglia a postcard stating, "You lack values." Officials in targeted areas like Broward County are pushing back, arguing Ingoglia's claims of waste are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded mandates from the state. Analysts suggest the campaign is less about fiscal responsibility and more about furthering a political agenda against Democratic strongholds and consolidating state power.</p>

          <p>Rangers Football Club is facing a crisis after their top managerial choice, Steven Gerrard, turned down an offer to return, citing that the timing was not right. Gerrard's rejection, reportedly linked to a reluctance to work under the club's new sporting director structure, has left the board scrambling for alternatives and exposed a lack of a clear backup plan. The club he left in 2021 is now fundamentally different, with new ownership and management, and operates under greater financial constraints than during his previous tenure. The public rejection has embarrassed the club and created uncertainty, with potential candidates like Danny Rohl now being considered in a high-stakes decision for the team's future.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has announced that its forces killed 58 Pakistani soldiers and captured 25 military posts during overnight operations along their shared border. These actions were described as a response to recent Pakistani airstrikes inside Afghanistan, which Islamabad has not claimed but which follow accusations that Kabul harbors anti-Pakistan militants. Pakistan has condemned the Afghan aggression, stating its army delivered a "befitting reply" and destroyed several Afghan posts. The escalating conflict has led to the closure of major border crossings, including Torkham and Chaman, deepening tensions and prompting calls for restraint from regional powers like Saudi Arabia.</p>

While Gen Z gravitates towards online shopping influenced by social media, older consumers appreciate in-person advantages like having sales associates order and ship out-of-stock items for free.

          <p>The wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of deceased pitcher Tyler Skaggs against the Los Angeles Angels is set for trial after settlement talks failed. The family alleges the team knew or should have known that former communications director Eric Kay was supplying players, including Skaggs, with illicit drugs. Skaggs died in 2019 from an overdose of fentanyl-laced pills provided by Kay, who is now serving a 22-year federal prison sentence for his role.

With a range of 2,500 km, these missiles could enable Ukraine to strike deep within Russian territory, including Moscow. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov highlighted that since some Tomahawk variants can carry nuclear warheads, their deployment would force Russia to react to any launch as a potential nuclear threat. This statement follows President Trump's recent comment that he has "sort of made a decision" on the matter, intensifying the confrontation between Russia and the West.</p>

Polls show broad, bipartisan public support for extending the subsidies, with over 75% of voters in favor. If Congress fails to act, enrollees could see their premiums double on average next year, and the Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people could become uninsured as a result.</p>

The piece contends that in an era where opponents readily break democratic conventions, the Democratic leadership's focus on restraint and compromise is a failing strategy.

          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are exploring the possibility of selling parts of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to private investors. This unprecedented move could transfer repayment and management responsibilities to private companies, raising concerns among experts about the potential loss of borrower protections, such as income-driven repayment plans and the possibility of future debt cancellation. Critics suggest the proposal is driven by a political desire to reduce the federal government's role in education and could prioritize investor profits over borrower welfare. The plan aligns with the administration's broader goal of increasing private-sector involvement in the student loan system. (not investment advice)</p>

By analyzing these complex characteristics, the team was able to identify an "underrated sequence basis" for how different species arrive at the same functional traits.

          <h2>Op-Ed Questions Free Speech Protections for Conversion Therapy Targeting Minors</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece explores the complex ethical and legal issues surrounding conversion therapy bans, as the Supreme Court hears the case of Chiles vs. Salazar. The author grapples with the tension between protecting the 1st Amendment rights of therapists and the states' interest in preventing harm to LGBTQ+ children. The article recounts harrowing stories from parents whose children were driven to despair and suicide after undergoing the discredited practice, which tells them their identity is a changeable flaw. While acknowledging the importance of free speech, the author concludes that a therapist's job is to guide a child toward self-acceptance, not to inflict psychological harm in the name of religious doctrine.</p>

          <p>China has defended its new export controls on rare earth minerals as a "legitimate" measure to safeguard national security, pushing back against U.S. accusations of economic coercion. The statement came after President Trump announced a retaliatory 100% tariff on Chinese goods and new export controls on critical software, causing stock markets to plunge. China's Commerce Ministry accused the U.S. of applying "double standards" with its own extensive export control list and stated it was "not afraid" of a trade war. The escalating rhetoric threatens to derail a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and reignite a damaging trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has warned that the global economy faces significant risks, urging policymakers to "buckle up" as "uncertainty is the new normal." Her comments were quickly followed by President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, which sent markets tumbling. This article argues that while the global economy has been resilient, it faces multiple menaces, including escalating trade wars, unfunded U.S. tax cuts, and a potentially unsustainable boom in AI-related stocks that echoes the dot-com bubble. These converging threats create a fragile environment, with the potential for a sharp market correction and widespread economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two of China's senior officials recently conducted tours focusing on key domestic priorities at opposite ends of the country. In the eastern province of Zhejiang, Vice-Premier Zhang Guoqing encouraged manufacturers to integrate new technologies like artificial intelligence and large language models into their production processes to cultivate "new quality productive forces." He emphasized supporting specialized firms to innovate in niche areas, such as all-solid-state batteries and optical instruments. This focus on technological advancement and industrial upgrading highlights a central pillar of Beijing's current economic strategy, alongside ongoing efforts to address poverty and public health in other regions.</p>

          <p>The strong rally in Chinese stocks seen throughout 2025 is now under threat due to the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. After President Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on Chinese goods, a gauge of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks plummeted over 6%, and American tech stocks like Nvidia also fell sharply. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which had climbed 31% this year on the back of a trade truce and optimism around AI, now faces significant pressure. The renewed uncertainty is expected to spook investors and could derail the market momentum that had been building after four consecutive years of losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is embarking on one of its most challenging and expensive infrastructure projects to date: a 1,980km railway connecting Xinjiang and Tibet. Dubbed a "project of the century," the line will traverse extremely difficult terrain, including high-altitude mountain ranges and permafrost zones, with an average elevation above 4,500 meters. The total investment could reach 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion), making it one of the costliest rail lines ever built in the country. A new state-owned company has been established to oversee its construction and operation, underscoring Beijing's commitment to enhancing connectivity and development in its strategic western regions.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the disgraced former frontman of the rock band Lostprophets, has died in prison following an assault. West Yorkshire Police confirmed the 48-year-old was pronounced dead at HMP Wakefield and have arrested two men on suspicion of murder. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence for a series of child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, which the sentencing judge described as plunging into "new depths of depravity." The incident occurs shortly after a report highlighted a marked increase in violence at the prison, with many inmates convicted of sexual offenses feeling unsafe.</p>

          <p>An influential elite army unit in Madagascar, known as CAPSAT, has announced it has taken control of the country's entire military command amid escalating anti-government protests. The move came shortly after President Andry Rajoelina's office declared that an illegal attempt to seize power by force was underway. The CAPSAT unit, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's own rise to power in a 2009 coup, had recently sided with protesters angry over corruption, high living costs, and police brutality. The confrontation signals a severe political crisis for the island nation, which has a long history of instability and popular uprisings.</p>
