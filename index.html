            <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 1,000 points, as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates, coupled with concerns about the impact of tariffs on economic activity, fueled market volatility. Legal experts maintain that Trump lacks the authority to directly fire Powell, whose term extends to 2026.</p>

The chat, which included Hegseth's wife and brother, allegedly contained details about air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. The White House maintains that no classified information was shared, attributing the reports to internal dissent within the Pentagon.
