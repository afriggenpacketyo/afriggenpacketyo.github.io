          <p>Donald Trump has nominated Casey Means, a leading voice in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America healthy again” movement, as the new surgeon general. Means has a history of promoting pseudoscience and making hyperbolic statements about health issues. She has also expressed skepticism about the public-health establishment and questioned the safety of childhood vaccines. Her appointment is seen as part of a broader trend of medical contrarians assuming top positions in federal health agencies.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state requiring clergy to report child abuse learned during confession has ignited a battle between the Catholic Church and the federal government. The law mandates clergy to report child abuse without exemptions for information disclosed during confession. The Archdiocese of Seattle has vowed to excommunicate priests who comply with the legislation, while the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation, calling the law "anti-Catholic." This situation raises questions about religious freedom and the protection of children.</p>

          <p>Several states, including Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, are attempting to reinstate Medicaid work requirements, causing anxiety among low-income Americans who rely on the program. Under the proposed rules, eligible adults would need to work to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Critics argue that these requirements are a tactic to reduce Medicaid enrollment and create hardship for vulnerable populations. Studies from Arkansas' previous attempt at implementing work requirements showed that many people lost coverage due to complicated reporting processes, not due to lack of employment.</p>
