        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole by a California board, 36 years after he and his brother Lyle murdered their parents. The decision was primarily based on his behavior in prison, including rules violations like drug smuggling and illegal cellphone use, rather than the severity of the original crime. The parole board commissioner stated Menendez continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety, though he will be eligible for another hearing in three years. This hearing was made possible after a judge resentenced the brothers under youth offender laws.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers to halt production of its H20 artificial intelligence chips, which were specifically designed for the Chinese market. This move follows reports that the Chinese government told local tech companies to stop purchasing the chips due to national security concerns, including fears of potential tracking technology or remote-access "backdoors." The situation highlights the significant challenges Nvidia faces in navigating the escalating technological tensions and shifting trade policies between the United States and China.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction effectively ordering the shutdown of a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling prohibits the transfer of any new detainees and halts all construction, citing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act. The judge agreed with a coalition of environmental groups that the Trump administration and Florida officials bypassed necessary reviews, risking irreparable harm to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, though it remained higher than economists' expectations. This marks the 40th consecutive month that inflation has stayed above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, intensifying the debate over whether the central bank should raise interest rates. A key factor in the slight cooldown was the easing of rice prices, which had previously surged to extreme levels earlier in the year, providing some relief to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Washington, D.C., to promote his administration's takeover of the city's law enforcement and crackdown on crime. During his remarks, Trump declared the effort a success and made an unusual promise to re-grass the city's parks to the standard of his own golf courses. The visit is part of a broader administration push that has involved deploying National Guard troops and federal agents to address what Trump has characterized as a severe crime problem in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart's U.S. division, expressed bewilderment over the company's stock price falling by 4.5% following the release of a very strong quarterly report. He noted that Walmart had raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust performance despite economic pressures and tariffs. Simon believes the market overreacted to a one-time expense that caused a technical earnings miss, overlooking the company's fundamental strengths and growing market position.

          <p>The international arms race for hypersonic missiles, which can travel at more than five times the speed of sound, is rapidly intensifying. This article details how China and Russia have established a significant lead in developing these advanced weapons, while the United States and its allies are now investing heavily to close the gap. The primary threat from hypersonic weapons stems from their extreme speed and maneuverability, which makes them incredibly difficult for current missile defense systems to detect, track, and intercept.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing its public pressure on the Federal Reserve, now calling for the removal of Governor Lisa Cook over unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. After Cook stated she would not be "bullied" into resigning, a senior administration official sent a letter urging Fed Chair Jerome Powell to remove her from the board. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's unprecedented campaign against the central bank's independence, as the Fed chair does not have the legal power to fire a governor.
