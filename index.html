          <p>The Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, and New York testified before a House Oversight Committee, defending their states' immigration policies amid ongoing protests in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement. The governors criticized President Trump's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles, with New York Governor Kathy Hochul calling it an "overreach of epic proportions" that undermines state sovereignty. Republicans on the committee questioned the governors about specific incidents involving undocumented immigrants committing crimes in their states, accusing them of prioritizing sanctuary state policies. The governors insisted that immigration enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the federal government and called for compassionate immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly increased inflation, with recent consumer and producer price readings remaining benign. Several factors are keeping inflation in check, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff implementation, the time lag for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months as pre-tariff stockpiles diminish and the tariffs are fully passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez apologized to the Spanish people after a corruption scandal involving a senior Socialist party colleague. SÃ¡nchez admitted he was wrong to trust Santos CerdÃ¡n, who has been asked to testify in court over alleged improper awarding of public contracts in exchange for kickbacks, and ruled out early elections. Opposition leader Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o called for SÃ¡nchez's resignation, stating that corruption is now the hallmark of the government. SÃ¡nchez pledged to restructure the leadership of his Socialist PSOE party and insisted his government would continue its political project.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani accused donors to opponent Andrew Cuomo of "blatant Islamophobia" after a mailer altered his image, darkening his beard. The mailer, aimed at Jewish voters, criticized Mamdani's views on Israel. Mamdani, who would be the first Muslim mayor of New York, linked the altered image to racism and suggested Cuomo's donors were afraid of losing the race. The New York mayoral race is being closely watched as a potential referendum on the future of the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A federal hearing is scheduled to address California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws. California Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they termed the "unnecessary" and "unlawful militarization." The Department of Justice argued that limiting the military to protecting federal buildings would amount to a "rioters' veto to enforcement of federal law."

          <p>Brian Wilson, the mastermind behind the Beach Boys, has died at age 82, leaving behind a legacy of meticulous sound design and collective feelings. His early work, like "Surfer Girl," demonstrated his singular control and veneration of collective emotions, and his album "Pet Sounds" is considered one of the greatest albums ever. Wilson's music explored themes of love, loss, and existential questions, and his struggles with mental health added a tragic resonance to his work.

          <h2>Dollar Slides to Three-Year Low as FTSE 100 Hits Record High</h2>

          <p>The dollar has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years, while the FTSE 100 reached a record high, driven by Donald Trump's trade threats and a weakening U.S. economy. The dollar's decline is attributed to expectations of earlier interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, prompting investors to favor the yen and euro. The FTSE 100's rally indicates a shift in global equity markets as investors diversify away from U.S. assets. Concerns about rising U.S. government debts and trade disputes are also contributing to the dollar's weakness. (not investment advice)</p>
