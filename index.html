          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests against federal immigration enforcement operations. The White House stated that this action aims to address lawlessness amidst demonstrations opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in California. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move as inflammatory, asserting that it would escalate tensions and that local law enforcement was already mobilized. The deployment comes after clashes between demonstrators and authorities during protests.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum concerning potential changes to citizenship and labor laws. The referendum, initiated by an NGO-led campaign, includes questions on reducing the residency time required for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 to 5 years, as well as worker protections against dismissal. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain from voting, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout. The center-left Democratic Party supports the referendum, viewing it as a way to better integrate second-generation Italians and improve worker rights.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance," where institutions preemptively cater to Donald Trump's agenda, and argues for a strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." Examples include universities censoring themselves and corporations reducing diversity programs to avoid Trump's ire. The author highlights instances where resistance is emerging, such as universities pushing back against government overreach and states challenging the administration's interpretation of civil rights law. The piece advocates for a multi-faceted approach, including mass demonstrations, consumer boycotts, and litigation, to restore democracy.</p>

          <p>The author contends that anti-Semitic attacks inadvertently strengthen the case for Zionism, as they underscore the need for a Jewish state. Recent attacks, such as the firebombing of a solidarity event for Israeli hostages and the execution of a couple outside a Jewish museum, are cited as examples. The piece argues that throughout history, anti-Semitism has driven Jews to seek refuge and self-determination in Israel. The author concludes that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on ensuring the safety and acceptance of Jews outside of Israel, but that the current movement often fuels the fears that underpin Zionism.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar spending package, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street. This provision would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreign entities with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Analysts warn that this "revenge tax" could have significant implications for the asset management industry and potentially limit foreign investment in the U.S. The Senate is currently assessing the bill and its potential impact.</p>

          <p>A top state regulator has warned that the booming US gambling industry has become a “highway without speed limits” and is calling for federal regulations on advertising and nationwide exclusion lists for problem gamblers.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision in *Ames v. Ohio* unanimously ruled that a heterosexual woman, Marlean Ames, could sue for discrimination after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a lesbian and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. The case, decided by Justice Jackson, highlights the central question in the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion: how much should the law treat a person as an individual rather than as a member of a group? The ruling underscores that discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal, regardless of whether the plaintiff is part of a historically disadvantaged group.</p>
