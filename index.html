          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell by over 9% on Tuesday, marking the fifth straight day of declines and a pullback of more than 15% from its recent all-time highs. This slump follows a period of rapid growth, where the stock had more than doubled in 2025, driven by strong AI enthusiasm and significant government contracts. Despite a landmark first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter, the company's valuation has become exceptionally high, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio soaring past 245. This valuation is significantly more expensive than established tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, which have much higher revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

The committee plans a thorough review to redact victim identification and any child sexual abuse material before making the records public. This move aims to increase transparency surrounding the case of the convicted sex offender, following controversy over a recent Justice Department review that found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail of prominent figures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's push for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, analysts suggest that any meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy is contingent on the Kremlin's stringent preconditions. Experts believe Putin is unlikely to engage in genuine diplomacy without significant concessions and may use the summit primarily as a theatrical display of Russia's global standing. While the White House is optimistic, analysts warn that Putin's strategy is to test Western resolve, though Russia's own faltering economy and battlefield supply issues could pressure him toward a ceasefire. The potential meeting is viewed as a significant shift, but not necessarily a breakthrough for peace.</p>

          <p>A large-scale manhunt is in progress for a suspect who stabbed a Colorado Parks and Wildlife ranger at Staunton State Park, located southwest of Denver. The incident occurred around noon on Tuesday, after which the suspect fled the scene on foot. The seasonal ranger was airlifted to a hospital and underwent surgery, where he is currently listed in serious condition. In response to the attack and the ongoing search involving heavily armed officers, authorities have closed the nearly 4,000-acre park and evacuated all visitors. The motive for the stabbing remains under investigation by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.</p>

          <p>An attack by gunmen on a mosque in Unguwan Mantau, a town in Nigeria's Katsina state, has resulted in the deaths of at least 13 people during morning prayers. Local authorities suggest the assault was likely a retaliatory act after residents and the Nigerian military had recently targeted members of the armed group. For years, criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have terrorized rural communities in northwestern and central Nigeria by raiding villages, kidnapping for ransom, and looting homes. The violence, which originated from land disputes, has evolved into organized crime, creating widespread insecurity in regions with a limited state presence.</p>

Data shows a significant rise in beverage offerings, especially cold drinks, with consumers now often visiting establishments solely for a beverage rather than as a food add-on. Companies are launching new product lines, from sweet Refreshers to protein-infused cold foams, to capitalize on this trend. This strategy is seen as a key opportunity for growth in a challenging consumer environment, as beverages often carry higher profit margins than food items and cater to demands for novelty and customization.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly broadened its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, extending them to encompass more than 400 additional product categories. Effective Monday, the expanded levies now apply to a wide range of derivative products, including machinery, fire extinguishers, construction materials, and specialty chemicals that contain steel or aluminum. The Commerce Department stated the move is intended to support American industries and prevent circumvention of existing tariffs. However, the complexity of the customs codes used to identify the new items has made it difficult to assess the full scope, which one expert estimates could affect at least $320 billion worth of imports.</p>

This environment is expected to benefit value-oriented retailers such as TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon, which are well-positioned to attract consumers looking to stretch their budgets. Meanwhile, other retailers face pressure on profit margins as they try to absorb costs rather than pass them on to shoppers. (not investment advice)</p>

However, S&P Global's analysis suggests the rise in tariff collections will help stabilize the nation's fiscal outlook. The ratings agency warned, however, that it could lower the rating in the future if deficits increase due to an inability to contain spending or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions.

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a strategic shift from the previous administration's policy of providing grants, with Lutnick stating, "we want a piece of the action." The statement follows reports that the Trump administration was considering taking a 10% stake in the chipmaker to support the reshoring of U.S. manufacturing. Intel, which has struggled recently and is slowing construction of its Ohio factory, is set to receive a nearly $8 billion grant from the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly used a Sheraton hotel in Louisiana to detain immigrants, a practice that appears to contradict a 2019 pledge by Sheraton's parent company, Marriott, not to allow its properties to be used as detention facilities. Evidence suggests the hotel, located near a major deportation hub, has been used to hold families and unaccompanied children. In 2019, amidst a previous immigration crackdown, Marriott had publicly stated it would decline any government requests to use its hotels for detention. It is unclear whether Marriott has a formal contract with ICE or was aware of the hotel's use for this purpose.</p>

According to the Department of Justice, Wen admitted that North Korean officials had wired him approximately $2 million to procure the contraband.

          <p>The Home Depot has maintained a largely silent and hands-off position regarding the increasing number of federal immigration raids targeting day laborers who gather near its stores. Despite the company's historical, albeit informal, connection to this workforce, executives have not addressed the issue publicly, including on recent earnings calls. The company has stated it is not notified of enforcement actions and instructs employees not to engage. Advocacy groups argue that Home Depot has a moral obligation to defend the day laborers, who are both customers and a crucial part of the ecosystem that serves the retailer's professional and DIY shoppers.</p>

          <p>After more than two years, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has ruled that a public university president's ban on drag shows is unconstitutional, affirming that the performances are protected by the First Amendment. The case arose after the president of West Texas A&M University canceled a planned student-led drag show, a decision initially upheld by controversial trial judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. While the ruling is a victory for free speech advocates, the lengthy delay in the justice system meant that many of the students involved graduated before their rights were affirmed, highlighting how judicial timelines can impact constitutional protections.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities have gained popularity for providing stable, lifelong income, they come with significant disadvantages that potential retirees should consider. High fees, including management charges and administrative costs, can erode returns over time, while steep surrender charges penalize early withdrawals, reducing financial flexibility. The complexity of annuity contracts often obscures the true costs and benefits, and fixed payouts are vulnerable to losing purchasing power due to inflation. Furthermore, annuities typically offer lower growth potential compared to stock market investments and carry credit risk, as they are backed by the insurer rather than FDIC-protected.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that tariffs on India will be increased for what he termed "profiteering" from the Ukraine war. As these geopolitical tensions rise, Apple is said to be ramping up operations at five Indian factories to prepare for its new iPhone 17 models. This shift is part of Apple's broader strategy to diversify its supply chain and reduce its manufacturing reliance on China.</p>

The report revealed that 63% of the 238 cars evaluated failed to meet the benchmark, with seven federal government ministers using vehicles that earned a "red card" for high emissions. The environmental organization criticized the government for its slow transition to sustainable transport, noting a preference for large, German-manufactured luxury gasoline and diesel cars over more efficient electric options.
