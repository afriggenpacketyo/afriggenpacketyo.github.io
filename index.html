          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed at least seven children of a Palestinian doctor, with two more missing and presumed dead. The doctor's husband and another child were injured in the attack, which occurred near a structure where car tires were stored, causing a fire that spread to the family's home. The Israeli military stated it targeted suspects near Israeli forces but is investigating whether uninvolved civilians were harmed. This incident is part of a renewed round of fighting between Israel and Hamas, amidst escalating airstrikes and threats of a major ground assault, contributing to the already immense civilian toll in Gaza.

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, the author introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' emphasizing emotional attunement, resilience, and open communication. This style balances clear boundaries with empathy, encouraging parents to accept their child's emotions without dismissal and view misbehavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents prioritize inner healing, take responsibility for conflicts, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The framework involves inner work, empathetic boundary setting, and preventing shame, fostering trust and connection between parent and child.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress in battling the Inn fire in Mono County near Yosemite National Park and Mammoth Mountain, increasing containment to 15%. The fire, which began on Thursday, prompted evacuations in Mono City and Lundy Canyon, but improved weather conditions allowed for the reopening of Highway 395 and the downgrading of evacuation orders to advisories. Containment efforts focused on clearing brush and establishing containment lines, with the aid of helicopters, engines, and hundreds of personnel. Officials anticipate mild weather in the coming days, urging visitors to exercise caution in the area due to ongoing firefighting operations.</p>

          <p>The BBC revisits the story of Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old baby in Gaza suffering from severe malnutrition due to an Israeli blockade and allergic reaction to regular milk formula. The article details the dire conditions in Khan Younis, where food and clean water are scarce, and many mothers are unable to breastfeed due to their own malnutrition. Siwar's mother, Najwa, struggles to find the special formula her baby needs, and the family lives in a shack amidst the ruins of war, constantly exposed to the sounds of conflict.

          <p>A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, objecting to the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Parsons criticized Trump's wearing of a Make America Great Again hat, viewing it as a blurring of the presidency and personal politics. He stated that West Point began censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology, which he saw as indoctrination rather than education. Parsons felt professionally compromised, unable to pursue important questions, and viewed the administration's actions as a dangerous intrusion of politics into education.</p>

          <p>Alex Palou secured his place in history by becoming the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, edging out Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marked by several unusual incidents, including a crash by Scott McLaughlin during warm-up laps and a pit road incident involving Alexander Rossi's car erupting in flames. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete 'the double' was cut short due to a three-car collision, preventing him from reaching the Coca-Cola 600 in time.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for unprecedented monetization of the presidency, with the Trump family profiting from various ventures, including cryptocurrency, real estate deals, and exclusive club memberships. Critics argue that these activities blur ethical lines and undermine instruments of accountability, as evidenced by Qatar's donation of a luxury jet for Mr. Trump's use and exclusive dinners for investors in his memecoin. Despite growing concerns and some public pushback, there has been limited official investigation or political blowback due to the administration's dismantling of ethical safeguards and a perceived normalization of corruption in Washington.

Ohtani threw 22 pitches to hitters, showcasing his full repertoire and reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball. The session was Ohtani's first time facing live hitters in a Dodger uniform, and he is expected to return to the rotation after the All-Star break.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, asserting that they have a "moral component" because able-bodied individuals who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." He argued that these requirements, which could impact his home state of Louisiana, promote dignity, self-worth, and community engagement among young men. Despite concerns that nearly 200,000 Louisianans could lose Medicaid coverage, Johnson insisted that the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but rather targets fraud, waste, and abuse. He also claimed some of those who are on Medicaid and SNAP are undocumented immigrants, although they are not eligible to receive food stamps or Medicaid.</p>

This proposal arose at a meeting where judges expressed worries about increasing threats following Trump's criticism of court rulings against his policies. Under the current system, the US marshals service, managed by the Justice Department, protects federal judges. The judges are contemplating whether Trump might instruct the marshals to withdraw security protection from a judge who ruled against him.</p>

          <p>Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebastião Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, has died at the age of 81 due to leukemia. Salgado's family said that through his camera lens, he fought tirelessly for a more just, humane, and ecological world. He contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Génesis project, and complications from this disease eventually led to severe leukemia. The Instituto Terra, which he and his wife founded, affirmed that Salgado's lens revealed the world and its contradictions, and his life brought the power of transformative action.</p>

          <p>Americans across the country are commemorating the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, with gatherings in Houston, where he grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was killed. The anniversary events include church services, vigils, and performances to honor Floyd and reflect on the racial justice movement that his death sparked. While many hailed Floyd's death as a catalyst for a national "reckoning" with racism, some observers note that the initial momentum for police reforms seems to be waning. In Minneapolis, community members planned a morning church service, a candlelight vigil and an evening gospel concert on Sunday to remember Floyd.</p>
