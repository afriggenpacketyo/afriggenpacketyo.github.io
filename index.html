          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China have concluded talks in Stockholm, agreeing in principle to extend a pause on tariff escalations. However, U.S. negotiators, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emphasized that any formal extension requires final approval from President Donald Trump. The current 90-day truce is set to expire on August 12, after which tariffs could revert to higher levels if no agreement is reached. The discussions did not cover the social media app TikTok, as officials stated they are keeping trade and national security matters separate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Danish pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk experienced a significant drop in its share price, falling by 23% after announcing key corporate changes. The company appointed veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar as its new CEO and simultaneously lowered its full-year sales and profit forecasts. This revision is attributed to weaker-than-expected U.S. sales growth for its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, and diabetes treatment, Ozempic. The company cited persistent competition from compounded versions of the drugs and a slower market expansion as primary factors for the reduced guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a suggestion from President Trump, Senator Josh Hawley has introduced legislation to send tariff rebate checks to American families. The proposed American Worker Rebate Act would provide payments of at least $600 per person, funded by revenue from the administration's import tariffs. While proponents argue it returns money to hardworking Americans, the idea faces skepticism from some fiscal conservatives concerned about the national deficit. Critics also warn that such rebates could exacerbate inflationary pressures, similar to stimulus checks issued during the pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

Supporters who expected a systematic implementation of an "America First" agenda have been frequently surprised by Trump's pragmatic or impulsive decisions on issues like immigration, foreign policy, and China. The author argues that unlike Reaganism, which was based on a coherent philosophy, "Trumpism" is more of a psychological phenomenon centered on loyalty to Trump himself. This dynamic suggests the movement's coherence is tied to his personality rather than a fixed set of policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a changing economic landscape, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account this August may still be a beneficial strategy for savers. While top CD rates are no longer at their peak, they remain competitive in the 4% to 4.5% range, offering a solid return on a significant deposit. With no Federal Reserve meeting in August, savers have a window of stability to lock in these rates before a potential rate cut in September. Given the high probability of a rate reduction this fall, this period could represent a final opportunity to secure a higher, fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor. The lawsuit alleged that the university permitted antisemitic discrimination during pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, where protesters allegedly blocked Jewish students from accessing parts of the campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will fund Jewish community support groups and a campus initiative to combat antisemitism. The university still faces a separate lawsuit from pro-Palestinian protesters who allege negligence during a violent counter-protest.</p>

Buttigieg contended that many government departments and programs were in need of reform even before 2024.

The case, brought by small businesses and 12 states, argues that the president exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs without congressional approval. Historically, IEEPA has not been used to justify tariffs, and a lower court initially ruled against the administration before the decision was stayed on appeal.
