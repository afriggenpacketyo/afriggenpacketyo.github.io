          <p>U.S. states are currently competing for a new $50 billion federal fund intended to support rural healthcare, a program created in response to anticipated Medicaid spending cuts under the Trump administration. However, federal officials are pushing for the funds to be used for innovative, transformative healthcare delivery models rather than simply backfilling hospital operating budgets. This has created tension between traditional hospitals seeking financial lifelines and newer, tech-focused companies proposing different approaches to rural care. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bradford Bulls are set for a return to the top flight of rugby league for the first time in 11 years, securing promotion to the Super League for the 2026 season. Their promotion comes after they were awarded a high Grade B status under the sport's new grading system, which evaluates clubs on both on-field and off-field performance. Consequently, the Salford Red Devils, who received a lower grade amid financial difficulties and a poor season, will be relegated from the expanded 14-team league.</p>

          <p>During a visit to the Middle East, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected diplomatic offer to Iran, suggesting a peace deal could be reached if Tehran ceases funding militant groups and recognizes Israel. The proposal was met with a cold reception in both Iran, where leaders cited recent U.S. aggression, and Israel, which remains deeply distrustful of the Iranian regime. Analysts suggest the gambit is unlikely to succeed and could instead escalate tensions, as Iran may feel compelled to bolster its military capabilities in response.</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating how to control programmed cell death by manipulating specific proteins that can trigger a self-destruct mechanism within cells. This process, involving structures called "death fold" polymers, is crucial for health but can be dysregulated in diseases like Alzheimer's, where brain cells die too early, and cancer, where harmful cells fail to die. Scientists hope to develop treatments that could prolong the life of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases or induce death in tumor cells by modulating this fundamental cellular process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced slight growth of 0.1% in August, primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in the manufacturing sector, according to the Office for National Statistics. However, the dominant services sector showed no growth, and economists maintain a weak outlook, anticipating that growth will remain sluggish in the coming months. With pressure mounting on the government ahead of the next Budget, analysts suggest that tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary to meet fiscal targets. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the damage, Ukrainian officials have assured citizens that residential gas prices will remain fixed, though the nation may need to secure additional, costly gas imports.</p>
