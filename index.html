The incident has fueled market fears about her potential replacement, with allies arguing it demonstrates her commitment to fiscal responsibility.

          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that Clayton Kershaw has solidified his status as the greatest pitcher in Dodgers history, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The author contends that while Koufax had an unparalleled five-year peak, Kershaw's 18 seasons of sustained excellence and longevity give him the definitive edge. The piece acknowledges Kershaw's postseason struggles but counters that his much larger sample size of playoff appearances makes direct comparisons difficult. Ultimately, it posits that Kershaw's enduring presence and statistical dominance make him the franchise's most impactful pitcher.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's major tax and spending package is facing collapse after House Republican leaders failed to gather enough votes from their own party to begin debate on the legislation. A crucial procedural vote stalled as five Republicans, spanning from hardline conservatives to moderates, voted against advancing the bill. This opposition stems from dissatisfaction with changes made in the Senate version, particularly deeper cuts to Medicaid that worry moderates. The failure to pass the procedural rule prevents a final vote, jeopardizing the administration's goal of signing the bill into law by July 4.</p>

          <p>Recent close votes in the U.S. House of Representatives, such as the one on President Trump's domestic spending bill, highlight the possibility of a tie. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure automatically fails. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. This procedure was notably demonstrated in February 2024 during a vote to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary, which initially tied and only failed after a Republican switched their vote procedurally.</p>

          <p>A piece of a wing flap that fell from a Delta Air Lines jet was discovered in the driveway of a home in Raleigh, North Carolina. The part belonged to a Boeing 737 that had landed safely at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on a flight from Atlanta with 109 passengers and six crew. The missing component was noticed during a post-flight inspection of the aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the part's origin and has launched an investigation into the incident, while Delta stated it is fully cooperating with retrieval and investigative efforts.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire is burning uncontrollably in eastern Crete, forcing the evacuation of approximately 1,500 people from homes and tourist areas near the municipality of Ierapetra. The blaze, fanned by strong winds, has a front extending over six kilometers and is threatening infrastructure, with some homes already destroyed. Thick smoke has drastically reduced visibility and air quality, leading to road closures and health warnings. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by the rugged, forested terrain, and reinforcements are being sent to the island to help contain the fire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell resign immediately, escalating his long-running criticism of the central bank's policies. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. The call for resignation came after Powell suggested that the Fed would have already cut rates if not for the economic impact of Trump's tariff policies. Legally, a president's authority to remove a Fed chair is limited, and Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked.</p>

          <p>An official review has found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed because the city council provided heavily redacted evidence to the police. According to the inspectorate's report, some pages of material had only a few words visible, making it impossible to assess their value for two major operations. Manchester City Council stated that complex data-sharing rules necessitated the redactions to avoid jeopardizing potential prosecutions. Since the issue was identified, the police, council, and prosecutors have established a new, more efficient protocol for sharing unredacted information.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progestin for hormone therapy may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. Progestin is necessary for women with a uterus to prevent endometrial cancer, but this study suggests it may be the component linked to higher breast cancer risk. This research refines previous understandings and highlights the importance of personalized medical consultation.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have revealed key evidence that led to the arrest of Bryan Kohberger for the murder of four University of Idaho students. A crucial breakthrough came from a Q-tip retrieved from his parents' trash, which provided a familial DNA match to a sample found on a knife sheath left at the crime scene. Investigators also noted that Kohberger's car had been "meticulously cleaned" and his apartment was sparsely furnished, suggesting an attempt to eliminate evidence. Cell phone data also placed him in the area of the crime multiple times in the months leading up to the attack.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that Donald Trump secured 48% of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from his 36% share in 2020. Political experts suggest this shift is not necessarily an ideological move to the right but rather a turn towards populism driven by economic concerns and disillusionment with the Democratic party. Some analysts point to a backlash against permissive border policies from naturalized citizens, while others argue Democrats have failed to develop a compelling working-class agenda that resonates with the community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deny people who cross the southern border the ability to apply for asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss found that President Trump's executive order, which characterized the border situation as an "invasion," exceeded his legal authority. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor federal law allows the president to unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants statutes enacted by Congress. The ruling has been hailed by immigrant rights groups as a critical affirmation of existing asylum law.</p>

The evaluation comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, making independent verification of the damage more difficult.
