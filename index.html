          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper was unexpectedly eliminated from Wimbledon in the second round, losing to 36-year-old Croatian veteran Marin Cilic. Despite being a fourth seed and a favorite, the 23-year-old was defeated 6-4 6-3 1-6 6-4, continuing his struggle to advance past the second round at the All England Club. Draper expressed his deep disappointment with the loss, which he described as one of the toughest of his career. The match highlighted Cilic's impressive return to form after a serious knee injury, while Draper's hopes for a major run at his home Grand Slam were cut short.</p>

          <p>Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced her resignation from the Labour Party to establish a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was suspended from Labour last year, cited the party's failure to improve lives and the political establishment's stance on the conflict in Gaza as key reasons for her departure. The new party aims to challenge what she calls a "broken" Westminster system, focusing on issues like poverty and welfare. While Corbyn has hinted at such a move, he has not officially confirmed his direct involvement in the new venture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Trump's signature legislative package in a narrow 218-214 vote, sending the massive bill to his desk for signing. The legislation, which includes trillions in tax cuts and increased spending on immigration and defense, overcame internal Republican opposition after intense pressure from party leadership and the president himself. Democrats uniformly opposed the bill, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering a record-breaking eight-hour speech to condemn its deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid. The bill's passage marks a significant, albeit contentious, victory for the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries set a new record for the longest speech on the House floor, speaking for 8 hours and 44 minutes. His marathon address was a protest against the Republican-led tax and spending bill, which he condemned as an "immoral document." Jeffries used the extended time to criticize the legislation's cuts to healthcare and food aid, while also delaying the final vote. This act of political theater highlighted the deep partisan divide over the bill and gave Democrats a significant platform to voice their opposition, even though they could not ultimately prevent its passage.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on administrative leave amid an investigation into an unauthorized letter. The employees are accused of misusing their official titles and agency positions to sign a letter that allegedly misled the public about the EPA's activities. An agency spokesperson stated that the EPA has a "zero-tolerance policy" for career staff undermining the administration's agenda. This action follows the recent termination or reassignment of nearly 500 EPA employees and the elimination of the agency's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and Environmental Justice offices under Administrator Lee Zeldin.</p>

The new charges follow a toxicology report that found a combination of animal tranquilizer drugs, known as BAM, in her bone marrow. Authorities state that Morphew, an avid hunter, was the only private citizen in the area with access to these specific drugs. He was previously charged in 2021, but the case was dismissed. This significant development in the high-profile case, which began with Suzanne's disappearance on Mother's Day 2020, points to a potential trial.</p>

          <p>A new independent study estimates that over 80,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 2023 and January 2025, a figure substantially higher than official counts from the Gazan Ministry of Health. Led by war researcher Michael Spagat, the study involved direct household surveys in Gaza, providing a rare on-the-ground assessment independent of official ministry records. The research suggests that while the ministry's data is accurate, it likely underreports the total number of casualties, including both violent and non-violent war-related deaths.

In response, Azerbaijan cancelled all Russian cultural events and arrested two Russian journalists, escalating a diplomatic crisis. The situation is further complicated by the downing of an Azerbaijani plane over Russia last year, which killed 38 people.

          <p>A group of former senior diplomats is raising alarms over Secretary of State Marco Rubio's plan to overhaul the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL). The proposed reorganization would reportedly shutter most offices devoted to human rights and lay off a majority of its expert staff. Critics argue this move will dismantle critical infrastructure, undermine decades of bipartisan foreign policy, and signal a U.S. retreat from promoting human rights globally. They contend that this decision imperils global stability and contradicts Rubio's own past support for human rights initiatives.</p>

This follows previous settlements with Meta and X (formerly Twitter) where millions were paid to Trump's presidential-library fund. The lawsuit alleges illegal censorship, an argument critics find ironic given the administration's own actions against political opponents. The talks highlight a pattern of the president using the power of his office to pressure companies into settling legal disputes, regardless of the cases' original merits.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major legislative bill introduces several new tax breaks, but four of its most prominent provisions are only temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of his term in 2028. These include federal income tax exemptions for tipped income and overtime pay, a deduction for interest on new auto loans, and the creation of government-funded "Trump accounts" for children. While these measures fulfill key campaign promises, their temporary nature means their long-term impact is uncertain. This structure mirrors the 2017 tax cuts, which were also set to expire before this bill made them permanent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor John Leguizamo returns for a second season of his MSNBC docuseries, "Leguizamo Does America," which explores Latino communities and their contributions across the U.S. The new season arrives in a changed political landscape under the Trump administration, with Leguizamo describing the show as an "antidote" to the erasure and mistreatment of Latinos. Visiting cities like Philadelphia and San Antonio, the series aims to highlight the stories of everyday people making a difference. The show continues Leguizamo's long-standing effort to increase Latino visibility and historical representation in media as a form of cultural resistance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill," a massive legislative package that will now be signed into law. From an international perspective, the bill is notable for its sweeping changes, including making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent while slashing healthcare and food assistance for millions of low-income Americans. It also allocates hundreds of billions for defense and immigration enforcement, including mass deportations. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will significantly increase the national deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Signs That Credit Card Debt Requires Professional Help</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 14:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans find their debt growing beyond what a do-it-yourself payoff plan can handle. Financial experts point to several warning signs that indicate a need for professional help. These include consistently failing to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. When these situations arise, options like credit counseling, debt settlement programs, or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy may be necessary to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>
