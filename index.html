          <p>The search for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in 2007, has resumed in Praia da Luz, Portugal, focusing on abandoned buildings and wells. Portuguese and German authorities are collaborating on the search, concentrating on a 21 sq km site between where Madeleine went missing and where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, was staying. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for sexual assault and is a key figure in the ongoing investigation. The current search follows a previous one two years ago at a reservoir, where BrÃ¼ckner had been found to have taken photos and videos. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian sales during May, reaching a nearly 12-month high, driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. While Model Y sales soared, sales of the Model 3 declined, but overall deliveries in Australia increased substantially compared to April. Despite this positive performance, Tesla's year-to-date sales in Australia remain lower compared to the previous year, and global sales were down in the first quarter. While the Australian rebound is a positive sign, it does not yet indicate a broader global recovery for the company. </p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, an oiler named after the gay rights activist and Korean War veteran. The decision, made in line with President Trump's objective to "re-establish the warrior culture," has been met with criticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi and Gavin Newsom, who argue it undermines American values. The ship was originally named in 2016 to honor leaders who fought for civil and human rights. The renaming is part of a broader effort to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion from the Department of Defense. </p>

Cologne was heavily targeted by Allied forces during the war, resulting in frequent discoveries of unexploded ordnance.

The restrictions, seen as retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have overwhelmed China's Ministry of Commerce with export applications. Some companies have already been forced to cease production due to delays in obtaining necessary approvals. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China is working with the ministry to address the issue, but the situation remains challenging for European industries relying on these critical minerals. </p>

Critics fear the increased tariffs could disrupt steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased duties, maintaining its existing 25% tariff rate.

BBC research indicates that most reviews take years, causing additional distress for families and potentially hindering the prevention of future deaths. Families report that the review process is "hell on earth" and that the delays undermine the purpose of the reviews.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill," describing it as a "disgusting abomination." Musk stated that the bill would significantly increase the budget deficit and burden American citizens with unsustainable debt. Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Musk's sentiments, calling the bill an "abomination" due to its tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid for the impoverished. The White House defended the bill, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt reaffirming President Trump's support. </p>

          <p>Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of patients following heart operations at Castle Hill Hospital, an NHS hospital. Documents suggest that patients suffered avoidable harm, and death certificates failed to disclose the role of the procedure in their deaths. The hospital's TAVI mortality rate was reportedly three times higher than the UK average, a fact unknown to patients and their families. Concerns raised by hospital staff prompted multiple reviews, but none were made public until the BBC contacted the families. </p>

          <p>More than 15 former Indiana men's basketball players have alleged improper sexual conduct by a former team physician, Dr. Bradford Bomba, claiming that university officials, including coach Bobby Knight, were aware of the behavior. The players allege that Bomba regularly performed unnecessary rectal exams and that their complaints were dismissed. While the university commissioned an investigation that found Bomba's exams were performed appropriately, some players contradict this finding. The allegations have led to legal action and scrutiny of the university's handling of the situation. </p>
