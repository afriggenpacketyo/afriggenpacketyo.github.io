          <p>Newly released police documents detail Bryan Kohberger's first interview after the Idaho student murders. Kohberger, who remained calm, discussed his criminology Ph.D. program and then inquired about his parents and dog before invoking his Fifth Amendment rights when pressed on the killings. He acknowledged receiving a crime alert but deflected direct questions about the incident. The interview offers insight into the killer's demeanor and initial interactions with law enforcement following the tragic events.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated he ended his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein years ago because Epstein repeatedly "stole" his employees. Speaking in Scotland, Trump claimed Epstein poached staff even after being warned, leading to him becoming "persona non grata" at Mar-a-Lago. This explanation comes amidst renewed questions about their past relationship and the release of investigative files related to Epstein, who died by suicide while facing child sex trafficking charges. Trump expressed satisfaction with his decision to distance himself from Epstein.</p>

          <p>The trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash," the third installment in James Cameron's series, introduces the Mangkwan Clan, or Ash People, led by the fiery Varang. This new tribe, inhabiting an ashen landscape, appears to be an adversary to Neytiri and her family, signaling a thematic shift from the water-focused "Way of Water." The film also teases Jake Sully's capture by humans and the introduction of the nomadic Wind Traders. Cameron hinted at a more nuanced narrative, moving beyond a simplistic "humans bad, Na'vi good" paradigm, with the movie set to release on December 19.</p>

Participants viewing sick-looking avatars showed increased activity in innate lymphoid cells, a type of immune cell crucial for early infection response.

The BMA maintains patient safety is paramount but attributes the need for derogations to poor planning and the push for non-urgent care during the ongoing pay dispute.

          <p>As homeowners consider tapping into their record-high home equity amidst shifting market conditions, experts offer differing advice on whether a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is preferable this August. Some recommend fixed-rate home equity loans for predictability given elevated interest rates, while others lean towards HELOCs, anticipating potential rate cuts. The choice ultimately depends on the borrower's financial situation, intended use of funds, risk tolerance, and interest rate expectations. Both options offer competitive rates compared to unsecured loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has prompted industry speculation about the future of traditional late night television. While some view it as a one-off financial move related to Paramount's merger, others see it as a sign of broader decline due to rising production costs and shrinking advertising revenue in a streaming-centric landscape. The article highlights the financial pressures facing these shows, with most operating at a loss based on traditional TV advertising, raising concerns for other long-running programs like "Jimmy Kimmel Live."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by economists Edward Glaeser and Joe Gyourko suggests that America's fastest-growing Sunbelt suburbs, once known for housing affordability, are becoming increasingly expensive. Despite population growth, housing supply has plummeted since the early 2000s, leading to surging costs. The research indicates that restrictive zoning laws, which limit density and prevent adaptation, are stifling growth in these desirable areas, mirroring patterns seen in coastal cities decades ago. This trend challenges the traditional suburban model and necessitates a fundamental rethinking of housing policy to address a national shortage.</p>
