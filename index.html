        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite new travel restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, certain individuals, including World Cup players, dual citizens, and those with existing visas, are exempt from the ban. The proclamation, citing national security interests, restricts travel from several countries, but these exceptions allow for continued participation in international events and travel for individuals already vetted or holding specific statuses. This decision reflects a balance between security concerns and the need to maintain international cooperation and facilitate global events. The exemptions are intended to minimize disruption while still addressing potential security risks.</p>

          <p>Japanese police investigated a record number of stalking cases in 2024, exceeding 1,300 incidents, marking the highest figure since the enactment of the anti-stalking law in 2000. This increase prompted the National Police Agency to enhance collaboration between prefectural headquarters and local stations to improve response to complaints. The heightened emphasis on stalking issues followed the tragic death of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner. The data also revealed a record number of restraining orders issued and a significant number of stalking-related crimes investigated under the Penal Code, indicating a persistent and evolving challenge for law enforcement and public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 and 2019 Boeing 737 Max crashes has denounced the deal between Boeing and the U.S. Justice Department as "morally repugnant," arguing it allows the company to evade genuine criminal accountability. Boeing agreed to pay $1.1 billion to avoid prosecution for the crashes that killed 346 people, with a portion allocated to families and compliance improvements. Critics argue the payout is insufficient, likening it to a minor penalty for the aviation giant. The deal, which requires approval from a federal judge, aims to settle fraud charges related to concealing information from safety officials about the 737 Max design.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Renewables First, a Pakistani think tank, highlights how the influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants in Pakistan, creating stranded assets. Pakistan has become a major destination for Chinese solar panels due to a zero tax rate on imports. This transition to decentralized solar power is causing a strategic contradiction, where China's solar panels are outcompeting China's power plants. The report raises questions about the long-term economic implications and the need for a balanced energy transition strategy in the Global South. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy, the Trump administration's tariffs disrupt the global trading system and undermine international relations. Raising tariffs weakens economic links and disregards free trade agreements, harming consumers worldwide through higher prices and limited choices. This retreat from free trade could lead to political discontent and a surge of migrants from low-income countries. Business interests that once kept relationships between rivals stable are now shifting, potentially deepening geopolitical fissures, which makes the world a poorer and more perilous place.

          <p>The Japanese government is focusing on encouraging domestic tourism to revitalize regional areas, as inbound visitors outpace local travelers. The Japan Tourism Agency's annual white paper reveals that domestic trips have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, despite a record number of foreign tourists. The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that emphasizes engagement between travelers and local communities, aiming to foster repeat visits and a sense of belonging. Initiatives include facilitating opportunities for interaction and removing barriers to travel, such as reluctance to take time off work, which will ultimately help rejuvenate Japan's domestic tourism sector.</p>

The investigation aims to determine if Biden's advisors unconstitutionally wielded presidential power by using the autopen to conceal his incapacity.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a top Russian security official that Pyongyang will "unconditionally support" Moscow's foreign policy, including its war in Ukraine, and further solidify the bilateral partnership. During the meeting in Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu expressed gratitude for North Korean soldiers' participation in operations to liberate the Kursk region. Moscow and Pyongyang have been increasing military cooperation recently, with North Korea sending troops to aid Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, presumably in exchange for technical assistance for the development of its military capabilities.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups by granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County’s coastline. The order halts restart efforts on the operation’s onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The ruling celebrates environmental groups and plaintiffs who argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. Sable officials said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the decision would force them to push back their restart timeline.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado temporarily blocked federal immigration officials from removing the wife and five children of the man charged in Sunday's attack in Boulder from the country or the state. U.S. District Judge Gordon Gallagher issued brief relief to Hayem El Gamal, the wife of Mohamed Soliman, and their children in order to preserve the court's jurisdiction over the case. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had taken into custody Soliman's wife and children and said they were being processed for removal proceedings from the U.S.</p>
