        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine has secured three Patriot air defense systems, with funding for seven more being sought. This comes as part of a deal allowing European nations to purchase and transfer U.S. weaponry to Kyiv, a shift in policy under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul have shown little progress, with Russia stating a potential meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin would only occur in a "final phase" of negotiations. The discussions remain stalled due to fundamentally different positions on ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Three Venezuelan men, deported from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act, have alleged experiencing severe physical and psychological abuse at El Salvador's CECOT prison. They were sent there after being accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, a claim they deny. The men recount being beaten, humiliated, and denied legal access before their eventual release in a prisoner swap. The Department of Homeland Security defended the decision to send them to the high-security prison, stating they posed a threat to Americans.</p>

          <p>Mhairi Black, the former deputy leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, has announced her departure from the party. She cited significant disagreements with the party's direction, particularly its "capitulation" on trans rights and its stance on the conflict in Palestine. Black, who became the UK's youngest MP in 2015 before stepping down last year, stated she remains pro-independence but feels the SNP needs to change and adopt more left-wing policies. The SNP responded by emphasizing unity under its current leadership.</p>

          <p>Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) in Kentucky is instituting a district-wide cellphone ban for the upcoming school year, extending beyond state requirements to cover the entire school day. The policy, approved by the board of education, aims to reduce classroom distractions, curb cyberbullying, and improve student focus and academic achievement. Individual schools will determine their own enforcement methods, with some, like Fern Creek High School, using locking pouches which has reportedly led to increased student social interaction. Parents can contact their children through the school's front office.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors has strongly urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its most stringent "black box" warning labels from low-dose estrogen treatments for menopause. They argue the current warnings, which list risks like cancer and dementia, are unsupported by modern science for these specific local therapies and unnecessarily scare women away from beneficial treatments. This debate reflects a significant shift from two decades ago when a major study linked hormone therapy to higher health risks. Critics of the move, however, call the panel "theater" and worry the FDA is bypassing its usual rigorous scientific evaluation process.</p>

          <p>Pediatricians across the U.S. are reporting increased anxiety from parents about the future availability and insurance coverage of routine childhood vaccines. This concern has been fueled by the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary and his subsequent replacement of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee (ACIP) members. Since the ACIP's recommendations determine which vaccines insurers must cover, any changes could force families to pay out-of-pocket, potentially lowering vaccination rates.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to formally recognize a Palestinian state, following France's recent commitment to do so. A parliamentary foreign affairs committee report, supported by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs, argued that recognition is an "inalienable right" and should not be conditional. However, Conservative members dissented, aligning with the government's official stance that recognition should be part of a long-term two-state solution. Starmer has reiterated that statehood is a right but maintains recognition should be timed for when it can have the "greatest impact."</p>

Investors are now beginning to question the long-term stability of U.S. government debt, a significant shift in market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has lowered its full-year financial guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter profit, largely due to the impact of U.S. tariffs and restructuring costs. The company stated that tariffs cost it €1.3 billion in the first half of the year, forcing it to reduce its expected operating return on sales. The results reflect broader challenges facing European carmakers, including intense competition and trade disputes. This news comes as President Trump has threatened to increase duties on EU auto imports even further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The massive "Cum-Ex" and "Cum-Cum" tax fraud schemes, which involve complex share-trading to claim multiple refunds on a single tax payment, continue to cost Germany and other nations billions. Despite being exposed years ago, a legal loophole allows the practice to persist, with global losses estimated at over €140 billion. Former senior prosecutor Anne Brorhilker states that a chronic shortage of specialized investigators and intense lobbying from the financial industry have hindered effective prosecution and legislative fixes.

          <p>Taiwan is holding a mass recall vote targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, who are accused by pro-independence groups of being too close to Beijing. The vote is seen as a critical test of the "resist China, protect Taiwan" sentiment and could influence the island's political landscape ahead of future elections. The KMT has been critical of President Lai Ching-te's administration, which Beijing views as "separatist." The outcome of the recall could either strengthen the ruling DPP's hand or signal a shift in public mood regarding relations with mainland China.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is experiencing a surge in popularity, largely fueled by new stars like Caitlin Clark, but this growth has also intensified debates about the league's state. While fan and media attention on Clark is immense, player voting for the All-Star game ranked her ninth, reflecting a more critical internal view of her performance compared to established stars. The article examines several "truths and fictions," arguing the league is not overly dependent on Clark and that its emphasis on fundamentals is a strength. It also touches upon officiating standards, a common point of contention.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes rose by 0.9% in June, a rebound driven by a month of exceptionally hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. Supermarkets saw increased sales of drinks, and clothing retailers benefited as consumers refreshed their summer wardrobes. Fuel sales also increased as more people traveled in the sunshine. However, this rise follows a significant 2.8% drop in May, and the overall trend for the quarter shows that growth in retail spending has slowed, suggesting a potentially lackluster performance for the broader economy.</p>
