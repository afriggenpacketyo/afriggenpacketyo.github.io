        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners increasingly tap into their home equity amid firm interest rates, this article outlines several expensive errors to avoid. Key mistakes include choosing a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, as this can expose borrowers to future rate hikes. Another significant pitfall is borrowing more than necessary, which increases interest costs and financial risk if property values decline or personal income changes. The summary also warns against ignoring closing costs and hidden fees, advising borrowers to compare the full Annual Percentage Rate (APR) across different loan offers to understand the true cost of borrowing.

          <p>Amazon is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching the impact of U.S. tariff policies and the company's investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts are monitoring revenue from key divisions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising, which are expected to show continued growth. The company previously warned that tariffs could affect results, although some analysts believe Amazon has gained market share from Chinese competitors like Shein and Temu due to these same trade policies. Additionally, Wall Street will be looking for updates on Amazon's planned $100 billion AI-related spending and its effect on cloud business capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which naturally leads to more legal challenges requiring the high court's intervention. Kavanaugh stated the court has improved its process for these cases, sometimes scheduling emergency arguments to ensure a correct outcome. He also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, describing them as patriots who thoughtfully engage with difficult issues, even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is currently weighing the legality of the Trump administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. During arguments, judges questioned whether the law, which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such broad authority to set levies without specific mention of tariffs. The case, brought by states and small businesses, challenges the administration's claim that trade deficits constitute a national emergency justifying the duties. The court's decision will be a major test of the president's economic agenda and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

The judges detailed receiving death threats, being "pizza-doxxed," and even being "swatted," where false emergency calls draw armed police to their homes. They warned that inflammatory language from political leaders emboldens individuals to threaten judges and undermines the rule of law. The judges called for leaders to tone down their rhetoric and for others to speak out in defense of an independent judiciary.</p>

The new ballroom will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, significantly larger than the current East Room.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a wild potato-like species. Researchers found that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event combined a key gene from the tomato, which signals the plant to form tubers, with a gene from the wild species that controls tuber growth. This genetic combination was essential for the evolution of the starchy vegetable we know today. The discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, finally solves the long-standing mystery of the potato's evolutionary origins.</p>

This allows the yacht to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel, thereby bypassing the import tariff, although it involves registration fees. While this tactic is financially viable for large superyachts, owners of smaller boats will likely have to absorb the new costs, creating a divide in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>England's Bowling Attack Suffers Setback as Chris Woakes Injured in Test Match Against India</h2>

          <p>England's efforts on the opening day of the decisive fifth Test against India were overshadowed by a significant shoulder injury to pace bowler Chris Woakes. Woakes was forced to leave the field late in the day, leaving England's already depleted bowling attack with a potential shortage of options for the remainder of the crucial match. Despite the setback and inconsistent bowling, England managed to take six Indian wickets, leaving the tourists at 204-6 when rain stopped play. The outcome of the series, which England leads 2-1, could now hinge on their ability to perform without one of their key players.</p>

          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who took over in September, has outlined his plan to revitalize the coffee giant, stating the company was "mismanaged for a couple of years." His "Back to Starbucks" strategy centers on a new "green apron service model" focused on improving hospitality and efficiency to boost sales and customer experience. Key initiatives include reducing minimum staffing hours, implementing a smart queue system to shorten wait times, and encouraging more personalized employee-guest interactions. Despite recent lackluster earnings, some analysts are confident that Niccol's track record of corporate turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell bodes well for Starbucks.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 14:40:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the consumer protection known as the "95% rule" for federally insured reverse mortgages, or Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). This rule allows the heirs of a homeowner to keep the property by paying off either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever amount is less. This is particularly important when the accrued interest has caused the loan balance to exceed the home's market value. The provision offers peace of mind to senior homeowners, ensuring their loved ones will not be forced to pay more than the home is worth to retain it. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, rose to an annual rate of 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May. This increase suggests that new tariffs are beginning to push consumer prices higher, particularly for imported goods like furniture and appliances. The data provides context for the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, as inflation remains above its 2% target. The report also showed that while consumer spending saw a modest increase, incomes remained flat after adjusting for inflation, indicating continued caution among American households.

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards to influence betting markets, allegations that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While cleared of the main charges, Paqueta was found to have breached rules regarding cooperation with the investigation and will face a sanction for those failures. The verdict is a significant relief for the player, whose potential transfer to Manchester City in 2023 collapsed when the investigation became public.</p>

Wine industry representatives warn that this could significantly increase the retail price of popular French and Italian wines, while Scottish whisky distillers face similar pressures.

          <p>A new investigation has uncovered that China is circumventing U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The operation involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, where tankers turn off their transponders to avoid detection. This illicit trade, which generated as much as $70 billion for Iran last year, helps fund the Iranian regime and its programs while undermining U.S. sanctions.
