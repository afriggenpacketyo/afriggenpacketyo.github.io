OpenAI seeks punitive damages and an injunction to stop Musk's interference, citing his inability to accept the company's success after he abandoned it. The suit underscores the escalating tensions between OpenAI and Musk, who co-founded the company but later distanced himself.</p>

DeMaio argues that voter ID is a nonpartisan issue that would increase public trust in elections, citing polls showing widespread support for such requirements.

            <p>Despite President Trump's implementation of tariffs aimed at punishing Beijing, China's dominance in providing everyday goods to American consumers remains largely unshaken. A significant portion of items used daily in the United States, such as pens, pencils, and even Bibles, are sourced from Chinese factories. The tariffs primarily affect American consumers by increasing the cost of these essential goods. This highlights the complex interdependence of the US-China trade relationship, which may not be easily altered through tariff measures. (not investment advice)</p>
