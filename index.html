          <p>The Trump administration is exploring a novel "revenue-sharing" agreement that would allow companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for remitting 15% of the revenue to the U.S. government. This move represents a significant shift from previous export bans and has sparked alarm among trade experts, who warn it could set a dangerous precedent by making national security-based export controls appear to be for sale. Critics argue the policy, which functions like an export tax, may face legal challenges and could destabilize international trading relations by incentivizing lobbying for sensitive technology sales.

The exhibition is curated to emphasize the artist's "Russianness," focusing on significant periods of his life within the Russian Empire. This presentation comes amid a cultural dispute, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its own national cultural heritage. The event highlights the use of cultural diplomacy in the context of current geopolitical alignments.</p>

          <p>Nine months into his tenure, Manchester United's head coach Ruben Amorim is implementing significant changes to reverse the team's fortunes after a self-described "disaster season." His strategy involves a shift away from the rigid discipline of his predecessor, fostering a more positive training environment and empowering a six-player leadership group. Amorim is also reshaping the squad to fit his preferred 3-4-3 formation, which has involved costly new signings and tactical adjustments for key players like Bruno Fernandes. The club faces a challenging start to the season, with European qualification set as the minimum target.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence three weeks after her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. She posted photos from a night out with friends, making no direct comment on the controversy, which saw some critics label the ad's "great genes" wordplay as racially insensitive while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. American Eagle defended the campaign, stating it was always about the jeans. Reputation management experts suggest the controversy, regardless of its merits, could ultimately boost Sweeney's career and earning potential by generating significant media attention.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated that the subject refused to exit his vehicle, tried to run officers down, and struck two of them, prompting the agent to fire in self-defense. However, the driver claimed that unknown masked men tried to stop him and shot at him, leading to confusion and a call for police assistance. The incident has drawn criticism from immigrant justice advocates, who call it an abuse of power, and highlights jurisdictional complexities under California's sanctuary laws.</p>

          <p>Dan Tana, the founder of the eponymous West Hollywood Italian restaurant that has been a favored haunt for celebrities for six decades, has died at the age of 90 in Belgrade, Serbia. Born in the former Yugoslavia, Tana was a professional soccer player and actor before opening his restaurant in 1964, creating a late-night dining spot for stars like Elizabeth Taylor and George Clooney. Known for its classic red-sauce Italian-American fare and discreet service, the restaurant became an L.A. institution. Tana sold the establishment in 2009, but its legacy as a timeless piece of Hollywood history endures.</p>

          <p>A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi has reportedly been called off as trade relations between the two countries continue to sour. The cancellation comes as the U.S. has imposed a cumulative 50% tariff rate on Indian exports, one of the highest for any trading partner, partly as a penalty for India's purchase of Russian crude oil. India has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that the U.S. and EU also continue to trade with Russia. With the U.S. being India's largest single export partner, the stalled negotiations create uncertainty for Indian manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The long-standing "85th percentile rule," which sets speed limits based on the speed of the fastest 15% of drivers, is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies. This method, originating from 1930s studies on rural roads, is criticized for creating a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher official limits, even in urban areas with high pedestrian traffic. Amid rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that this is a guideline, not a mandatory rule, encouraging communities to also consider factors like pedestrian safety and crash frequency. Cities like Madison, Wisconsin, are now actively lowering residential speed limits to improve safety.</p>

The technique prepares what is described as "ionic glassy tissue," which preserves the organ's original structure and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells. This advancement allows for highly accurate visualization of the brain's intricate inner workings. The process also allows the tissues to be formed into a glassy solid at low temperatures, enabling long-term storage without compromising structural integrity.</p>

This shift aligns with Russian interests and raises fears that Ukraine will be pressured to concede more territory while fighting continues.

Unlike conventional aircraft, this design allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift at low speeds and then pivot to become parallel at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. This transformation allows the aircraft to function as a highly efficient waverider, minimizing drag and managing shock waves across different speed regimes.

          <p>A couples' therapist outlines five common psychological reasons why individuals, even those who seem to have stable lives, risk everything for an extramarital affair. These triggers include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to be "good," the burnout from perfectionism often rooted in trauma, and having poor boundaries developed from being parentified as a child. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can lead to seeking reprieve elsewhere.

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego's Sorrento Valley on Saturday afternoon due to apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was reportedly en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. The California Highway Patrol and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the incident. Remarkably, no injuries were reported from the landing, though it caused a significant traffic disruption, with all southbound lanes being temporarily closed and diverted.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched peacefully to the White House to demonstrate against President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" and the subsequent deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. The rally began in DuPont Circle, with demonstrators chanting against what they called a "fascist takeover" of the city's governance. The protest followed a successful legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that prevented the White House from appointing a federal emergency police commissioner to control the local police force. Participants expressed concern that the federal intervention is an overreach based on an exaggerated portrayal of crime in the city.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in trade tensions, Chinese merchants selling goods on international e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain concerned about the potential for future U.S. tariffs. At a recent trade fair, sellers expressed anxiety over policy uncertainties that could disrupt their access to the lucrative American market. One electronics company noted it had to suspend its U.S. business for nearly two months earlier in the year when bilateral relations deteriorated. This ongoing apprehension highlights the precarious position of Chinese sellers who rely heavily on U.S. consumers, even as they are encouraged to target the large market.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., as part of President Trump's public safety emergency declaration "may be armed." An official clarified that while the troops will not be making arrests, they may carry weapons consistent with their mission to protect federal property and provide a secure environment for law enforcement. This statement marks a shift from earlier guidance which indicated that weapons would be available but kept in an armory. The deployment is part of a broader federal intervention in the city, which has been met with protests and legal challenges from local officials.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump has reportedly told European leaders he supports a peace plan for Ukraine that would require Kyiv to relinquish control of the Donbas region. Sources indicate Putin's offer involves Ukraine withdrawing from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in exchange for Russia freezing the current front lines elsewhere. This proposal would require Ukraine to surrender significant, heavily fortified territory it still controls in Donetsk. The reported plan represents a major diplomatic development, suggesting a potential U.S.-backed resolution that aligns closely with Russian strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>COVID-19 rates are surging across the United States, with the Southwest experiencing the highest positivity rate at 12.5%, driven by the new, highly contagious "Stratus" variant. The spike coincides with students returning to school and follows a controversial change in CDC policy, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which no longer recommends updated COVID shots for all healthy children. Public health experts have criticized this decision, pointing to data showing the effectiveness of boosters in reducing hospitalization and death. The Stratus variant, first detected in the U.S. in March, now accounts for two-thirds of detected virus variants nationwide.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. Former software CEO Mike Conner purchased the abandoned island for £555,000 in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable. The historic fortress, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and its own nightclub. The extensive project required overcoming major logistical hurdles, including bringing all materials and equipment in by helicopter to the remote off-grid location.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the six-week summer holidays. One mother utilizes her freezer to store discounted "yellow sticker" meat and other items purchased over several months in preparation for the break. Another parent rations snacks by putting food for each day into separate bags and storing them out of children's reach. These strategies, along with using local food pantries and batch cooking, help families stretch their budgets as they lose access to subsidized school meals during the extended holiday period.</p>
