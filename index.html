          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy, 66, is embarking on his first major tour in 45 years, requiring him to relearn his own songs and guitar skills after decades focused on a behind-the-scenes career as a television writer and producer. Cassidy, son of Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy, found fame in the 1970s as a pop star and actor, but admitted he never enjoyed the public spotlight. His "The Road to Us Tour" will feature classic hits, new music, and personal stories, with Cassidy taking on the bass guitar for a fresh challenge. He expresses that the songs feel new to him, allowing him to sing better than in his youth.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football team experienced a significant 30-23 loss to UNLV, marking their second consecutive defeat and exposing ongoing problems within the program. The article details how the Bruins' defense was frequently out of position and slow, while the offense struggled to sustain drives and capitalize on opportunities. Despite a late fourth-quarter rally that offered a chance for a comeback, a crucial interception ended their hopes, leaving the team 0-2 for the first time since 2019. This defeat intensifies pressure on coach DeShaun Foster early in his second season, raising questions about the team's overall productivity and defensive capabilities.</p>

          <p>A recent Russian overnight drone attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in the deaths of at least two people and left 11 injured, according to local officials. Tragically, one of the victims was a one-year-old baby, whose body was recovered from the rubble, alongside a young woman. The strikes also targeted Kryvyi Rih, President Zelensky's hometown, hitting three infrastructure facilities, as air raid warnings activated across the country. This attack occurred amidst Russian President Vladimir Putin's intensified warnings against Western aid to Ukraine, with several multi-story residential buildings partially destroyed and ablaze.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, rallying support for Mamdani's progressive campaign and condemning oligarchic control in the US. Sanders praised Mamdani's grassroots movement as a "test case" for democracy against wealthy donors and media moguls aligned with figures like Donald Trump.

          <p>The USC Trojans' offense delivered a dominant performance, routing Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team 59-20, accumulating 755 yards—the most for USC in two decades. Quarterback Jayden Maiava threw four touchdowns and shattered his career high with 412 passing yards before the fourth quarter. The rushing attack also excelled, gaining 309 yards, a new high for the Lincoln Riley era. Despite a sloppy start with a fumble and a defensive penalty, USC quickly found its rhythm, with receivers Ja’Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon making significant plays. While the defense showed some vulnerabilities, the overwhelming offensive power secured another seamless win for the Trojans.</p>

The Sunday Telegraph reports that the new Home Secretary plans to move asylum seekers into barracks, a move to "get a grip" on the small boats crisis. The Sunday Times suggests the cabinet is ready to overhaul human rights laws to counter Nigel Farage's influence, potentially unsettling some MPs. Additionally, the Sunday Express highlights HMRC's failure to answer millions of business calls, leading to a "staggering" £47bn in uncollected taxes. Many papers also express disappointment over England's lackluster 2-0 World Cup qualifying win against Andorra.</p>

This article details Linda's first-time public account, where she maintains her innocence, describing the events as a series of tragic accidents. Her conviction was previously overturned due to issues with her initial defense and prosecution, but new evidence and witness testimonies, including claims of financial troubles, an affair, and Todd's past arson suspicions, led to her second conviction.

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air by harnessing the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles on the surface. When these bubbles reach a critical size, they violently collapse, releasing a powerful force that propels the small jumpers. Scientists can control the launch and even enable the materials to swim by manipulating the light flow, demonstrating a new efficient launching mechanism through cavitation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a devastating 4-3 walk-off loss to the Baltimore Orioles, dramatically collapsing after pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was one out shy of a no-hitter. Yamamoto delivered a dominant 8⅔ innings, striking out 10 with only two walks, before giving up a wall-scrapping home run. Manager Dave Roberts' decision to pull Yamamoto after 112 pitches led to a bullpen implosion, as reliever Blake Treinen struggled with control, walking two batters and hitting another. Closer Tanner Scott then gave up a two-run, walk-off single, turning a night on the verge of history into a painful nadir for the struggling Dodgers, who are now barely leading their division.</p>

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, including homestays and guest houses, is experiencing a significant downturn, leading many operators to regret their investments. Following a short-lived "revenge travel" boom after pandemic restrictions eased in late 2022, the market quickly faced a surge in supply, declining guest spending, and thinning bookings, creating a classic boom-and-bust cycle. A report by Fastdata indicated that nearly 60% of operators, many established within the last three years, now regret entering the market, with some lamenting working for a housekeeper's wage despite pouring millions into their businesses.

Reeves dismisses claims of a UK-specific challenge, emphasizing global trends. Her team is expected to leverage market instability to argue against increased borrowing, suggesting any fiscal gap will require higher taxes or reduced spending.

The organization aims to provide a "cathartic" community where women can share experiences, laugh, and joke about their shared paths.</p>

          <p>Mount Sinai, a site revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, is at the center of a controversy as Egypt proceeds with plans to transform it into a luxury tourism mega-project. The "Great Transfiguration Project" includes constructing hotels, villas, and shopping bazaars, raising deep concerns about its impact on the long-isolated, desert location and its Unesco World Heritage status. The indigenous Bedouin community, the Jebeleya tribe, has already faced home demolitions and forced relocation of graves with little compensation. Critics argue this top-down development disregards local interests and threatens the site's unique natural and spiritual characteristics, despite government claims of sustainable development.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a new US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants for arrest and deportation. This article reports that the operation, expected to last several weeks, focuses on individuals released from custody despite ICE detainers, particularly in "sanctuary cities" like Boston. DHS criticized Boston's Mayor Michelle Wu's sanctuary policies, claiming they harbor criminals and jeopardize public safety. Wu, however, defended her city's policies as crucial for community policing and safety, while actively preparing for potential federal national guard deployment and reviewing legal precedents to protect residents.</p>

          <p>An initial investigative report by Portugal's air and rail accident investigations bureau (GPIAAF) revealed that a cable linking two cabins snapped shortly before the deadly Lisbon funicular crash. The article states that the cable had passed a visual check hours before the derailment, and scheduled maintenance was up to date. Inspectors found that the Gloria funicular's two cabins traveled only about 6 meters before losing the balancing force from the connecting cable, leading to the accident in under 50 seconds. This finding is part of two independent investigations aiming to determine the causes of the crash that killed 16 people and injured 21.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoy military equipment, such as inflatable tanks and flat-pack guns, to deceive Russian forces and compel them to waste valuable ammunition and resources. This article highlights that a significant portion of frontline equipment, from radars to tanks, are imitations, with some weapon types having at least half their deployed units as decoys. Volunteers play a crucial role, manufacturing items like plywood M777 howitzer models that cost around $500-600 but draw expensive Russian Lancet kamikaze drones. The effectiveness of these decoys depends on realistic deployment, including wheel ruts and ammunition crates, successfully fooling even visiting commanders.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Carlo, who died of leukemia at 15, was known for creating websites to document "miracles" and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." His canonization was fast-tracked by the Vatican, with Pope Francis attributing two miracles to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. This article notes the increase in visitors to his baptismal church in Chelsea and highlights the excitement among young Catholics who feel a closer connection to a saint who played video games and wore jeans.</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team suffered a disappointing 2-0 defeat to South Korea, extending their summer of experimental malaise just 279 days before hosting the World Cup. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino defended the experimental approach, stating the team would be ready by the World Cup opener, but the article highlights significant failings, particularly a lack of defensive communication and missed scoring opportunities. South Korea, led by Son Heung-min's opening goal, exploited large gaps in the US formation, while the US struggled to convert their own chances. The team's lackluster performance raises "alarm bells" as their crucial moment in the global spotlight approaches.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly 40 years, transitioning to global editorial director, raising questions about the magazine's future relevance. This article explores Wintour's legacy, marked by her ability to capture the zeitgeist, such as putting Madonna on the cover and bridging fashion with entertainment. While some argue Vogue remains highly relevant, others believe print magazines struggle in a fast-paced digital world dominated by platforms like TikTok. Her successor, Chloe Malle, plans to issue less frequent, themed editions, aiming for a collectible product. Wintour's continued presence suggests a recognition of her unmatched industry influence and the challenge of maintaining Vogue's clout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% after the Trump administration eliminated a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The article explains that the "de minimis exemption," which allowed parcels valued at $800 or less to enter duty-free, was ended to combat tariff evasion and drug smuggling. This change has caused "major operational disruptions" as carriers are unwilling or unable to collect duties, and foreign postal operators lack connections to US Customs and Border Protection-approved parties. Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended service to the US, leading to the drastic reduction in traffic (not investment advice).</p>
