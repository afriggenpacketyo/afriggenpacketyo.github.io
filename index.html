          <p>Multiple UK newspapers lead with coverage of the chancellor's Spending Review, including a Â£39 billion investment in affordable housing. The Financial Times notes this as the "biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation," while the Daily Mirror highlights the plan to "turn the tide" on the housing crisis. The Times reports that the NHS will receive a Â£30 billion boost but still may not meet waiting list targets, and the Daily Mail cites figures showing a decline in job vacancies. Other stories include government plans to decriminalize rough sleeping and sanctions imposed on Israeli ministers by the UK government.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of violent disorder with petrol bombs, projectiles, and fireworks thrown at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. The unrest, described by police as "racially motivated," resulted in roads blocked with burning barricades and attacks on homes and businesses. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, with tensions exacerbated by claims of an oversubscription of migrants in the area. Politicians have condemned the violence, with some accusing others of exploiting the situation.</p>

The protest comes as OrbÃ¡n's party trails in polls ahead of the 2026 elections, with critics claiming he is employing authoritarian tactics to silence dissent. Concerns were raised about a draft bill that could blacklist critical media and NGOs, viewed as a threat to independent journalism and civic engagement.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, and Blake Snell are making progress in their recoveries from injuries, raising hopes for their return to the Dodgers' pitching rotation sooner than anticipated. Ohtani threw his third live batting practice, Glasnow threw a bullpen session, and Snell threw 15 pitches in the bullpen. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism, hinting at a potential return for Ohtani before the All-Star break. These developments signal a positive turn for the Dodgers' pitching staff, which has been facing a wave of injuries.</p>

          <p>The White House is reportedly pleased with the events unfolding in Los Angeles regarding the protests and the deployment of military forces. Officials believe that the situation highlights their focus on immigration and law and order, positioning Democrats on the wrong side of both issues. The decision to federalize the California National Guard and dispatch active-duty Marines marks a break with decades of tradition limiting the use of the military on American soil.</p>

          <p>Approximately 120 protesters gathered outside a federal building in Santa Ana in response to multiple ICE raids conducted across the city. Protesters, including Councilmember Jessie Lopez, expressed outrage and criticized U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. Activists blocked unmarked vans and clashed with federal agents, resulting in the use of pepper balls. The situation evolved into a tense standoff, with protesters eventually moving to a nearby park and engaging in chants and demonstrations throughout the afternoon and evening.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Can Stay in Place Amid Legal Battle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 21:45:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs can remain in place until at least the end of July amid an ongoing legal battle. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Trump administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs pending appeal. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled that many of Mr. Trump's signature tariffs are illegal, but the appellate court's decision extends the legal fight over their fate.
