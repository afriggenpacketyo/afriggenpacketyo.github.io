        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has partly upheld complaints against the punk duo Bob Vylan for their Glastonbury performance. The unit ruled that the broadcast, which included chants of "death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments, violated guidelines on harm and offence, characterizing some remarks as antisemitic. However, the performance was cleared of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime, with the ECU noting the context of a music festival and that chants were aimed at an institution. The BBC has acknowledged errors in its handling of the live stream and is implementing changes to its broadcast procedures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to be indicted on criminal charges in a Virginia federal court, according to an MSNBC report. The potential charges come after President Trump publicly called for his prosecution and replaced the interim U.S. attorney who had opposed filing charges. The indictment may accuse Comey of lying to Congress in 2020 regarding his authorization of a leak of information to the media during the 2016 election. The move is politically charged, with the new U.S. attorney having previously represented Trump in personal legal matters, and the statute of limitations for the charge is set to expire shortly.</p>

The article also covers several other recent events related to antisemitism, including a hate crime charge for a suspect in a Florida synagogue arson. Additionally, it mentions a witness report of a shooter at a New Hampshire wedding yelling "Free Palestine" and a new report from UN Watch alleging Hamas control over UNRWA's education system in Gaza.

          <p>HSBC has announced a "world-first" trial successfully using quantum computing to optimize its bond trading operations, in collaboration with IBM. The trial utilized a combination of classical computing and IBM's Heron quantum processor to achieve a 34% improvement in algorithmic bond price predictions. This advancement allows for more accurate estimations of trade success in over-the-counter markets, which can lead to increased margins and greater liquidity for the bank. The successful trial provides the first empirical evidence of quantum computing's practical application in the complex field of algorithmic bond trading, signaling a new frontier for technology in financial services.</p>

          <p>A cybercriminal group named Radiant claims to have stolen highly sensitive personal information, including photos, names, and addresses, of approximately 8,000 children from the Kido nursery chain. The hackers are using this data in an extortion attempt, demanding a ransom from the company, which operates in the UK, US, and India. The group has reportedly contacted some parents directly and posted a sample of the stolen data, including pictures of ten children, on the darknet to apply pressure.

          <p>On the eve of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, U.S. golfer Bryson DeChambeau has publicly called on Donald Trump to inspire the American team to victory against Europe. Trump is expected to attend the first day of the tournament, prompting an intense security operation. DeChambeau believes the former president's presence will be an "electric" and positive force for the U.S. side. In contrast, European golfer Robert MacIntyre downplayed the visit, stating Trump is "just another spectator" and that his team remains focused on competing. Rory McIlroy avoided direct commentary on the rivalry but expressed his affinity for the United States.</p>

          <p>New vehicle sales in the U.S. have seen an unexpected increase, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units. Analysts attribute this resilience to consumers purchasing vehicles now out of fear of future price hikes driven by potential tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. This "pull-ahead" effect has boosted sales by 4.6% compared to last year, benefiting major automakers like General Motors and Toyota. However, this trend is expected to slow in the fourth quarter as the incentives disappear and tariff costs are integrated into vehicle pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump initially joked about the issues, he later claimed they were deliberate acts and that he and the first lady could have been seriously injured. In response, the UN stated the escalator likely stopped due to a safety feature triggered by a U.S. delegation videographer. The UN also noted that its sound system prioritizes translated audio through earpieces, which may have made the direct speech seem quiet.</p>

In a CNBC interview, Griffin argued that such government intervention in picking winners and losers is fundamentally un-American and ultimately harmful to the economy. He described the line of businesses seeking exemptions at the White House as "nauseating" and warned that this approach undermines innovation. Griffin also characterized tariffs as a "national sales tax" that raises fairness issues by disproportionately affecting lower-income households and creating an unstable business environment dependent on political favors.</p>

His supporters question the severity of the sentence, especially since he was acquitted of three other charges and the sentence is not suspended pending appeal. Conversely, critics view him as a powerful figure who has consistently bent the law, citing his two previous corruption convictions, and see the sentence as just accountability for a serious offense.</p>

          <p>Beginning next month, Americans traveling to most European countries will be required to have their fingerprints scanned and a picture taken upon arrival under the new Entry/Exit System (EES). This change applies to visitors from all non-EU countries entering the 29-nation Schengen Area, which includes popular destinations like France, Italy, and Spain. The new automated system will replace manual passport stamping and is designed to enhance security and better track who enters and leaves the zone. Travelers who refuse to provide the required biometric data will be denied entry, according to EU officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Department for Education (DfE) has proposed a plan to increase the fees that private schools in England pay for inspections conducted by the regulator Ofsted. Last year, these inspections cost £6.5 million, but schools only covered £2.2 million through fees, with taxpayers subsidizing the rest. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson argued that taxpayers should not be funding private businesses in this manner. The proposed fee hikes, to be phased in over five years, would apply to approximately 1,150 "non-association" independent schools, many of which are smaller institutions that support pupils with special educational needs.</p>

          <p>An independent report investigating the delayed evacuation alerts during the deadly Eaton fire in Altadena has attributed the failures to chaotic conditions and poor communication rather than assigning blame to specific agencies. The report, released eight months after the fire killed 19 people, found that L.A. County officials did not issue evacuation orders for the hard-hit west Altadena area until hours after 911 calls reported flames. Investigators noted a lack of a unified communication platform and incomplete documentation of evacuation decisions among the responsible agencies. The report also mentioned concerns about "over-warning" residents, a practice that experts advise against.</p>

His legal team has argued for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which could lead to his immediate release with credit for time served.

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, numerous foreign e-commerce companies have flooded social media with advertisements for memorial merchandise. An investigation by The Guardian found that many of these brands, which promote "Echo of Freedom" T-shirts and other apparel, are operated by companies based in China, despite presenting themselves as U.S.-based and veteran-run. These entities have used deceptive tactics, including listing fake U.S. addresses and falsely promising to donate profits to Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA. This profit-driven campaign exploits a tragic political event to target American consumers, raising concerns about disinformation and illegal foreign influence.</p>

Oklo's stock had previously surged over 470% this year on investor enthusiasm for its potential to power AI data centers, despite the company not yet having a license to build its first plant or generating any revenue.

After reaching the 8,849-meter summit, Bargiel successfully descended the mountain's treacherous slopes, a feat that required him to spend 16 hours in the high-altitude "death zone" due to heavy snowfall. This achievement is a groundbreaking milestone in ski mountaineering, as previous ski descents from the summit have relied on bottled oxygen. The successful expedition marks another major accomplishment for Bargiel, who previously became the first person to ski down K2, the world's second-highest peak, in 2018.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of every living former Federal Reserve chair and numerous ex-Treasury secretaries has filed a legal brief urging the Supreme Court to block President Trump from firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The group, which includes Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, argues that removing Cook while her lawsuit is pending would threaten the central bank's independence and erode public confidence in U.S. monetary policy. Trump moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Lower courts have so far barred her removal, but the Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to lift the injunction.</p>

Burnham has been critical of the government and claims some MPs have urged him to stand. However, a majority of Labour MPs contacted by the BBC expressed opposition to such a move, with one minister calling his comments "utterly self-indulgent" and others urging him to focus on his role as mayor. While there appears to be little appetite for a leadership change, the discussions reflect underlying anxiety within the party about upcoming elections and the rise of Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a "phased restart" of its operations after a major cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines.

However, its manufacturing plants in the UK remain closed until at least next month, and the prolonged shutdown has raised concerns that smaller firms in its supply chain could face bankruptcy.
