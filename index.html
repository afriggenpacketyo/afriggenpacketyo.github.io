          <p>Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, detailing a sexual assault incident in 2006. She described how Weinstein allegedly lunged at her, groped her, and forced her onto a bed in his apartment after she had worked for his company as a television production assistant. Haley stated she felt she had to endure the assault, fearing his actions could escalate to violence. She recounted an earlier incident in Cannes where Weinstein made inappropriate comments and requested a massage, and further testified that Weinstein later forcibly sexually assaulted her in a hotel room.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains what happens to a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) after the initial 10-year draw period. Typically, the HELOC transitions into a repayment period, where borrowers can no longer access funds and must begin repaying both principal and interest, often leading to significantly higher monthly payments. The article advises homeowners to prepare for this transition by making principal payments early, calculating future payments, exploring refinancing options, building an emergency fund, and paying down high-rate debt. The piece emphasizes that HELOCs are useful but require careful planning to avoid financial strain when the draw period ends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is weighing a case regarding the establishment of the first public religious charter school in the U.S., St. Isidore, a Catholic virtual school in Oklahoma. The court's conservative majority seemed open to the idea, suggesting that denying the school's charter status would be discrimination against religion. Arguments centered on whether the school is a government entity and whether creating such a school violates the separation of church and state. A ruling in favor of the school could significantly impact the role of religion in government-funded education. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court seemed split on whether Oklahoma can use public funds for a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore, with Republican appointees largely supportive and Democratic appointees wary. The case tests the limits of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and could have broad implications for religious charter schools nationwide. Justices debated whether excluding the school constitutes religious discrimination and whether the state's involvement is too comprehensive. A decision in favor of the school could significantly alter the landscape of government funding for religious education.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including a deportation program targeting alleged gang members, are facing legal challenges. The ACLU and other civil rights advocates argue that the policies violate due process and U.S. law. One controversial policy is the use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants to CECOT, an El Salvador prison. While border crossings have decreased since Trump took office, concerns are mounting over wrongful deportations and the administration's resistance to court orders. </p>

          <p>Budget airline Avelo is facing a backlash for agreeing to operate deportation flights for ICE, with protests erupting at its Connecticut hub. The airline says the deal provides financial stability, but critics argue it's profiting from deportations. Avelo will join ICE Air Operations carriers that operate these flights with little transparency. The airline has been criticized for underestimating the potential public outcry and is now facing calls for state lawmakers to revoke support for the airline.</p>

          <p>Federal agencies, including the FBI and DHS, are increasing their use of polygraph tests to find potential leakers. Polygraph tests measure physiological changes, but experts debate their reliability in detecting deception. While polygraphs can be helpful in investigations, they should not be the sole determining factor. Concerns have been raised about the broad use of polygraphs and the potential impact on morale. Experts suggest that polygraphs are more effective at triggering confessions than detecting lies.</p>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop of over 14% after the company withheld its second-quarter guidance, citing concerns about the uncertain macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on advertising demand.

Fears of a weakening economy and President Trump's shifting tariff plans have created an unsettling backdrop for the company.</p>

          <p>Financial planners suggest keeping enough cash in a checking account to cover a month's worth of bills, with a small buffer for peace of mind, but not so much that it misses out on potential interest earnings or becomes more exposed to fraud. Experts recommend balancing the need for easy access to funds with the benefits of higher-yield savings accounts. The ideal balance is personal and should allow for living without constantly checking the balance before making purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta is set to report its first-quarter earnings, with investors closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's China tariffs on the company's online ads business. Analysts anticipate that Meta's China-derived advertising revenue will be most affected by the tariffs. There are also concerns on how Trump's tariffs will affect Meta's big spending on artificial intelligence. The company is expected to report 3.39 billion daily active people for the first quarter.</p>

          <p>The US economy experienced a chaotic start to the year due to President Trump’s tariff policies. The underlying economic growth remained solid in early 2025, but tariffs and uncertainty are expected to cause a further slowdown. The first-quarter decline was largely a result of quirks in the way economic activity is measured. Economists predict either that the first-quarter inventory figures will be revised higher when more complete data become available or that inventories will jump again next quarter, providing a temporary lift to G.D.P.
