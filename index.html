          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, reaching as high as $109,500. This surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has increased focus on alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Investors are also anticipating upcoming regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments, which are expected to further drive Bitcoin prices higher. The Senate has voted to advance legislation creating the first regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S., and Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500, marking a significant milestone for the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, has successfully dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide between March 16 and May 16. The Lumma malware, popular among hackers, was used to steal passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft worked with companies like Cloudflare, Bitsight, and Lumen to break down the malware ecosystem, and the U.S. Department of Justice took control of Lumma's central command structure, suspending locally based infrastructure with the help of cybercrime control centers in Japan. The article notes that the malware was easy to spread and circumvent security defenses, making it a go-to tool for cybercriminals.</p>

          <p>The UK's inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, driven by increases in household bills like gas, electricity, and water, impacting individuals and families across the country. Tracy McGuigan-Haigh, a retail worker and mother, shared that the cost of everyday items has become unsustainable, with supermarket shops becoming increasingly expensive. Ieuan Hood, a single father of three, noted that increased universal credit payments have been offset by higher bills, leaving him with little to no money at the end of the month.

          <p>President Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Republican holdouts met to address issues with the "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," which faces significant challenges due to disagreements among Republicans. Sticking points include Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deduction caps. Hard-liners threaten to vote against the bill, which includes changes to Medicaid, SNAP, and immigration policy. House leadership aims to bring the bill to the floor, but its success hinges on Trump's ability to sway the holdouts, with the House Freedom Caucus seeking steeper cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of Inflation Reduction Act subsidies.</p>

While proponents argue it provides relief to hardworking Americans, critics suggest it could lead to issues such as income misclassification and the introduction of tips in new occupations.

          <p>Homeland Security officials confirmed the deportation of eight migrants convicted of crimes but declined to reveal their destination, leading to a federal judge holding a hearing to determine if his order requiring 15 days' notice for deportations to third countries was violated. The flight, according to sources, landed in Djibouti, East Africa, raising concerns about due process and the safety of the deportees. Lawyers for the migrants have accused the administration of bending court orders, and the judge has threatened sanctions for criminal contempt if violations are found. The article notes that this is one of several deportation proceedings where the administration has faced accusations of denying immigrants due process.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is dismissing lawsuits against police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, ending investigations launched during the Biden administration. The administration argues that the proposed consent decrees imposed sweeping terms that exceeded accusations of unconstitutional conduct. The federal involvement began following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and the decision comes just days before the five-year mark since Floyd's death. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that the administration is retracting findings of unconstitutional violations by eight departments and is considering dismissing over a dozen other consent decrees.</p>
