          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve received a one-game suspension and fine from the WNBA for her aggressive conduct and comments towards officials following a playoff loss to the Phoenix Mercury. Her actions included verbally abusing a game official, failing to leave the court promptly after ejection, and making inappropriate remarks to fans and in a post-game press conference. Reeve strongly criticized the officiating crew's competence, citing a controversial play where a Lynx player was injured, and called for league-level changes to officiating standards. This marks the first time a WNBA coach has been suspended for a playoff game, highlighting ongoing concerns about officiating in the league.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel clarified that 274 plainclothes agents were present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, but stated they were deployed for crowd control *after* the riot began, which he claims violates FBI standards. Patel accused former Director Christopher Wray of lying to Congress by not disclosing this presence, asserting that the agents were not involved in inciting the events prior to the riot. This revelation follows President Trump's earlier claims about FBI involvement and is presented as part of an effort to uncover the truth and ensure accountability within the FBI.</p>

The article highlights the American team's capitulation and poor crowd behavior at Bethpage Black, with personal insults directed at European players. Despite the unsportsmanlike atmosphere, Europe delivered a superb performance, making history with their largest-ever pre-singles lead. Tensions also flared between players on the course, further underscoring the intensity of the competition.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler experienced a historic and dismal performance at the Ryder Cup, losing his first four matches and becoming the first American to do so. Despite his recent dominance in stroke-play, Scheffler's putting struggles and inability to adapt his game to the team format were ruthlessly exposed. His individual struggles became an emblem of the broader American defeat, highlighting how even top-ranked players can falter under the unique pressures of the Ryder Cup. This article analyzes the mental and technical aspects of his unexpected downturn.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the swing justice. Kennedy discusses his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, revealing how his views evolved, particularly on the struggles faced by children of gay parents. He also shares a poignant reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia before Scalia's death. Kennedy expresses deep concern over the current Supreme Court's increasing partisanship and the decline of respectful discourse in American society, advocating for a more moderate tone in judicial opinions.</p>

          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic. While some users report positive changes in skin, hair, and nails, dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach the skin in significant amounts. Collagen peptides, smaller molecules, are designed for better absorption but still face a challenging journey through the body. Experts suggest that sunblock, a healthy diet, and lifestyle choices offer far greater benefits for skin health than expensive collagen supplements, with some industry-funded studies showing conflicting results compared to independent research.</p>

          <p>California faces a severe housing shortage, but quantifying its exact scale remains a complex challenge, with estimates ranging from 56,000 to 3.5 million units. This article explains that the discrepancies arise from differing methodologies, such as target vacancy rates, calculations of "pent-up demand," and definitions of "affordable" housing. While lawmakers agree on the existence of a crisis, the lack of a consistent metric complicates policy-making and progress measurement. Researchers suggest that regardless of the precise number, the consensus points to a massive deficit, underscoring the urgent need for significant action to address the state's housing needs.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless 2020 election-rigging claims. Giuliani, a former personal lawyer to President Trump, had spread conspiracy theories alleging Dominion's systems were manipulated. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, underscoring the legal and financial consequences for those who promoted false election fraud narratives. The lawsuit was part of a series of setbacks for Giuliani, who has also faced disbarment and significant financial penalties for his role in undermining public confidence in U.S. elections.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer launched a strong attack on the Reform Party, labeling its politics as "toxic" and "unpatriotic" ahead of Labour's annual conference. Starmer accused Reform leader Nigel Farage of "grubbing around in America" and talking down the UK, contrasting this with Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal." The criticism comes as Reform continues to lead in opinion polls, particularly on immigration policies like abolishing indefinite leave to remain, a proposal that divides the public. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood also weighed in, advocating for migrants to make broader community contributions beyond just their jobs.</p>
