          <p>Authorities in Rongjiang county, located in China's southwestern Guizhou province, are preparing for more severe rainfall after record-breaking floods recently killed at least six people. The previous deluge inundated low-lying areas, caused significant infrastructure damage, and submerged the county's largest shopping center. Hydrological stations recorded water levels far exceeding safety limits, prompting new evacuation orders for several areas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from Fox News posits that the idea of the "transgender child" is a dangerous concept manufactured by a convergence of psychiatry, endocrinology, and political activism. The author traces the idea's origins to the 1960s and its formalization in the DSM-III, arguing it pathologized gender nonconformity, which often would have resolved into homosexuality. The piece contends that puberty blockers and activist rebranding have medicalized children based on ideology rather than evidence, locking them into a path of treatment before they can truly understand the stakes. It concludes that "trans kids" do not exist, only gender-nonconforming children who are being misled.</p>

          <p>Following a backbench revolt that forced a U-turn on welfare cuts, UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the nation's "broken" benefits system is a moral imperative. Speaking at a party conference, he asserted that while the safety net for vulnerable people will be protected, the system should not trap those who are able to work. The government had to concede on its initial plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) after facing significant opposition. Despite the concessions, some MPs and unions like Unite are demanding more substantial changes or a complete withdrawal of the proposed reforms.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump has suggested that he or another member of the Trump family might consider running for president after his father's potential second term concludes. In an interview, he stated that the political path "would be an easy one" for him or other family members if they chose to pursue it. While he has primarily focused on the family business, he expressed being "wholly unimpressed" by many current politicians. He cited the personal toll and "brutality" of the political system as the main deterrents that would factor into any future decision for his family.</p>

A recent UN report indicates that over 71,000 refugees were deported in the first half of June alone, returning to an Afghanistan already suffering from severe humanitarian distress under Taliban rule. Aid groups are overwhelmed, and funding from international donors has been drastically cut, leaving returnees with little to no support.

The author uses the example of a shooting involving Minnesota lawmakers, a story that quickly faded from headlines in favor of the international conflict. While acknowledging the importance of covering the president's actions, the article suggests that the intense, often sensationalized focus on war benefits both politicians seeking to control the narrative and media outlets seeking ratings.

This backlash comes after Wall Street's preferred candidate, Andrew Cuomo, was defeated despite receiving massive financial support from the business community.

          <p>A report by the nonprofit Earthsight alleges that luxury fashion brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, are using leather sourced from cattle raised on illegally deforested land in Brazil. The investigation traces the supply chain from farms operating within protected Indigenous territory to a Brazilian meatpacker, Frigol, and then to Italian tanneries that supply the high-end brands. The report highlights gaps in supply chain monitoring, such as "cattle laundering," which allows hides from illegal operations to enter the market. While most of the accused companies have denied the specific allegations, the findings raise serious questions about the ethics and sustainability of luxury goods.</p>

While NOAA claims its own data sources are sufficient, researchers worry the loss will create significant gaps in observation, potentially leading to surprise intensifications of dangerous storms.

Following a poor tee shot on the ninth hole, Koepka smashed his club into the ground and then hit a tee box marker, sending it towards a small group of spectators. The marker did not appear to strike anyone, and LIV officials later stated that the 35-year-old American had been feeling unwell all week. At the time of his withdrawal, he was six over par after playing eight holes.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials have strongly condemned a Haaretz newspaper report that quoted anonymous Israeli soldiers describing orders to fire on unarmed civilians at food aid sites in Gaza. The report detailed a "killing field" where troops allegedly use lethal force against hungry crowds, even when they pose no threat. Israeli leaders labeled the report a "blood libel," while the military rejected the accusations but stated the incidents are being examined. Aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders have corroborated the high number of casualties at these sites, calling the aid system a "slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid."</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift driven by the war in Ukraine and a potential new Trump presidency, Germany is planning to build the largest military in Europe. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that the government will now provide the military with the necessary funding to become the continent's strongest armed force, aiming to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense. This move involves a constitutional change to suspend Germany's "debt brake," allowing for nearly $400 billion in defense spending through 2029 without cutting social programs. The decision marks a historic reversal of Germany's post-war pacifist stance, reflecting a new sense of urgency in European security.</p>

          <p>Despite being a deep-red state that overwhelmingly supports Donald Trump, Kentucky has become a surprising center of Republican resistance to the president's agenda. Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, have frequently opposed Trump on issues ranging from foreign policy and war powers to tariffs and spending. This opposition has angered many of the president's supporters in the state and prompted Trump to call for a primary challenge against Massie. The dynamic showcases a rare intra-party rift, reflecting Kentucky's unique political landscape where different factions of the GOP coexist uneasily.</p>

          <p>Following devastating wildfires, some Los Angeles County residents are seeking to rebuild their homes using fire-resistant and sustainable natural materials like adobe and straw bale. However, architects and engineers report that the county's permitting process for these alternative materials is unclear and potentially onerous, creating significant risks for homeowners. While county officials express openness to such projects, they require extensive and costly testing reports, a standard that advocates say is unfeasible for individual projects. This regulatory uncertainty is forcing many fire victims to abandon their plans for more resilient homes and opt for conventional wood-frame construction instead.</p>

The victory was driven by Protect HB, a nonpartisan coalition of residents who felt the conservative council had overreached with its agenda.

He spent 27 years in prison, eight in solitary confinement, before his conviction was overturned in 1997 after decades of legal battles revealed the extent of the official corruption.

Citing the foundational role of drag queens and trans individuals at Stonewall, the piece asserts that the movement's strength comes from its inclusivity.

The delay is puzzling to legal experts, who note that the court's conservative majority has previously limited the scope of the 1965 law. The ultimate ruling could make it significantly harder to challenge voting maps that dilute the power of minority voters across the country.</p>

          <h2>Trump Navigates High-Stakes Week of Domestic Legislation and Foreign Policy Challenges</h2>

          <p>President Trump's administration is facing a pivotal period with major unresolved issues at home and abroad. Domestically, his "one big beautiful bill," a massive tax and spending package, faces an uncertain fate in the Senate as he pushes for a July 4th signing. In foreign policy, the administration is managing the aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran and a fragile ceasefire, while also facing a deadline on numerous trade deals. Capping the week was a Supreme Court victory that limits the power of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a significant win for the president's agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ukraine Explores Interceptor Drones as a Cost-Effective Defense Against Russian Attacks</h2>

          <p>As Russia intensifies its drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Ukraine is increasingly turning to interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized, high-speed drones are being developed and deployed to counter Russian Shahed drones, which now fly at higher altitudes, making them difficult for mobile ground units to target. Experts argue that mass-producing these interceptor drones is a critical and more cost-effective solution than using expensive anti-aircraft missiles, which can cost up to $1 million per shot compared to around $5,000 for a drone. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has confirmed a focus on developing this technology.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tehran for a state funeral honoring dozens of high-ranking military commanders and others killed in recent Israeli strikes. Top Iranian officials, including the president, attended the ceremony for figures like the Chief of Staff and the head of the IRGC's aerospace division. The attacks, which Israel claimed were to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat, killed over 30 senior military officials. In the aftermath, Iran has indicated a conditional willingness to resume nuclear talks with the U.S. but has also threatened to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
