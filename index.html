          <p>The Trump administration's restructuring of FEMA's hiring process, involving the dismissal of numerous probationary employees and a new review system for contract renewals, has raised concerns about the agency's capacity to handle upcoming hurricane season.  This move, driven by broader efforts to reduce the federal workforce, has left many FEMA employees worried about job security and the agency's ability to effectively respond to disasters. The administration defends the changes as necessary to cut wasteful spending and bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump revoked the security clearances of several prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  This action, part of a broader pattern of targeting political opponents,  is justified by the President as necessary to address what he sees as the weaponization of intelligence and law enforcement against him.  The move has been met with criticism from Democrats and some Republicans.</p>

          <p>Columbia University's decision to comply with Trump administration demands, including the supervision of an academic department and increased campus security, is criticized as a capitulation to intimidation tactics.  This action is viewed as a betrayal of academic freedom and freedom of speech, contrasting with the actions of other institutions that chose to resist similar pressures.  The author argues that strong institutions should stand firm against such bullying.</p>

          <p>Global trust in the United States has significantly declined, forcing leaders worldwide to recalibrate their relationships.
