          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have made home equity loans more affordable for homeowners, who currently hold an average of $300,000 in equity. For a $90,000 loan, the monthly payment on a 15-year term has decreased to approximately $871, down from around $886 at the beginning of the year. While the costs are lower than in recent history, they have not dropped dramatically enough to make it a clear choice over a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Homeowners are advised to carefully weigh their options, as the loan uses their home as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has publicly stated his belief that Jeffrey Epstein participated in sexual abuse with his high-profile associates and likely used video blackmail to secure a lenient sentence in 2008. This assertion contradicts the official stance of the FBI, which has found no credible information that Epstein trafficked individuals to others. A prominent victims' rights lawyer also noted that while some associates were involved in sexual acts, it was a small fraction of Epstein's overall abuse. Lutnick, Epstein's former neighbor, described him as a serial sex offender who must have traded incriminating material for his favorable plea deal.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Supreme Court has set a September 30, 2026, execution date for Christa Gail Pike, who will be the first woman executed in the state in over 100 years. Pike was convicted for the 1995 torture and murder of Colleen Slemmer when both were teenagers in a career training program. Her attorneys have argued for clemency, citing her history of mental illness, brain damage, and childhood abuse, which were not presented at her original trial. Advocacy groups note that societal views on capital punishment have shifted, suggesting a modern jury would be unlikely to sentence a person with Pike's background to death.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global shift to green energy technologies is driving a massive demand for "transition minerals" like lithium and cobalt, creating a paradox where environmental protection necessitates increased mining. This extraction often devastates local ecosystems and disproportionately harms Indigenous and impoverished communities through water contamination and displacement. A new book, "Extraction" by Thea Riofrancos, argues that this dilemma stems from a limited vision focused on replacing individual gas cars with electric ones. The author suggests that reimagining urban design and transportation to prioritize mass transit could reduce mineral demand by over 90%, offering a more sustainable and equitable path away from fossil fuels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned under pressure after a disagreement with the Trump administration regarding a gift for King Charles III. Arrington reportedly resisted a request to provide an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection for the president's state visit to the U.K., arguing it was the property of the American people.

The bank also highlighted BlackRock's strategic position to capitalize on growth in alternative assets, such as private-market infrastructure investments, which are in high demand due to the AI boom.

          <p>An expedition team from Purdue University is preparing to investigate a "visual anomaly" on a remote Pacific island that they believe is the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro island, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after Earhart's disappearance. Researchers cite "very strong" evidence and plan to use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge and identify the object. If confirmed to be Earhart's Electra 10E plane, the university hopes to bring it back to its campus, as Earhart had planned to return it there after her historic flight.</p>

His lawyer contests the police's claims, stating the drugs were found in a car with three other occupants.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has shown that artificial intelligence can be used to create designs for hazardous proteins that bypass the biosecurity filters used by DNA synthesis companies. Researchers used an AI tool to generate over 75,000 variants of toxic proteins by "paraphrasing" their DNA codes, which slipped past the screening systems designed to flag dangerous orders. While a software fix was quickly developed, it is not yet perfect, highlighting the growing challenge of preventing the misuse of powerful biological tools. The incident underscores long-standing concerns in the scientific community about AI accelerating the potential for creating novel biothreats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that the financial devastation from wildfires has accelerated significantly in the last decade, driven by record-breaking heat and drought conditions linked to climate change. Researchers analyzed insurance loss data from 1980 to 2023 and found that 43% of the 200 most costly fires on record occurred in the past ten years alone. The analysis shows a "step change" in disaster frequency around 2015, with exceptionally severe fires causing a disproportionate amount of the damage. These escalating costs are straining financial systems and increasing insurance rates for homeowners in fire-prone regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, a 7% increase from the same period last year, though its stock dipped following the report. The sales figures were likely boosted by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase vehicles before a key federal tax credit for EVs expired at the end of the quarter. While deliveries were up, vehicle production declined slightly compared to the previous year. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe but offset by stronger demand in the U.S. ahead of the policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French authorities have charged the captain of the oil tanker Boracay, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent sanctions. The Chinese national faces charges of refusing to comply with naval orders after the vessel was boarded by French soldiers earlier this week. The tanker, which had departed from Russia, is on a list of vessels subject to EU sanctions for carrying Russian oil. The Boracay has changed its name and flag multiple times, and the captain was reportedly unable to provide a coherent answer about the ship's nationality, which is a violation of international maritime law.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Donald Trump's recent characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger," asserting that Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine against the full strength of the NATO alliance. Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Group, Putin dismissed the label and warned that Moscow would respond swiftly to any perceived European provocation. He claimed that Russia feels confident in its military operations and suggested that if Russia is a paper tiger while fighting the entire NATO bloc, then one should question NATO's own strength. Putin also told NATO members to "sleep calmly" and address their own domestic problems.</p>

          <p>At least eight people, including three police officers and five civilians, have been killed during violent protests in the Pakistan-controlled region of Kashmir. The unrest began when thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to demand an end to what they describe as unfair privileges for the political elite, such as free electricity and luxury vehicles. In response, authorities shut down internet and mobile services and reportedly warned media against covering the events. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered to form a committee to investigate the violence and engage in dialogue with the protesters.</p>

          <p>Recent polling indicates that President Trump's support among Latino voters, a key demographic in his 2024 victory, may be eroding primarily due to economic concerns. A New York Times/Sienna poll found that 69% of Hispanics disapprove of his job performance, with a majority believing he has worsened the economy. While this presents an opportunity for Democrats, other surveys suggest the party has not yet made significant gains with this group. Immigration has also risen as a key issue for Latino voters, nearly half of whom now fear that they or a family member could be deported under the administration's policies.</p>
