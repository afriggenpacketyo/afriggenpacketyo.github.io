          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has announced his intention to resign following pressure from Trump administration officials. Sources indicate the pressure stemmed from Siebert's office not bringing mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent political adversary of the president. The departure creates a leadership vacuum in a key prosecutor's office, raising concerns among critics about the politicization of the Justice Department and the pursuit of retribution against political rivals. James has denied any wrongdoing, and her lawyer called the situation a "brazen attack on the rule of law."</p>

          <p>A massive security operation is underway in Glendale, Arizona, for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with over 100,000 people anticipated to attend. Multiple federal agencies, including the FBI and Secret Service, have issued a security bulletin acknowledging "several threats of unknown credibility" against the event, which will be attended by President Trump. The Department of Homeland Security has given the service a SEAR-1 security rating, equivalent to the Super Bowl, prompting an all-hands-on-deck response from local and federal law enforcement who had only a week to prepare for the large-scale gathering.</p>

          <p>A key CDC advisory panel, the ACIP, has voted to change its COVID-19 vaccine guidance, shifting from a broad recommendation to a model of "individual-based decision-making" for most people. This change encourages personal consultation with healthcare providers rather than a universal public health directive. The panel, recently appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also voted to recommend separate MMR and varicella (chickenpox) shots for children under four, citing a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures with the combined MMRV vaccine. A vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule was postponed.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. The final witness, an FBI agent, presented evidence suggesting Routh had been living at a gas station and conducting surveillance for a month prior to the incident. Investigators detailed Routh's internet searches for high-powered weapons and his alleged motive to prevent Trump from being elected. Routh, who is representing himself in the trial, is expected to call three witnesses for his defense next week.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States is "well on its way" following a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. During his remarks, Trump credited the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, stating that Kirk had been a proponent of using the platform to engage with young voters and had helped Republicans achieve significant gains with that demographic.

          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke the broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. This article explains that broadcast networks use public airwaves and are required by the FCC to operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity." While the FCC can revoke licenses, the process is complex and typically involves issues like obscenity or failing to serve local communities. Using this power to punish networks for political content is considered an unprecedented move that would likely face significant legal challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation to raise the application fee for the H-1B visa program, which is designed for highly skilled foreign workers, to $100,000. This new fee, typically paid by employers, is in addition to existing charges and represents a significant increase. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the administration's goal is to incentivize companies to hire and train American workers rather than relying on foreign talent to fill specialized roles. The move marks a major step in the administration's broader efforts to tighten both legal and illegal immigration policies.</p>

He is part of a group of over 2,000 models calling on the government to regulate generative AI, which can create human-like images for campaigns without using real people. Gandy argues that this trend not only threatens the livelihoods of models but also makes entire creative teams, including photographers, makeup artists, and assistants, redundant. He fears that without regulation, AI could irreparably damage the industry and its artistic ecosystem.</p>

The analysis points specifically to NBC cutting ties with him in 2015 over his remarks about immigrants as a pivotal moment, framing the current pressure on networks as a form of political and personal payback. The weaponization of regulatory bodies is presented as a hallmark of this approach.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that his country's forces are conducting a successful counteroffensive in the east, particularly around the city of Pokrovsk. According to Zelenskiy, Ukrainian troops have inflicted heavy losses on Russian forces, disrupting a major planned offensive and recapturing several settlements. Ukraine's top commander reported advances of up to seven kilometers through Russian defenses in the area. The operation is aimed at seizing the initiative in the Donetsk region, which remains the most intense theater of the ongoing war.</p>

The result is being hailed as a "fairytale" and one of the biggest moments in Canadian rugby history.</p>

          <p>This article argues that recent policy changes recommended by the CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) risk creating a two-tiered system for vaccine access in the United States. By altering the childhood immunization schedule and removing certain combination vaccines from federal programs, the panel's decisions could disproportionately affect low-income families. While privately insured individuals may continue to have broad access, children relying on the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program might face new barriers, potentially leading to significant health disparities reminiscent of the pre-VFC era.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has deployed its Typhon missile system to a marine base in Iwakuni, Japan, for the first time in the Asia-Pacific region. The land-based launcher, capable of firing mid-range missiles, is participating in the annual Resolute Dragon joint training exercise with Japanese forces. This deployment is significant as it marks the first time such a weapon has been in the region since the 1987 INF Treaty, which the U.S. withdrew from. The move is seen as a strategic effort to counter regional threats but could also prompt China to accelerate the development of its own counterstrike systems.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, he suggested that the British military could be used to stop asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel. However, UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle rejected this call, stating that the UK Border Force has the specific responsibility for policing the nation's borders. Kyle emphasized that while the navy has a working relationship with the Border Force, the military's primary focus should remain on key national defense issues around the world. The exchange highlights a policy difference between the two allied governments on handling illegal migration.</p>

Convention Center, a project proponents believe will boost tourism and create thousands of jobs. The decision comes despite stark warnings from the city's own policy analysts, who cautioned that the project is a risky bet that will divert an average of $89 million annually from essential city services for the next 30 years. Critics, including the City Controller, argued that the city cannot afford such a massive expenditure amid an ongoing budget crisis and that it could lead to further service cuts.

The union and its supporters accused Disney of censorship and capitulating to political pressure. They were joined in their criticism by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who posted on social media asking, "Where has all the leadership gone?" and calling the suspension an example of "out-of-control intimidation" by the FCC. The backlash reflects growing anger in the creative community over what is seen as an attack on free speech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, characterizing the 85-page filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for being filled with "vituperation and invective" rather than clear legal arguments. However, the dismissal is not final, as the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a shorter, more focused complaint that adheres to legal standards. Trump responded to the news by asserting, "I'm winning, I'm winning the cases," and attacking the reporting of ABC News.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the White House has indicated that significant progress has been made toward a deal for TikTok, but a final agreement is not yet in place. Trump later told reporters that a deal is "well on its way" and that getting it signed could be a "formality." The proposed framework would see the popular video app's U.S. operations divested to American investors to allay national security concerns. The negotiations are ongoing as Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to complete the sale.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a U.S. government shutdown has increased significantly after the Senate failed to advance a short-term funding bill that had narrowly passed the House. With the October 1 funding deadline looming, lawmakers are leaving Washington for a recess without a clear path to an agreement. The Republican-led House bill would fund the government until November 21, but Senate Democrats opposed it, citing a lack of negotiation over their priorities. The political stalemate leaves the government on the brink of a lapse in funding, with both sides blaming the other for the impasse.</p>
