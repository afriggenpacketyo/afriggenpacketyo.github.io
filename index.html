          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has temporarily halted Democratic self-reflection on his presidency and 2024 candidacy. While many express sympathy, some Democrats, including former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the timing is a deflection from growing criticism within the party about his age and performance. The article highlights the complicated mix of concern and lingering doubts about the transparency surrounding Biden's health during his time in office, with some physicians questioning when he first learned about his condition. The situation underscores the altered legacy of his decision to run for re-election as the oldest president in history and the ongoing debate about loyalty versus national interest within both political parties.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election has failed to produce a decisive outcome, resulting in another minority government led by the center-right Democratic Alliance. This continues a period of political instability in the country, marking the third election in three years. The rise of the hard-right populist party Chega adds further uncertainty, as they now hold a significant number of seats in the National Assembly. The election was triggered by a vote of no confidence, sparked by conflicts of interest allegations against Prime Minister LuÃ­s Montenegro's family law firm, and key issues include corruption scandals, immigration policies, and a housing crisis affecting the Portuguese population.</p>

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their daughter from her paedophile father has expressed disappointment with a new government bill. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they abused their own children. This limitation means families in similar situations may still need to go through costly family court proceedings. The family had previously spent over Â£30,000 to protect their daughter, highlighting the financial burden of navigating the legal system to safeguard children from abusive parents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article argues that the Trump administration's reluctance to fully engage in the Ukraine conflict could embolden Russia and destabilize Europe. The author, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, contends that President Putin's ambitions extend beyond Ukraine and aim to reshape the post-Cold War order. She suggests that a weak peace agreement in Ukraine would leave Europe vulnerable and create opportunities for Russia to challenge American interests globally. The article warns that Moscow is already employing tactics such as sabotage and cyberattacks to undermine European resistance and that a larger conflict in Europe would negatively impact the U.S. economy and security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government initiated its first voluntary deportation flight, sending 68 migrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their home countries. The Trump administration is offering $1,000 debit cards and the possibility of future legal entry to encourage self-deportation. While some migrants, like Kevin Antonio Posadas, are taking advantage of the offer to return to their families, experts remain skeptical about the program's widespread appeal. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem emphasized that those who do not self-deport face fines, arrest, and permanent exclusion from the U.S., while the Honduran government is also providing support to returning migrants.</p>

The vehicle-borne improvised explosive device he used caused significant damage, and the blast was felt over a mile away. While four others were injured, all embryos stored at the clinic were saved.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a two-year low of 3.85%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects the country's receding inflation concerns, with the latest headline inflation figure at a four-year low of 2.4%. While the RBA aims to maintain inflation within its target range of 2% to 3%, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. The Australian economy has shown some recovery, with a recent GDP expansion, but analysts highlight potential downside risks from global trade tensions and domestic economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will pay nearly $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed during the January 6, 2021, Capitol breach. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disagreement with the Justice Department's decision to settle the wrongful death claim. Babbitt's death has been a rallying point for Trump loyalists, and the lawsuit alleged that U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in the use of force.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, along with the French and Canadian leaders, has joined in condemning Israel's actions in Gaza, calling for an immediate end to military operations and the allowance of humanitarian aid. The leaders criticized the denial of essential assistance to civilians as unacceptable and potentially breaching International Humanitarian Law. They also called for Hamas to release the remaining hostages taken during the October 7, 2023, attack. Benjamin Netanyahu responded by accusing the leaders of offering a "huge prize" for Hamas.</p>

          <p>Shares of CATL, the worldâ€™s biggest maker of batteries for electric cars, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from buying its stock. This restriction underscores the deepening financial rift between the United States and China, with CATL caught in the crossfire of sanctions and blacklists. While most large American institutions can still trade in CATL shares through offshore accounts, the move is seen as a significant milestone towards full financial decoupling, potentially excluding U.S. investors from profitable opportunities in Chinese hardware and software production.</p>
