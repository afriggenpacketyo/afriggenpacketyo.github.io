          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a decline after the company announced price cuts on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June, with the Seagull hatchback's price reduced by 20% and the Seal sedan's price cut by 34%. Citi analysts anticipate that BYD's price reductions will result in a significant increase in foot traffic at its dealerships, while other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline due to investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Despite the price cuts, Citi analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies priced below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

          <p>Three more inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail earlier in May have been captured, as announced by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, with Lenton Vanburen detained in Baton Rouge and Leo Tate and Jermaine Donald arrested in Walker County, Texas. These individuals will face additional charges related to the escape, adding to their original incarcerations for offenses such as parole violation, burglary, and second-degree murder. At least nine people have been arrested for allegedly assisting the escapees, including a maintenance worker accused of disabling the water supply to a cell involved in the jailbreak. The 10 inmates escaped by forcing open a cell door and breaching a wall, with their absence unnoticed for several hours.</p>

          <p>Tennessee Representative Andy Ogles is requesting a federal investigation into Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell's policies regarding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, claiming they amount to "aiding and abetting illegal immigration."

This announcement follows a recent ICE operation in Nashville that led to the arrest of nearly 200 illegal immigrants, with the Department of Homeland Security criticizing O'Connell's earlier comments expressing concern that such actions make the community less safe.</p>

          <p>A House bill aims to cut in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the market for team ownership. The legislation would limit the deduction of "intangible assets," such as player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years, a tax break that has fueled rising team values. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would raise nearly $1 billion over 10 years. The White House claims the measure seeks to eliminate an unfair advantage for owners amid rising ticket prices.</p>

Saporito criticizes the president's demand that companies like Walmart "eat the tariffs," pointing out that this would disrupt their business models and potentially lead to bankruptcies. He also notes that some companies are avoiding the word "tariff" altogether, instead using more neutral terms like "sourcing cost" or "supply chain cost," which Saporito argues is a disservice to consumers.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, the longtime congressman from Harlem, passed away at the age of 94, leaving behind a legacy of service to his community and the nation. Rangel, a Korean War veteran and member of the "Gang of Four," represented Harlem in Congress for over four decades and became the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Friends and residents remember him as a down-to-earth figure who remained committed to his Harlem roots throughout his career, with G.

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets rising to a record high. The Finance Ministry attributed this shift partly to the weaker yen, which boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, but also to Germany's large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased significantly, but remained below Germany's total, while the United States has a net external liability, with foreign debts exceeding overseas assets.</p>
