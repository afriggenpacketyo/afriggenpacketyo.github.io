          <p>Individuals and organizations aligned with President Trump are requesting free legal work from law firms that made pro bono commitments to the White House. These commitments were made in exchange for being spared from executive orders that could have hurt their businesses. Veterans, in particular, are reaching out to firms like Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The law firms are now navigating how to fulfill these commitments while maintaining their autonomy and not alienating their staff.</p>

Johnson dismissed concerns about conflicts of interest and lack of disclosure, asserting that Trump is the most transparent president in history. Trump's crypto ventures have raised ethics concerns among Senate Democrats, who have pushed for greater transparency. Johnson played a key role in passing Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" through the House.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Man City midfielder, Jack Grealish. There does not appear to be any way back for Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips and Maximo Perrone, who have all been out on loan this season. Guardiola signed defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis in January which could spell the end for the injury-prone duo of John Stones and Nathan Ake. One player they won't be moving for - at this stage - is Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz owning to the cost of doing a deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White remains of interest while AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders has been heavily linked, external with a move to Etihad Stadium.</p>

          <p>US federal judges are contemplating establishing their own armed security force, shifting control from the Department of Justice due to concerns about political interference. The proposal emerged amidst increasing threats against judges, fueled by the Trump administration's criticism of court rulings. Judges fear that the administration might compromise their protection, prompting discussions about transferring the US Marshals Service under the judiciary's direct control.
