          <p>A shooting in Manhattan's Times Square has left three people injured, including two innocent bystanders. The New York Police Department reported that the incident occurred early Saturday morning after a fight involving a group of teenagers spilled out of a restaurant. A 17-year-old suspect was quickly apprehended and has been charged with attempted murder, as police say the intended target was among those shot. The other victims, an 18-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man, were hospitalized in stable condition. Authorities recovered a firearm from the scene and are continuing to investigate the circumstances leading to the violence.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance engaged in high-stakes diplomatic discussions in the United Kingdom with European allies and Ukrainian officials. The meeting occurred just a day after President Trump announced a planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The talks in the UK, described as producing 'significant progress,' aimed to address European and Ukrainian concerns about being excluded from the direct U.S.-Russia negotiations. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has insisted that any peace process must involve Ukraine directly at the negotiating table, a sentiment echoed by other European leaders.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Honolulu, Hawaii, are searching for a suspect who threw sulfuric acid on a 30-year-old man, leaving him in critical condition. The unprovoked attack occurred Friday night in the Chinatown area as the victim was crossing the street. Witnesses described the suspect approaching the man and throwing an unknown liquid, later identified as the highly corrosive chemical, into his face. The victim's severe injuries have prevented detectives from interviewing him, and the motive for the assault remains unknown. Police are canvassing for surveillance footage to identify the suspect, who was last seen wearing a blue shirt and carrying a red bottle.</p>

          <p>Jen Pawol has officially broken a significant barrier in professional sports, becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game. Her historic debut took place during the first game of a doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she served as the first base umpire. The 48-year-old, who has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016, was met with a warm ovation from the crowd and support from players and managers. Following the game, Pawol donated the cap she wore during her debut to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kentucky's bourbon industry is facing a significant downturn after a period of booming growth, driven by a combination of economic pressures and shifting consumer habits. Post-pandemic inflation and the declining interest of younger generations in alcohol have slowed sales considerably. The situation has been exacerbated by global trade disputes, particularly retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada, which have severely impacted exports for major brands like Jack Daniel's and Bulleit. This economic strain has led to bankruptcies and consolidations among distilleries, creating an oversupply in a market that was once thriving on premium and collectible bottles.

In a letter from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the administration accused Harvard of violating legal requirements tied to these funds and initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action is the latest in an ongoing conflict where the administration has accused the university of civil rights violations over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests. Critics suggest these moves are a pretext to assert federal control over academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The booming market for functional beverages, which promise benefits like relaxation and stress relief, is facing questions about the validity of its health claims. While brands like Trip advertise ingredients such as L-theanine and Lion's Mane mushroom to promote a sense of calm, nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical. Experts point out that the quantities of these supplements in the drinks are often far lower than the amounts used in clinical studies, making significant effects unlikely. Psychologists suggest that any perceived calming effect may be a placebo, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself with a special beverage rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>In the Peruvian settlement of Pampa Clemesí, residents live in darkness just a short distance from the country's largest solar complex. The Rubí and Clemesí solar plants generate enough electricity to power over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers remain disconnected from the national grid. While the plant's operator has invested in infrastructure to bring power to the village, the final connection to individual homes is a government responsibility that has been stalled. This paradox highlights a broader issue in Peru, where energy infrastructure development often prioritizes profitability over connecting remote, sparsely populated communities, leaving them without basic services.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about the nature of identity in 2025. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish parent, defended his connection to the country, but his comments drew some criticism online. This article explores the evolving and complex definitions of Irishness, which can encompass heritage, cultural immersion, and personal feeling, rather than just place of birth. The discussion touches upon the blended identities common in the UK, the nuances within Northern Ireland, and the historical cross-fertilization of cultures between the two islands.</p>

Film enthusiasts and critics argue that an earnestly made but failed movie can be more entertaining and memorable than a bland, forgettable blockbuster.

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's annual atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time is being seen as a potential test for improving China-Japan relations. Lee Yi-yang, who heads Taiwan's de facto embassy in Japan, was present at the events, marking a significant step in Taiwan's efforts to strengthen unofficial ties with Tokyo and boost its international visibility. While Beijing is expected to view the participation unfavorably, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid undermining their recent diplomatic progress. The move follows a rare visit to Japan by Taiwan's foreign minister.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego received an enthusiastic reception at a town hall in Iowa as he criticized the Republican-backed tax bill, energizing Democratic activists. Gallego argued the legislation would make America "poorer and sicker," a message that resonated with the crowd of several hundred. The event reflects a broader Democratic strategy to go on the offensive against the bill, viewing it as a major political liability for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. By focusing on issues like cuts to Medicaid, Democrats are aiming to frame the legislation as beneficial only to the wealthy at the expense of working-class families.</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Wilton officials claim they were unaware of Dawn Norton's second, $210,000-a-year job and that it would not have been approved. However, Norton contends that she had been working remotely for Wilton while on family medical leave and had kept town leadership fully informed of her new role. The discovery came amid a review of Wilton's Finance Department, which had been facing issues including understaffing and audit findings of "material weakness."</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be removed from the country right away, with the destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The Ministry of Justice states this would save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign nationals comprise about 12% of the prison population. The opposition has criticized the plan, warning that some countries may simply refuse to accept the deported criminals, potentially allowing them to go free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist suggests that pomegranates are a highly beneficial fruit for people over 50 seeking to support healthy brain aging. Rich in polyphenols, pomegranates provide powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from amyloid proteins, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and are not available year-round, pomegranate extract can be an alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugars. The article also notes that other fruits like blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados offer significant cognitive benefits.</p>

The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban as necessary for national security, human rights groups like Amnesty International described the mass arrests as a disproportionate and concerning threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. The IRS had informed the administration that it could not legally provide most of the requested information on a list of 40,000 individuals, citing taxpayer privacy rights. The White House has been pushing federal agencies to share data to aid its immigration crackdown, but Long's resistance appears to have led to his removal after just two months. The incident raises concerns about political pressure being applied to independent government agencies to conform to administration priorities.</p>
