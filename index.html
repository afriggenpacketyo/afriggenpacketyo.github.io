This mission marks the 12th crewed flight for SpaceX under NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which continues to provide reliable transportation to the orbiting laboratory as plans for the ISS's retirement proceed.</p>

          <p>In a significant move to ease tensions, North Korea has started removing propaganda loudspeakers from its border with South Korea. This action follows South Korea's decision to dismantle its own speakers and halt anti-Pyongyang broadcasts under its new presidential administration. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and critical messages, had recently escalated after a yearslong pause, contributing to heightened animosity alongside North Korea's military activities and weapons testing.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the upcoming summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that any peace deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that his country will not concede land to end the conflict. His comments come amid concerns that a bilateral meeting could marginalize Kyiv's interests, particularly after Trump suggested a potential deal could involve a "swapping of territories."</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 200 demonstrators in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw numerous individuals display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." This mass arrest occurred just days after the first individuals were formally charged for supporting the group, which the government banned following acts of significant criminal damage attributed to its activists.</p>

          <p>The Democratic party is shifting its strategy to more aggressively combat Republican political maneuvers, particularly in response to President Trump's push for partisan gerrymandering in states like Texas. Departing from Michelle Obama's 'when they go high, we go high' motto, prominent Democrats are now advocating for fighting 'fire with fire,' including pursuing their own redistricting efforts in blue states. This tactical evolution reflects a growing sentiment within the party that a more pugnacious approach is necessary to protect democratic processes against what they view as authoritarian threats.</p>

          <p>According to a recent Charles Schwab survey, Americans believe a net worth of $2.3 million is required to be considered wealthy in 2025, a figure that varies significantly by region. Residents in the West cite the highest threshold at $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. The survey also found that many people define wealth in non-financial terms like happiness and relationships, and that the benchmark for feeling financially 'comfortable' is a more attainable $839,000 on average.

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a revival by replacing defunct department stores with a diverse mix of non-retail tenants. Instead of traditional anchors, landlords are bringing in entities like churches, entertainment complexes, large-format bookstores, and even residential apartments to transform malls into community hubs. This strategy is proving successful, driving new foot traffic and creating 'cross-shopping' opportunities that are helping to revitalize these once-declining suburban staples and improve their financial performance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to open 82% of the 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) to oil and gas drilling, rolling back previous protections. The proposal has triggered a massive public outcry, with conservation groups and Alaska Native communities expressing alarm over the immense threat to one of the world's fastest-warming ecosystems. Critics argue the move erases years of collaborative work to protect critical wildlife habitats for polar bears and caribou and undermines the subsistence rights of local Indigenous peoples.</p>

          <p>With concert ticket prices soaring, a growing number of consumers, particularly younger generations, are using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans to afford live events. A recent survey found that 23% of Americans have used these installment plans for concert costs. Financial analysts caution against this trend, advising fans to proactively create dedicated savings funds, like a 'Beyoncé fund,' to cover these expenses, thereby avoiding potential late fees and the risks associated with short-term debt.

          <p>After a teenage football player in New Jersey experienced debilitating concussion symptoms for months without improvement, doctors discovered he had a rare, underlying condition. An MRI revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain, which was likely the true cause of his severe headaches and other symptoms. Following a successful surgery to remove the AVM, the teen has made a full recovery and is raising awareness about the importance of thorough diagnostic imaging for persistent post-concussion issues.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons generated during the nuclear fusion process. The speculative idea is not to get rich from gold, but to use the revenue from selling the precious metal to offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion, a potential source of near-limitless clean energy. While scientifically plausible, the concept hinges on the future viability of commercial fusion reactors, which remain a decade or more away.</p>

          <p>Two decades after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor workers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. A recent state audit and a review of fatality cases reveal significant lapses in enforcement by Cal/OSHA, the state's workplace safety agency. Advocates argue that a lack of inspectors, outdated procedures, and a failure to penalize non-compliant employers have rendered the law ineffective, leaving vulnerable workers at extreme risk, especially during increasingly intense summer heat waves.</p>

Her meticulous analysis of financial records and operational activities was instrumental in identifying Ames, whose espionage led to the execution of numerous CIA assets within the USSR.</p>
