Williams and his wife Wendy believe around 400 veterans were similarly affected, and they have sought support from MPs and official bodies.

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack deep into Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, as it prepares for another round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian security sources claim the attack, "Operation Spider's Web," took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by President Zelenskyy. The drones hit airfields, including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, and Ukraine alleges the operation destroyed 34% of Russia's fleet of air missile carriers. The drone attack coincided with reports of a Russian military strike killing at least 12 soldiers at a Ukrainian army training site, and explosions caused two bridges to collapse and derail two trains in western Russia.
