          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at judges, emphasizing how it can lead to threats and violence. Speaking at a judicial conference, he referenced past instances involving both Republican and Democratic leaders without naming them directly, alluding to comments from President Trump and Senator Chuck Schumer. Roberts stressed that such statements undermine the judicial process and that political leaders must recognize the potential for their words to incite harm against judges who are simply doing their jobs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the scientific phenomenon known as the "urban heat island" effect, which causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while a lack of vegetation and water sources limits natural cooling processes, leading to higher temperatures, especially at night. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, this effect makes growing urban populations particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and related health risks.</p>

          <p>Following its 12-day war with Israel, the Iranian regime has escalated its domestic crackdown, executing six men on espionage charges and arresting over 700 people accused of ties to Israel. Human rights activists express grave concern, stating the accused were denied due process and that the government is using the post-war situation to instill fear and silence dissent. This wave of repression, which includes increased online surveillance, has deepened anxieties among Iranians who fear the regime is taking revenge on its own people.</p>
