          <p>A 15-year-old boy has tragically died after an incident in the River Kelvin in Glasgow, during what was Scotland's hottest day in two years. Emergency services recovered his body late Saturday night, and police are treating the death as accidental and not suspicious. The event occurred as many people flocked to outdoor locations to escape the heat. On the same day, a 63-year-old woman also died after a fall near a waterfall in a separate incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. This initiative aims to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban on their sale. Additionally, the government plans to invest £63 million in charging infrastructure, including funding for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The specific details of the affordability measures are expected to be revealed later in the week.</p>

The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, stating there was a "technical error" that caused a munition to miss its intended target, an Islamic Jihad militant, and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians. The incident is currently under review by the Israeli military.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England on Saturday. Amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions, warning of potential health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heat has led to hosepipe bans in some areas and an "extreme" wildfire warning in Scotland. The Met Office forecasts that the heatwave will begin to break on Monday, bringing cooler temperatures and rain to many parts of the country.</p>

These options can include topical anesthetics and nerve blocks, aiming to make the highly effective contraceptive method more tolerable for patients.

This approach is evident in the state's response to past events like Hurricane Ike and the 2021 winter storm, where calls for major infrastructure improvements like the "Ike Dike" or grid winterization have seen slow or incomplete action.

The attack, which killed firefighter Corey Comperatore, exposed lapses in intelligence sharing, event coordination, and communication with local law enforcement. In response, the Secret Service has outlined 37 reform measures, but experts note that the agency has faced budget and staffing constraints for years, issues that were flagged in reports long before the shooting. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the consequences when a "zero-fail mission" is not matched with sufficient resources and support.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, this article examines the profound and lasting impact the event had on U.S. politics. Trump's survival and defiant response, raising a bloodied fist to the crowd, galvanized his supporters and was framed by many as an act of divine intervention, shaping his second term with a sense of zealous destiny. The shooting also occurred just before President Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 race, creating a devastating political contrast and contributing to a chaotic election cycle. The event is viewed as a pivotal moment that solidified Trump's image and continues to influence the national political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Relations between China and India are strained following a dispute over the succession plan for the 14th Dalai Lama. The conflict was sparked by an Indian minister's comment that only the Dalai Lama and his institution can identify his successor, followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to the exiled spiritual leader. Beijing responded with sharp criticism, lodging a formal protest and insisting that the reincarnation process must adhere to Chinese law and tradition. This diplomatic friction threatens a recent, fragile thaw in relations between the two neighboring powers.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into living jellyfish, allowing them to be remotely controlled for ocean monitoring. These cyborg jellyfish can be directed to swim and collect environmental data on temperature and pressure, offering a low-cost and scalable alternative to conventional underwater robots. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. The research aims to make ocean data collection more accessible and could redefine how we study marine environments.</p>

          <p>This opinion article uses the new "Superman" movie as a lens to critique the current state of American politics, arguing that real-life heroes with moral courage are sorely lacking. The author points to the recent passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill," highlighting several Republican fiscal hawks who voted for the legislation despite previously condemning its deficit spending. The piece criticizes this as an act of political cowardice and self-interest, contrasting it with the classic American ideal of "Truth, Justice, and the American Way." The author suggests that politicians have traded enduring public good for flimsy fame and political expediency.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing affordability and homelessness crises, California is creating a new cabinet-level state agency dedicated solely to these issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to provide a more focused approach. Supporters believe this will elevate the housing agenda to the highest level of state government and hope it is a first step toward simplifying the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. The new agency is set to officially launch on July 1, 2026.</p>

          <p>The job market for the class of 2025 is proving to be exceptionally challenging, with many recent college graduates struggling to find work in their desired fields. Economists note that while overall unemployment is low, cautious hiring by employers and job cuts in sectors like government and tech have reduced opportunities for entry-level workers. A survey by ZipRecruiter found a significant gap between the salary expectations of graduates and the actual pay they are receiving. Experts advise graduates to be flexible, as even a first job that is not ideal can provide valuable skills and serve as a stepping stone.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country has risen to 129, with search and recovery efforts still underway for missing individuals. The disaster was triggered by extreme rainfall that caused the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically. In response to the tragedy, volunteer groups, including former Navy SEALs, are assisting in the difficult search through miles of debris. President Donald Trump, when questioned about the effectiveness of the state's warning systems, praised the heroic response and dismissed such questions as inappropriate.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an attempt to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, set for late July, is part of an ongoing dispute over pay, with doctors arguing that a proposed 5.4% raise is insufficient to restore real-terms pay lost since 2008. The government has stated it cannot improve the offer, but the BMA expressed hope that constructive discussions could lead to a solution. Public support for the strikes has reportedly declined since last year.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York. The rock is estimated to sell for between $2 million and $4 million. It is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for peace in the region. The PKK is demanding the release of its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and amnesty for its fighters as part of a sustainable peace deal. While Turkey's government has called the move an opportunity, it remains cautious, waiting to see if the disarmament is genuine. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and enhance its status in the Middle East.</p>
