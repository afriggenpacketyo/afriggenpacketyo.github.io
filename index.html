          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, has named eight new advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, following the dismissal of the previous 17 members. Kennedy's selections include individuals with a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations, such as Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines. These picks circumvent the usual CDC process, raising concerns about the influence of political leaders over scientific advice. The panel's recommendations are influential, directly impacting federal policies regarding vaccine coverage. Optimism surrounding the situation is low, given the potential impact on public health policy.</p>

          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, former executives of the sexual wellness company OneTaste, have been convicted of forced labor conspiracy. They were found guilty of manipulating young women into performing degrading sex acts for the company's benefit, including sexually servicing potential investors. Prosecutors accused the executives of recruiting people with prior trauma and subjecting them to constant surveillance and intimidation. Daedone and Cherwitz face up to 20 years in prison for their crimes, which involved coercing employees into working long hours with little to no pay and intimidating them into financial ruin to pay for expensive OneTaste courses and retreats. This is a victory for the victims of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>All 12 members of the board overseeing the Fulbright scholarships have resigned, protesting the Trump administration's alleged interference in the selection of award recipients. The board members stated that the administration denied awards to numerous individuals already chosen for the international exchange program. They also cited an unauthorized review process for 1,200 foreign award recipients, potentially leading to their rejection. The board members believe these actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence.

          <p>The UK chancellor's Spending Review is dominating newspaper headlines, with varied reactions ranging from "renewing Britain" to "reckless splurge." The NHS and defense are highlighted as "big winners," but some critics warn of potential tax increases to balance the books. Some reports indicate that the police and defense face a challenging fiscal situation despite increased spending. The review is seen by some as a rejection of austerity, while others suggest it will lead to long-term financial burdens for voters. The newspapers reflect a divided perspective on the economic implications of the government's spending plans.</p>

The two had a public fallout after Musk stepped back from his White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, on claims that he is a threat to US foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled. However, Khalil can still remain in custody based on claims that he inaccurately filled out his green card application. Khalil has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March, missing the birth of his first child. His arrest was the first in a wave of arrests of students as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism in US universities.</p>
