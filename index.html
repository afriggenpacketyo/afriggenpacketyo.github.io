          <p>Representative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, appeared on "Face the Nation" to discuss critical policy matters. He strongly condemned gerrymandering, proposing a national ban and term limits to address the lack of competitive districts and reform a dysfunctional Congress. Lawler also criticized New York Democrats for failing to tackle rising crime, advocating for federal support while stressing the importance of prosecuting gun crimes at the local level. Additionally, he expressed conservative reservations about government acquiring ownership stakes in private companies like Intel, even while acknowledging the national security imperatives for domestic semiconductor manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has vehemently denied rumors of his imminent resignation, calling such talk "absurd" after the team's 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace. However, he stopped short of guaranteeing his continued tenure beyond the summer transfer window, revealing ongoing discussions with owner Evangelos Marinakis and global head of football Edu regarding transfer needs, particularly for a new goalkeeper and full-backs. Reports indicate a strained relationship between Nuno and Marinakis over transfer strategy, with some experts suggesting the manager's public comments could jeopardize his position. Despite this, the fanbase has shown strong support for Nuno, who guided Forest to their highest Premier League standing in decades last season.</p>

          <p>Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir Technologies employee, argues that the company's AI-powered intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (Istar) systems pose significant, invisible dangers to civil liberties. These tools, used by agencies like ICE and the IDF, combine vast public and private data to track, detain, and target individuals, violating First and Fourth Amendment rights through mass surveillance and warrantless data collection. Pinto, now an activist, highlights how these systems are used against vulnerable populations and are increasingly adopted in the private sector for behavioral shaping. He advocates for a renewed focus on privacy and stronger AI consumer protections to counter this pervasive threat.</p>

Grealish, seeking to impress England coach Thomas Tuchel for a World Cup spot, provided two assists in 52 minutes, matching his total from the previous two Premier League seasons. His impactful play, characterized by direct runs and defensive contributions, earned him a standing ovation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England governor, highlighted Britain's "acute challenge" stemming from weak economic growth and a post-pandemic decline in its workforce. He cited a rise in long-term sickness and fewer young people in employment, exacerbated by an aging population, as key factors. Bailey stressed the urgent need to boost economic productivity, noting the UK's low labor force participation compared to other advanced economies. This article explains that reduced participation contributes to fears that Britain's inflation rate, the highest in the G7, will be slow to return to its 2% target, despite recent GDP growth.

          <p>Internal Jesuit correspondence from the 1970s and 80s reveals that numerous officials were aware of Donald B. Dickerson's history of sexually assaulting children but allowed him to be ordained as a priest. Despite warnings from some superiors, Dickerson continued to sexually assault minors, including an alleged sexual assault at Loyola University New Orleans in 1984, which is now the subject of a lawsuit. This article highlights how concerns were dismissed and his ordination proceeded, leading to multiple subsequent allegations and lawsuits after his laicization.
