          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and X can go to trial, denying attempts to move or dismiss the case. Lemon sued after X terminated a partnership for a new show following a contentious interview with Musk. The lawsuit alleges fraud and breach of an implied contract. The judge found Lemon's claims plausible, setting the stage for a legal battle over the canceled deal, which was scrapped just hours after the interview was recorded.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to meet with President Trump, a significant event as Nvidia recently became the first company to close with a market valuation over $4 trillion. The meeting's agenda is unconfirmed but is expected to address U.S. export controls on AI chips, which have impacted Nvidia's sales to China. The Trump administration has been reviewing these policies, creating uncertainty for the chipmaker's access to the substantial Chinese market. The discussion will likely be crucial for navigating future trade and national security regulations affecting the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing strong business performance that helps offset the impact of new tariffs. The denim company plans to absorb the initial $25-30 million in tariff-related costs, but this strategy may change depending on evolving U.S. trade policies. The company's updated forecast, which beat analyst expectations, assumes a 30% tariff on its minimal China production and a 10% tariff elsewhere. Strong consumer demand and a shift towards premium, full-price products are providing a buffer against these new economic headwinds.</p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space to crystallize drugs that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of its space flights and expand its on-ground labs to prepare more complex molecules for in-space production. Varda has already successfully launched several missions and became the first company to receive FAA approval to return a space-manufactured drug product to Earth.</p>

          <p>An ICE official testified that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported earlier this year, if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia is currently in U.S. custody facing human trafficking charges, and a judge previously ruled he could be released on bond. The Justice Department, however, has indicated it would seek to remove him to a "third country," creating legal uncertainty. His lawyers are fighting to ensure he receives due process and is not "spirited away again" without a proper hearing.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to "segment" its premium cabins, potentially creating different tiers of business and first-class fares, similar to how it structured its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, stated that the goal is to cater to the different needs of premium travelers, though he did not provide specific details on what these new options might entail. The move comes as revenue from high-end seats has been a significant growth area for the airline. This strategy could follow industry trends of offering ultra-luxurious suites or more basic, unbundled premium fares.</p>
