          <p>Overnight Russian strikes across Ukraine resulted in at least seven deaths and 41 injuries, targeting both civilian and energy infrastructure. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was particularly hard hit, with strikes killing three and injuring 21, including an infant and a teenager. Strikes also impacted Kherson and Donetsk Oblasts, causing additional casualties. Ukrainian authorities reported that Russia launched 215 projectiles, including drones and missiles, with 174 neutralized by the Ukrainian Air Force. These attacks have intensified pressure on Moscow to cease its aggression and strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities. The situation reflects the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 concludes its inaugural Washington, D.C. celebration with a weekend parade, marking 50 years of Pride events in the city. Despite the scale of the festivities, organizers note a dampened enthusiasm due to the current political environment, particularly executive orders limiting trans rights. Several corporate sponsors declined to support the event in response to President Trump's executive order targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the finale weekend sparked backlash from local officials, who viewed it as a controversial move. Despite these challenges, law enforcement is preparing for a large celebration.</p>

          <p>Despite bipartisan concerns about fiscal responsibility, the US national debt continues to climb, and Trump's policies are expected to exacerbate the issue. Tax cuts pushed by Trump are projected to add trillions to the debt, drawing criticism from economists and some Republican senators. Moody's recently downgraded the US credit rating, citing concerns about rising deficits and interest costs. The debt ceiling, a limit on federal borrowing, has repeatedly sparked legislative battles. Ray Dalio warned of a potential crisis within three years, likening the situation to a "heart attack." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving flexibility. These exercises include foot doming, wall stretches, toe spreads, toe yoga, calf raises, and foot massages. Foot doming targets the "foot core," while wall stretches relieve pain and increase blood flow. Toe spreads and toe yoga improve flexibility and balance, while calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles. The article suggests consulting with a healthcare provider for questions or pre-existing foot conditions. By incorporating these exercises into a daily routine, individuals can improve foot health and reduce the risk of injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Georgia case involving a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support has sparked debate over the state's fetal 'personhood' law. Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse, was put on life support after suffering complications during pregnancy, leading doctors to maintain her life support to protect the fetus. The law, which grants fetuses the same rights as a person, has raised questions about whether removing Smith from life support would be equivalent to aborting the fetus. While some officials argue the law does not require maintaining life support in such cases, others disagree, highlighting the complex implications of fetal personhood laws on medical decisions and patient autonomy. The case underscores concerns about the impact of such laws on maternal care and reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe that store prices for rice are "too high." More than 40% of respondents worry that consumers may start avoiding rice due to the elevated cost, which has doubled over the past year. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers in an attempt to curb prices. Kazushi Saito suggests a reasonable price for both producers and consumers would be 3,000 yen per 5 kg. The survey highlights concerns about high farming costs and the potential for overproduction leading to price drops.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. New figures show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers. The Home Office said it is committed to ending asylum hotels and speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. The scale of aid spending on asylum hotels has meant huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world.</p>

However, Russia will maintain its presence in Mali through the Africa Corps, a paramilitary force also controlled by Russia. Wagner stated that it has successfully brought all of the country's regional centers back under the control of the Malian military junta. The Africa Corps, formed with the Russian Defense Ministry's support, is largely composed of former Wagner mercenaries and will continue to operate in the country.</p>

          <p>Cameroon is facing a severely neglected refugee crisis, marked by a significant disparity between the gravity of the situation and the political and media attention it receives. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) ranks Cameroon as the most neglected displacement crisis in the world, citing low scores in media attention, political will, and aid funding. More than 1.1 million people are internally displaced, and there are 480,000 refugees from other countries. The country is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western part and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants.</p>

Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, criticized the measure as discriminatory and a violation of international law. The ban, which takes effect on June 9, targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The US is home to the largest Iranian community outside Iran, with approximately 1.5 million Iranians residing in the country.</p>
