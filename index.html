          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's birth rate fell below 700,000 for the first time in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year. This decline underscores the ongoing trend of delayed marriages and childbirths in the country. The total fertility rate also reached a record low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, and both the number of births and the fertility rate have been decreasing for nine consecutive years, outpacing government projections by 15 years. While the number of marriages saw a slight increase, the number of deaths reached a postwar high, resulting in a record natural decrease in population, highlighting the urgent need for effective measures to address Japan's demographic challenges. The lowest fertility rate was recorded in Tokyo, while Okinawa had the highest. Optimism regarding Japan's demographic future is notably tempered by these figures.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who is receiving "lifesaving medical treatment" in the United States, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the country. Sofia suffers from "short bowel syndrome," which prevents her from properly absorbing nutrients and fluid from food on her own, requiring specialized IV treatments administered up to 14 hours a day. Her lawyers emphasized that this treatment is only available in the United States. The decision came after the Department of Homeland Security initially sent letters terminating their humanitarian parole, raising concerns about the systemic challenges faced by immigrants seeking critical medical care. The situation garnered international attention and pressure from elected officials, highlighting the need for immigration system reforms to protect those facing life-threatening harm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could harm steel producers outside the US, provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American users of these metals. The UK has been granted an exemption, maintaining duties at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors that rely on steel and aluminum, potentially offsetting any gains in the steel industry, and that the US economy is also facing damage, as prices rise as a result of the new measures.

Musk, who previously served as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, expressed concerns that the bill would significantly increase the national debt. The bill, known as the "Big Beautiful Bill," aims to extend tax breaks while cutting social benefits. Surprisingly, Senator Bernie Sanders, a frequent critic of Trump, echoed Musk's sentiments, denouncing the bill for providing tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while cutting food aid for the impoverished.</p>

          <p>Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of patients following heart operations at Castle Hill Hospital, an NHS facility, after documents revealed potential avoidable harm. The documents suggest that some patients' death certificates did not accurately reflect the role of the procedures in their deaths, and families were not fully informed about what happened. One specific case involved an 87-year-old woman whose operation went awry due to the use of an inappropriate access site, resulting in significant complications and her subsequent death, with the hospital's initial investigation downplaying the severity of the incident. The investigation encompasses 11 patients who underwent TAVI procedures, with concerns raised about the hospital's mortality rate being three times higher than the national average at the time.</p>

          <p>A recent drone attack by Ukraine on military airfields and critical assets inside Russia has highlighted the vulnerability of even the most advanced militaries to inexpensive drone technology. The operation, dubbed Operation Spiderâ€™s Web, involved smuggling over 100 explosive-laden drones across the border, evading air defenses, and damaging or destroying over 40 high-value aircraft. This successful attack has demonstrated that inexpensive technology can inflict serious damage against a well-funded adversary, and it serves as a warning to military bases, ports, and command headquarters worldwide. The innovative use of drones is likely to inspire similar asymmetric attacks in the future, altering the landscape of modern warfare.</p>

          <p>More than 15 former Indiana men's basketball players have alleged improper sexual conduct by a former team physician, Dr. Bradford Bomba, including claims that university officials and the late coach Bobby Knight were aware of the doctor's behavior. The players allege that Bomba regularly performed unnecessary rectal exams during physicals and that their complaints were ignored. The university commissioned an investigation that found Bomba's exams were performed appropriately, but some players contradict this finding, with one alleging that Bomba "fondled his genitalia" during a physical. Despite the university's findings, the allegations have led to legal action and scrutiny of the university's handling of the situation.</p>

The deal involves a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at 16,300 yen apiece, lower than the previous closing price, with financing backed by loans from multiple banks.

          <p>Denmark's decision to ban the question of Palestine from national school elections highlights a contradiction in the country's approach to freedom of expression. While Denmark prides itself on open debate, the governing parties deemed the issue of Palestinian statehood too explosive for classroom discussions. Critics argue that this decision reflects the government's own failures and unwillingness to confront the moral complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The government's actions reveal a preference for protecting sensitivities and maintaining alliances over upholding human rights and international law.</p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team has decided not to call her to the witness stand in her second murder trial, a strategic gamble that could significantly impact the outcome. The prosecution has already played damaging interview clips featuring Read, allowing the jury to hear her version of events, but without her being subject to cross-examination. Legal experts suggest that while Read could perform well on the stand, the defense likely wants to avoid confronting her about inconsistencies in her statements. The absence of Read's testimony may prevent her from clarifying her side of the story, leaving the jury to rely solely on the prosecution's presentation of her words.</p>
