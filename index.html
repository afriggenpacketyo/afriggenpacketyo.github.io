          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani, a state Assembly member, declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum through social media and enthusiasm among younger voters, campaigning on a progressive, economy-focused platform. Cuomo, seeking a political comeback after resigning the governorship, conceded the primary but indicated he might consider an independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 15. Optimism is high for Mamdani's supporters, but the general election remains uncertain with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent. </p>

          <p>Juliana Marins, a 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, was found dead after falling from Mount Rinjani, an active volcano in Indonesia, where she was trapped for almost four days. Marins fell approximately 1,968 feet while summiting the volcano with a guide and five other foreigners. Indonesian authorities used a thermal drone to locate her body beside a crater after intensive searches were complicated by harsh terrain and weather. Her death has been called a tragedy by Brazil's Foreign Ministry, with the country's embassy coordinating with local authorities. The incident has riveted Brazil, with millions following the dramatic search-and-rescue efforts.</p>

He stresses the need for Europe to be more assertive in international affairs, particularly in light of the ongoing challenges with the U.S. The transatlantic alliance is currently trying to reach a compromise before a deadline of July 9, highlighting the urgency of the situation.</p>

The neighbor pleaded guilty to threatening with a blade and will be sentenced in July, but the anti-social behavior continues.

          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine of unpredictability is causing tension at the NATO summit, as European leaders struggle to anticipate his actions and maintain a cohesive defense strategy. Despite efforts to impress Trump with increased defense spending, there is uncertainty about the U.S.'s reliability and commitment to the alliance. The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has further heightened uncertainty, with Trump's actions driven by personal motives and a desire for easy wins rather than strategic calculations. This volatile approach makes it difficult for European democracies to coordinate against external threats, particularly from Russia.</p>

The study suggests that this network could produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems. Researchers emphasize that such a system would need to navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises. Successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after one such clinic went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These online companies act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not directly regulated by the fertility watchdog. Several patients have lost significant amounts of money, with one woman losing nearly Â£15,000, when Apricity Fertility ceased operations. The fertility watchdog is calling for stronger laws to protect patients using these services, as the current law does not reflect the range of fertility treatments being offered today.</p>

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippiâ€™s longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed nearly five decades after kidnapping and killing a bank loan officerâ€™s wife. Jordan, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran with PTSD, was sentenced to death in 1976 for the murder of Edwina Marter during a ransom scheme. His execution follows decades of court proceedings and appeals, with a recent petition for clemency highlighting his war trauma as a potential factor in the crime. The victim's son stated that the execution should have happened a long time ago, reflecting the enduring impact of the crime on the victim's family.</p>

High humidity levels and little nighttime relief are exacerbating the risks, with forecasters predicting record highs in several places. The Mid-Atlantic region is expected to face the most intense conditions, followed by the eastern Ohio Valley, significantly increasing health risks.</p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative agreement on a $321-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12-billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding. It includes cuts to healthcare expansion for undocumented immigrants and reinstates asset limit tests for Medi-Cal enrollees, while preserving cost-of-living adjustments for child-care workers. The agreement also requires legislators to send the governor a version of a proposal to lessen the number of building projects that would require a full environmental review under CEQA.</p>

          <p>According to Reuters, a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment reportedly found that U.S. strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months.

The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the "alleged" assessment was "flat-out wrong", with Trump denying the news on his Truth Social platform, describing CNN as "fake news" and maintaining that Iran's nuclear sites are now "completely destroyed."</p>

These efforts are supported by expanding the range of tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. Despite these moves, the U.S. dollar remains the world's predominant currency, and China's strict capital controls and opaque system pose challenges to large-scale adoption of the yuan.</p>

          <p>Amid increased ICE raids in Los Angeles, a grandmother who lived in the U.S. for 36 years chose to self-deport to Mexico, leaving her family behind. Regina Higuera, fearing the uncertainty of ICE raids, decided to return to her birthplace to maintain control of her life. Her daughter, Julie Ear, noted that her mother had contributed to the economy and paid taxes for years without receiving benefits. Higuera is now reunited with her mother in Mexico, while her children continue to build their lives in the U.S.</p>
