          <p>The temporary tariff truce between the United States and China is set to expire, with no extension yet announced. Tensions are escalating over several issues, including semiconductor export controls, China's purchases of Russian oil, and its dominance in rare-earth metals. While trade data shows a significant decline in shipments between the two nations, experts anticipate a future summit between the leaders, though the relationship is expected to remain unstable. The outcome could involve a new purchase agreement similar to the 2020 Phase One deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beijing's municipal government has unexpectedly relaxed restrictions on property purchases, allowing eligible residents to buy homes outside the city's Fifth Ring Road. This proactive move, which came earlier than anticipated, is seen as an effort to bolster market confidence amid deteriorating sales and home-price data. Analysts believe this signals the central government's willingness to remove buying curbs in non-central urban areas, leading to expectations that major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen may soon follow suit to stimulate their own property markets.

The Israel Defense Forces stated they targeted Sharif, alleging he was involved with a Hamas cell, a claim that came after the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) had expressed grave concern for his safety. According to the CPJ, this incident adds to the more than 180 journalists who have been killed since the conflict began, with the vast majority being Palestinians killed by Israeli forces.</p>

          <p>In an unusual agreement, semiconductor firms Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This deal, reportedly brokered by President Trump, reverses a previous export ban and allows the companies to resume selling certain AI chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the significant Chinese market. The move has drawn criticism from national security experts who worry it could accelerate China's AI capabilities, though the administration claims the approved chips are less advanced.

          <p>Scientists are actively investigating the mystery of how life began on Earth, with two leading hypotheses centered on water-based environments. One theory suggests life originated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, while another points to tide pools as the potential cradle of life. This focus on aquatic origins has spurred scientific interest in exploring so-called "water worlds" elsewhere in our solar system, such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. These explorations seek to determine if similar conditions could have given rise to extraterrestrial life.</p>

Critics argue this spending is unsustainable and relies on tacit political approval, as the government has not enforced laws designed to curb reckless borrowing by clubs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied to the British energy regulator Ofgem for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses in the UK. If approved, this would allow the electric vehicle and energy storage giant to compete with established UK utility firms as early as next year. The move mirrors Tesla's existing electricity service in Texas and comes as the company faces a significant sales slump for its vehicles in key European markets, including the UK and Germany, amid increased competition.

          <p>Following President Trump's social media posts promising a crackdown, federal agents from the FBI and DEA were seen patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. on Sunday. Trump vowed to remove homeless encampments and target criminals, though official data shows a decline in the city's crime rates. The visible federal presence caused confusion among some residents and concern among homeless individuals, who expressed fear of being displaced by the president's new initiative to "beautify" the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, the article explains that newly formed black holes behave differently. During their formation, as they settle into a stable shape, these "baby" black holes emit gravitational waves that can be thought of as a kind of pure, strange music. This phenomenon occurs as the distortion of space-time caused by the black hole's creation quickly stabilizes, squashing any irregularities. Scientists are developing ways to detect and experience these "good vibrations" from the cosmos.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a national childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three to address its low birth rate. Analysts suggest the scheme's impact will be most significant in less affluent regions where the handout represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the subsidy amounts to over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai, potentially boosting consumption and birth rates more effectively in rural areas.
