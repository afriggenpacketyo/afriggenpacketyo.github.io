          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down a law that prevented men from taking their wives' surnames, ruling it constituted gender-based discrimination. The case was brought by two couples who argued the law was archaic, patriarchal, and violated the equality rights established in the post-apartheid constitution. Following the ruling, which was seen as a significant victory for gender equality, Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The government did not oppose the couples' application in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the journal Nature has linked over 200 severe global heat waves to the greenhouse gas pollution from major fossil fuel and cement companies. Researchers found that the emissions from these entities, known as carbon majors, made these extreme weather events substantially more likely and intense. Some of the deadliest heat waves, including the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome, were found to be virtually impossible without this specific climate pollution. This research adds to a growing body of evidence that could become significant in litigation against corporations for climate-change related damages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are raising concerns that a significant rise in fall-related deaths among seniors over the past three decades may be linked to the increased use of certain prescription drugs. A category of medications known as fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs), which includes opioids, benzodiazepines, and some antidepressants, can cause drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired balance. While lifestyle changes cannot fully account for the spike in fatalities, medical professionals suggest that the soaring use of these drugs is a major contributing factor. Physicians advise patients to discuss the risks and benefits of these medications with their primary care provider.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency is backing a major infrastructure project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam, a key hub in the Yangtze Economic Belt. The initiative involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance the Gezhouba dam's capacity. With an estimated investment of 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), the project is described as the largest on the Yangtze River since the original dam's construction. This move is part of a broader push for strategic investment to drive economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson, the British Ambassador to the United States, after newly released documents revealed a closer relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than previously known. The decision was prompted by emails showing Mandelson referring to Epstein as his "best pal" and suggesting Epstein's first conviction was wrongful. The British Foreign Office stated this new information showed the relationship was "materially different" from what was understood at the time of his appointment. The dismissal came just a day after the Prime Minister had publicly expressed confidence in the ambassador.</p>

          <p>In Kenya, serodiscordant couples, where one partner is HIV-positive and the other is not, are facing increased anxiety due to recent U.S. foreign aid cuts. These couples rely on preventative measures like antiretroviral drugs, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and condoms to manage the virus and prevent transmission. However, the reduction in funding has led to shortages of these crucial supplies, with clinics rationing medications and condom dispensers often empty. This disruption jeopardizes the health and safety of these families, who have successfully used modern medicine to live together and have HIV-negative children.</p>

He argued that Germany can no longer afford an isolationist attitude and must take a more active role on the international stage to protect its own interests.

          <p>California legislative leaders have reached an eleventh-hour agreement on a comprehensive package of climate and energy bills ahead of the session's end. The deal includes extending the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, creating a pathway for a regional electricity market with other Western states, and a controversial measure to streamline new oil well approvals in Kern County. While supporters say the package will lower electricity bills and improve grid reliability, some environmental groups criticize it for not going far enough and for making concessions to the oil industry. Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he will sign the legislation.</p>

          <p>Food critic Bill Addison reviews 88 Club, the new Beverly Hills restaurant from "Top Chef" winner Mei Lin, finding moments of brilliance alongside dishes that feel underdeveloped. The prawn toasts are highlighted as a standout creation, demonstrating Lin's talent for reconfiguring classic Chinese American snacks with precision and flair. However, the review notes that much of the broader menu, which explores regional Chinese cuisines, lacks the same strong, singular vision. While some dishes like the black bean clams are persuasive, others come off as beautifully plated but ultimately impassive, needing a stronger perspective to justify their fine-dining price point.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration, while campaigning on ending "forever wars," has initiated two new unwinnable conflicts at home: a military-style war on drugs and a symbolic war on crime in U.S. cities. The author criticizes the deployment of significant military assets to the Caribbean for drug interdiction and the use of the National Guard in cities like Los Angeles and Washington as costly distractions. These actions are seen as degrading military readiness at a time when the U.S. should be focusing on the strategic threat posed by China, the nation's only true competitor.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that with the federal government fully controlled by Republicans, the Democratic Party should be willing to force a government shutdown to negotiate for its priorities. As the Sept. 30 funding deadline approaches, the author contends that simply allowing the government to continue operating under President Trump's direction is a disservice to their constituents. Instead of repeating their past acquiescence, Democrats should use their leverage in the Senate to demand concessions, such as restoring healthcare funding and extending tax credits. A temporary shutdown, while painful, is presented as a necessary tool to fight for their platform.</p>

He was one of 252 Venezuelans removed from the U.S. by the Trump administration, which accused them of being gang members despite many having no criminal record. While detained, he became a symbol for a movement demanding their release, and he alleges he was beaten and sexually assaulted by guards. A U.S. appeals court has since ruled the administration acted unlawfully, and officials have stated they would facilitate the return of the Venezuelans to continue their asylum cases.</p>

This natural life-cycle stage for female octopuses involves laying eggs and caring for them until they hatch, during which she will neglect her own needs and eventually die. Because Ghost did not have a mate, her eggs are unfertilized, but her maternal behavior remains the same, a situation that also occurs in the wild. The aquarium announced she will be moved behind the scenes to live out her final days caring for her eggs.</p>

The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, aims to remove the fear of academic probation or expulsion, which can deter students from seeking immediate medical help. Advocates argue this protection is crucial amid the ongoing opioid crisis, ensuring that students prioritize saving a life over concerns about disciplinary action.

The current moment is marked by a growing belief that violence is a viable solution when the political system is perceived as broken. This trend raises urgent questions about how leaders will respond and whether the cycle of violence and retaliation can be broken.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have now been able to observationally verify a key theory about black holes proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. Hawking's area theorem states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. By analyzing the gravitational waves from a black hole merger detected earlier this year, researchers confirmed that the surface area of the new, combined black hole was greater than the sum of the two original black holes. This achievement, made possible by significant upgrades to gravitational wave detectors, provides powerful evidence for one of Hawking's foundational ideas.</p>
