        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is under pressure as its efforts to reduce National Health Service waiting lists show minimal progress. An analysis by BBC Verify reveals that over a third of hospital trusts are further from the 18-week waiting time target than they were when the improvement plan was announced. While the Health Secretary expresses confidence in meeting future goals, citing a drop in the total waiting list, patient groups and doctors warn that the slow pace leaves many individuals waiting in constant pain. The article highlights the personal toll on patients, like a 73-year-old man who has forgotten what it feels like to not be in pain.</p>

          <p>In a complex legal case, the Trump administration has indicated it may attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a country other than his native El Salvador if he is released from jail. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error," despite a court order barring it due to fears of gang persecution. After being returned to the U.S., he was jailed on separate smuggling charges in Tennessee. His lawyers are now fighting to protect him from another deportation and secure his return to his family in Maryland, highlighting a prolonged and difficult legal struggle.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for the ultra-rare and life-threatening condition, Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS). The genetic disorder, which severely weakens the immune system, claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives. Her family played a crucial role in the research that identified the faulty gene just 12 years ago, leading to this breakthrough treatment. The drug, taken as a daily tablet, works by allowing the immune system to function normally, giving the young woman hope for a long and healthy life.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a blunt critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. In a speech, she argued that the party must refocus on fundamental economic issues affecting the middle class, which she called the nation's greatest security threat. Slotkin urged Democrats to prioritize creating better jobs, affordable education, and more housing to address the struggles of ordinary Americans. She characterized the party's central conflict as one between those who see a second Trump term as an existential threat and those who view it as merely survivable.</p>

          <p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) is launching a comprehensive audit of its government contracting officers following the discovery of a massive, long-term bribery scheme at USAID. SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler stated the USAID fraud, which involved an official receiving over $1 million in bribes for contracts, reflects systemic oversight failures. The audit will examine all grant-awarding authority exercised under the agency's business development program since 2010. This action aims to crack down on potential abuses and restore integrity to the federal contracting process, ensuring it is based on merit rather than personal gain.</p>

Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage the financial effects of these trade policies throughout the year. The company's recent earnings report exceeded estimates, with shares rising over 5% as consumers continue to prioritize flavor and home cooking despite economic pressures.</p>

The sneaker giant also faces a new challenge from tariffs, which it estimates will add approximately $1 billion in incremental costs in the coming fiscal year. Despite the steep profit decline, the company's revenue and earnings beat Wall Street estimates, and executives confirmed that this quarter represents the low point of the financial impact.

The celestial body, dubbed TWA 7b, is thought to have a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young, nearby star. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which suppresses the star's bright glare to reveal fainter nearby objects. While there is a small possibility the object could be a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet, marking a significant achievement for the telescope.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has officially announced his campaign for a third term, positioning himself as a leader who solves problems for working families. In his announcement, he touted his administration's record, including seven consecutive balanced budgets, nine state credit upgrades, and the passage of legislation to raise the minimum wage and ban assault weapons. Pritzker also drew a sharp contrast with the Trump administration, stating that government should be a force for good, not a "weapon of revenge." His announcement has fueled speculation about a potential presidential run in 2028, though he declined to comment on future plans.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a passenger train and a vehicle in Gary, Indiana, resulted in the deaths of five people from the same family. According to officials, the vehicle drove around the activated crossing gates and into the path of an eastbound South Shore Line train. All five occupants of the vehicleâ€”three men and two women, all in their early twentiesâ€”were ejected and pronounced dead at the scene. The 32 passengers and four crew members aboard the train were unharmed. Officials emphasized the extreme danger of ignoring railroad crossing signals, stressing that it is not worth the risk.</p>

Furthermore, growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts later this year has buoyed investor confidence, pushing major indices toward their previous peaks despite ongoing geopolitical and economic risks.

          <p>Recent American and Israeli military strikes have dealt a significant blow to Iran's nuclear program, but the full extent of the damage remains uncertain. While President Trump claims the program was "obliterated," military assessments are more cautious. Key sites like the fortified Fordo facility and the Natanz enrichment plant were heavily targeted, with bunker-busting bombs destroying surface structures and damaging underground halls. However, experts warn that Iran may still possess a significant capability, as its stockpile of highly enriched uranium could have been moved to undisclosed, protected locations before the attacks, posing an ongoing proliferation risk.</p>

These grants were intended to fund local projects addressing pollution and climate resilience in vulnerable communities.

          <h2>Californians Face Higher Costs for Fourth of July Barbecues Compared to National Average</h2>

          <p>Californians planning a Fourth of July cookout will be paying significantly more for groceries than the rest of the country, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. A barbecue for ten guests in California is estimated to cost $90.06, compared to the national average of $70.92. Staples like ground beef, chicken breasts, and pork chops all carry steep premiums in the state. The higher prices are attributed to a combination of factors, including inflation, reduced availability of some food items, and the economic impacts of recent tariffs, which increase costs that are often passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco was found guilty of sexual abuse in the Dominican Republic but will not serve prison time, instead receiving a two-year suspended sentence. Franco was accused of having a relationship with a 14-year-old girl, but he was acquitted of more serious charges, including commercial exploitation and human trafficking. The girl's mother, however, was found guilty of consenting to the illegal relationship in exchange for money and was sentenced to a five-year prison term. Franco's attorney plans to appeal the ruling, while his future in Major League Baseball remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>California Appeals Court Dismisses Criminal Case Against Top GascÃ³n Advisor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 17:22:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A California appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a top advisor to former Los Angeles County District Attorney George GascÃ³n. Teran was charged with improperly downloading confidential police records while at the Sheriff's Department and using them at the D.A.'s office. The court ruled unanimously that her actions were not criminal, as the documents she accessed were public court records that any member of the public could have reviewed. The decision is a significant rebuke of the prosecution brought by the state Attorney General's office, which critics had long argued was politically motivated.</p>
