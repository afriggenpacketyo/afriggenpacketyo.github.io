          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the newly elected leader of Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party. In his message, Xi emphasized the "common political foundation" shared by the Communist Party and the KMT, based on the "1992 consensus" and opposition to Taiwan's independence. He called for joint efforts to advance the peaceful "reunification" of China, amidst rising cross-strait tensions since the Democratic Progressive Party took power in Taipei in 2016. The new KMT leader responded by expressing a commitment to strengthening communication and promoting peace in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati confirmed that a robbery had taken place at the museum's opening that morning, prompting an immediate police investigation. While details about what, if anything, was stolen were not immediately available, the minister reported that no one was injured during the incident. The museum posted a notice on its website about the closure, thanking visitors for their understanding as authorities continue their investigation.</p>

          <p>Solar power technology is being integrated into numerous surprising locations beyond traditional rooftop panels, according to a recent report. Innovations include generating electricity from solar canopies over roads and parking lots, installing modules on railway tracks, and embedding invisible solar cells into building facades. The article also highlights the growth of agrivoltaics, where solar panels are placed above crops, and the development of large-scale floating solar parks on lakes and seas. While still in its early stages, research into beaming solar energy from space is also being explored as a future possibility.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 06:00:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has decreased to 6.18%, its lowest level since October of the previous year. This downward trend is partly attributed to the ongoing government shutdown, which has also led to longer processing times for FHA and VA loans. The article provides a detailed breakdown of current rates for various mortgage and refinance products, including 15-year fixed loans and adjustable-rate mortgages. It advises potential borrowers to focus on improving personal financial metrics like credit scores and debt-to-income ratios to secure the most favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labor unions in the United States have become a primary force of opposition against the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce and curtail workers' rights. By filing dozens of lawsuits, unions are challenging executive orders aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights and facilitating mass layoffs of government employees. Legal experts note that these court battles are not only defending federal workers but also upholding the principle of a nonpartisan civil service. A recent victory includes a temporary restraining order blocking layoffs related to the government shutdown, showcasing the unions' significant role in this ongoing struggle.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a new strategy to bolster the UK's clean energy sector, promising the creation of 400,000 additional jobs by the end of the decade. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers and electricians, to support the expansion of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and nuclear. To facilitate this transition, the initiative includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges" and launching programs to retrain veterans and oil and gas workers for green energy roles. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the goal is to lower energy bills and provide well-paid, secure jobs in industrial communities.</p>

The fraudsters used high-pressure sales tactics to sell them useless "credits" instead, funding a lavish lifestyle with the proceeds.

          <p>A Greater Manchester Police sergeant has received the King's Commendation for Bravery for his actions during a knife ambush in July 2023. Sgt. Tim Ansell was stabbed in the neck and body while intervening to help his colleague, Sgt. Marc Foster, who was being attacked by a 27-year-old man with a knife. Bodycam footage shows the assailant running up from behind before a third officer, PC Marcus Wolstencroft, subdued him with a Taser. Both injured sergeants survived the attack, and their assailant was later sentenced to an indefinite hospital order.</p>

          <p>Massive crowds gathered in cities across the U.S. for "No Kings" protests, demonstrating against the policies and perceived overreach of President Donald Trump's administration. Organizers estimated that nearly seven million people participated in peaceful events held in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, and other major centers. Protesters voiced concerns over the expansion of presidential power, the use of executive orders, and actions they view as unconstitutional and a threat to democracy. Despite some states mobilizing the National Guard, the nationwide demonstrations were reported to be largely peaceful.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of carrying out long-term and highly covert cyberattacks against its National Time Service Center. This critical facility, based in Xian, is responsible for maintaining and distributing China's official standard time, which is essential for the country's defense, finance, and communication sectors. The ministry's statement claimed that the attacks utilized "state-level cyberespionage tools," marking another point of contention in the escalating technological and security rivalry between the two nations. The U.S. embassy has not yet responded to the allegations.</p>

          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool is experiencing a period of poor form, with some analysis pointing to the tactical impact of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid. The article suggests his absence is felt beyond his direct goal contributions, particularly in the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Alexander-Arnold's unique passing range and ability to use his weaker foot provided tactical flexibility that the team now lacks. As a result, other players are being used in deeper roles, which may not maximize their attacking potential.</p>

          <h2>Psychologists Explain Why Sexual Desire Often Wanes in Long-Term Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 00:56:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual frequency and desire to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon driven by both psychological and hormonal changes. According to psychologists, the initial passion is fueled by a cocktail of hormones that diminishes over time, while bonding hormones like oxytocin become more prominent, dampening sex drive. The article emphasizes that open communication about needs and desires is crucial for maintaining intimacy. Additionally, factors like a lack of non-sexual physical affection and failing to prioritize female pleasure can contribute to a decline in sexual activity for many couples.</p>
