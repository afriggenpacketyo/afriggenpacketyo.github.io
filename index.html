          <h2>Republicans Express Regret After House Passage of Policy Bill</h2>

          <p>Following the passage of a sprawling policy bill through the House by a narrow margin, some Republicans are expressing regret, claiming they did not fully understand the implications of their vote. The legislation, central to President Trump's domestic agenda, passed with only one vote to spare. This situation highlights potential issues with the legislative process and the understanding of bills by lawmakers before voting. The bill's complexity and potential consequences may not have been fully grasped by all members before its passage, leading to current reservations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are predicting a surge in electricity prices in the United States due to the Republican megabill's provisions. The combination of increased data center development, rising gas exports, and cuts to clean energy tax incentives is expected to drive up American energy bills. This could have significant implications for consumers and businesses, increasing the cost of living and potentially impacting economic growth. The analysts suggest a reevaluation of the bill's energy-related provisions to mitigate the anticipated price hikes.</p>

          <p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official resigned from her role overseeing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered an update to the agency's guidance. Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos cited her inability to continue helping the most vulnerable populations under the imposed changes. Kennedy's directive included excluding pregnant women from COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, a decision that broke with the committee's advice and expert concerns about higher risks for pregnant women. This resignation highlights concerns about political interference in public health decisions and the potential impact on vaccine policies.</p>

This comes after a meeting between Trump and Powell at the White House where Trump reportedly stated that Powell was making a mistake by not lowering interest rates.

          <p>The collapse of the Dutch government, triggered by right-wing leader Geert Wilders' withdrawal from the coalition, has created political turmoil ahead of the NATO summit. Wilders' exit was prompted by disagreements over stricter immigration policies and, more significantly, the Netherlands' commitment to increase defense spending to meet NATO targets. The upcoming NATO summit and expectations for the Dutch government to boost defense spending played a larger role in prompting Wilders' exit. Prime Minister Dick Schoof has resigned, setting the stage for snap elections, while the country grapples with political instability and the need to address rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

Sweden will pay 8,500 euros per inmate per month, which is less than the average cost of 11,500 euros per month in Sweden.
