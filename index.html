          <p>A survey by Shibuya Ward and the nonprofit Nijiiro Diversity reveals that a same-sex partnership system, first introduced in 2015, is now available to 92.5% of Japan's population. As of May 2025, 530 local governments have adopted the system, with 9,836 couples registered. However, Japan remains the only G7 nation without legalized same-sex marriage, and these partnership certificates are not legally binding, denying couples rights like medical decision-making and tax benefits. Activists continue to advocate for full marriage equality, highlighting the gap between widespread local acceptance and national law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has come into force, reducing tariffs on key exports. The deal allows British car manufacturers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles annually to the US at a 10% tariff, and eliminates tariffs on UK aerospace exports. In exchange, the UK scraps tariffs on US beef and ethanol, a move criticized by the domestic bioethanol industry. However, a significant point of contention remains, as UK steel and aluminum are still subject to a 25% tariff, which could double if a separate deal is not reached by the July 9 deadline.

Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association for the first quarter of 2025 shows decreased murder rates in cities like Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and New York City, all of which boosted police funding in 2024. A spokesperson for the National Police Association suggests this indicates a public rejection of the "defund the police" movement.

The content ranges from manipulative dating advice to outright hatred, often packaged in professionally produced videos and podcasts that hook young, unsuspecting users.

          <p>Paul Ince, the former captain of the England national football team, has been charged with drink-driving. The 57-year-old was arrested after a Range Rover crashed into a central reservation barrier on the Wirral. Ince, who won 53 caps for England and played for clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool, became the first Black footballer to captain the national team in 1993. After retiring as a player, he moved into management and has been bailed to appear in court in July.</p>

          <p>Several high-profile golfers, including Ryder Cup legends Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, and Graeme McDowell, are competing in final qualifying for a chance to play at The 153rd Open at Royal Portrush.

The competition features intriguing storylines, such as Ian Poulter competing against his own son, Luke, for one of the limited spots. A total of 288 players will compete for just 20 places in golf's oldest major championship.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has been met with a significant wave of racist and Islamophobic attacks from political figures and commentators. The article argues that this reaction is not just about his Muslim faith but also his progressive politics, which challenge mainstream orthodoxies on capitalism and Israel. Despite his clear condemnations of antisemitism and hate crimes, he has been smeared as a terrorist sympathizer. The author suggests this backlash reveals the weakness and prejudice of the political establishment, which uses his identity to discredit his popular economic and political beliefs.</p>

          <p>Ghana is confronting a growing problem of illegal gold mining, with increasing blame directed at Chinese nationals involved in the operations. This has led to a diplomatic pushback from China's ambassador to Ghana, Tong Defa, who argued the perception is unfair. The ambassador stated that Chinese nationals cannot obtain local mining licenses and are often brought in by Ghanaian facilitators. The issue highlights a point of friction in the relationship between the two countries, centered on environmental damage and resource exploitation.</p>

          <p>Recent market speculation has positioned British oil giant BP as an acquisition target for rivals like Shell, though Shell has denied any talks. BP's vulnerability stems from a combination of factors, including the abrupt 2023 departure of CEO Bernard Looney, who had initiated a major strategic shift towards renewable energy. The company's share price has underperformed compared to its peers, and declining profits have raised questions about its strategy. While new CEO Murray Auchincloss insists BP is a strong independent company, its situation reflects the pressures facing major energy firms. (not investment advice)</p>
