          <h2>Global Military Spending Reaches Record High Amidst Rising Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global military expenditure surged to a record $2.72 trillion in 2024, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year and the steepest rise since 1988, according to an international security think tank. This surge is attributed to Russia's war in Ukraine and heightened tensions in the Middle East. Over 100 countries increased their military spending, with the United States and China accounting for nearly half of the global total, raising concerns about economic and social trade-offs as governments prioritize military security over other budget areas. The rising investment into advanced military capabilities, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, could lead to a dangerous arms-race spiral.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs, intended to protect the U.S. auto industry, may inadvertently harm it by isolating it from global innovation. While China has made significant strides in producing next-generation vehicles with state subsidies, U.S. automakers risk falling behind in electrification, digitization, and automation. The author contends that losing the auto industry could also jeopardize America's capacity to manufacture vital technologies and military equipment, drawing parallels to the challenges faced in the 1980s when Japanese imports overwhelmed U.S. manufacturers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines is causing carriers to reroute flights between India and destinations in Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East, leading to longer and more expensive journeys. Some flights may require refueling stops or face cancellations, potentially affecting competition with airlines that can still overfly Pakistan. While a similar airspace closure in 2019 cost Indian airlines significantly, analysts believe the impact on airfares may be limited, though some routes have already seen price drops. The closure follows heightened tensions between the two countries after the killing of 26 tourists in Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Populist politics, often promising a simpler life, tend to produce more hassle and chaos when applied to real-world problems, as seen with Brexit and immigration policies. While populist movements initially offer a sense of liberation and challenge conventional politics, their attempts to control complex issues often result in increased bureaucracy and intervention. The Trump administration's efforts to micromanage institutions and Reform UK's strict policies exemplify how the politics of simplicity can lead to impractical and overambitious governance, potentially disillusioning voters who sought less government intervention.</p>

          <p>North Korea has confirmed for the first time that it sent troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine, stating that the deployment was intended to help Russia regain control of the Kursk region. Leader Kim Jong Un authorized the troop deployment under a mutual defense treaty signed with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024, citing a mission to "annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers." The statement did not disclose the number of troops sent or casualties, but South Korean sources estimate thousands of North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded.</p>
