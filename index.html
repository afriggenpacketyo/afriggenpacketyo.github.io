        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the US imposing a port fee targeting ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. MSC's senior vice-president, Marie-Caroline Laurent, stated that the port fee would not deter them due to China's unmatched competitiveness in shipbuilding. The International Maritime Organisation's push for net-zero emissions in the shipping industry is driving investments in decarbonisation technologies and new ship orders. Laurent noted that reviving America's shipbuilding sector would require state subsidies and strategic asset retention, but this wouldn't immediately alter MSC's shipbuilding strategy. China's competence and capabilities in building these vessels for the energy transition remain unparalleled, making it the preferred choice for now.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the conflict between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk over the 'Big, Beautiful Bill,' with Musk calling it a 'disgusting abomination'. House Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to contact Musk to address the situation, but Musk instead posted a 'KILL the Bill' meme on X, alarming Congressional Republicans. Despite Musk's influence, Republicans are standing firm, asserting they lack time for a new bill. Democrats, however, see Musk's opposition as an opportunity to derail the legislation, highlighting the political complexities and divisions surrounding the bill. The disagreement arises from concerns about the bill's impact on the deficit, as analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murdering three people and attempting to kill another with a mushroom lunch, testified that she wanted the meal to be 'special' for her relatives. Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, died after the lunch, while Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, survived. Patterson claims the inclusion of poisonous mushrooms was accidental, stemming from foraged mushrooms mixed with store-bought ones. The prosecutor, Nanette Rogers, alleges Patterson intentionally poisoned her guests, a claim Patterson vehemently denies, often becoming emotional. The trial is expected to continue for at least another two weeks as Patterson faces cross-examination.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's central bank has exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it down to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which saw the economy expand by 7.4% year-on-year. Despite this positive growth, the central bank has maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, indicating a slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The decision also comes amid a downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent headline inflation reading for April at 3.16%, its lowest level since July 2019. The RBI had previously expressed concerns about growth amid potential tariff threats from the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his role in the party's rise since the general election. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, donated Â£200,000 to Reform UK and later became its chairman, contributing to the party's organizational structure. His heritage and ethnicity also helped broaden the party's appeal, countering criticisms of racism. However, Yusuf's management style reportedly caused friction within the party, highlighting the challenge of scaling up Reform UK with stable staffing. The departure underscores the need for Reform UK to hire and retain experienced staff to transform the party into an election-winning machine.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision. Presiding Judge Toshikazu Kino stated that the government's earthquake assessment did not provide a sufficient basis for the utility to swiftly implement tsunami countermeasures. The lawyer for the shareholders seeking damages criticized the ruling as fundamentally flawed and expressed intentions to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Opposition is growing among UK MPs to the Assisted Dying Bill, which would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live. Several MPs who previously supported or abstained are now likely to vote against the bill, citing concerns about protecting vulnerable individuals. These MPs are worried that the bill lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent coercion and ensure that assisted dying is not overextended.

          <p>A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a ban on Harvard University accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the university would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to take effect. The order follows a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Donald Trump of a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary for national security reasons, accusing Harvard of insufficient action against antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, accused of murdering his three daughters, struggled with mental health issues and PTSD, according to his ex-wife's attorney. The attorney emphasized that the 'system failed' Decker, who was a former member of the military, by not providing adequate mental health resources. Despite previous restrictions on his parenting due to mental health concerns, there were no recent 'red flags' before the tragic event. The ex-wife maintains that Decker was a loving and active father, and she expresses empathy for him despite the horrific circumstances.</p>

          <p>North Korea successfully launched a warship, weeks after an earlier attempt resulted in damage and criticism from leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer was restored and launched, now moored at a pier, with Kim previously condemning the initial incident as a 'criminal act'. The ship is expected to be fully operational before a ruling party meeting this month, signaling Pyongyang's continued focus on military advancement. Kim's severe response to the failed launch underscores the regime's commitment to projecting an image of a rising military power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is doubling down on accusations, without evidence, that Joe Biden's aides illegally used an autopen to enact policies during his presidency. Trump claimed that Biden was not really running the country and that his aides used the autopen to carry out 'radical' policies. Biden has denied these allegations, calling the probe a mere distraction, and the Justice Department's legal counsel have endorsed autopens as lawful. Trump claimed he could identify which executive orders were signed with the autopen and that 'radical left lunatics' were using it without Biden's consent.</p>

In many states, time spent in detention awaiting trial or placement in a rehabilitative program doesn't count toward their eventual sentence. This adds months to their confinement, impacting their development and straining resources. The juvenile justice system, intended to be rehabilitative, often fails to provide services during detention, rendering the time 'worthless' and potentially harmful.</p>
