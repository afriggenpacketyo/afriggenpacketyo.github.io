        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first policy meeting, newly-confirmed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran was the sole dissenter, advocating for a half-point interest rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the committee. Appointed by President Trump, Miran's dissent highlights the ongoing political pressure on the central bank's independence and decision-making process. His move is seen by some critics as aligning with the administration's repeated calls for more aggressive monetary easing to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve implemented a quarter-point interest rate cut, the first of the year, in an effort to support a slowing labor market. The decision aligns with long-standing demands from President Trump for lower rates, though he has publicly called for more substantial cuts. This move occurs amid a complex economic environment with concerns of stagflation and a contentious political backdrop involving Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed's board of governors.

While the administration states this ensures new citizens are assimilated, immigrant advocates argue it creates unnecessary barriers for legal immigrants seeking to naturalize.</p>

          <h2>Report Reveals Treasury Secretary Bessent Made Mortgage Claims Similar to Those Used Against Fed's Cook</h2>

          <p>A new report indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once designated two separate properties as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007. This situation is similar to the mortgage claims that President Trump cited in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Bessent had previously stated that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, it should be examined, creating a politically charged context for the new revelations about his own past real estate dealings.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut is set to have a mixed but tangible impact on household finances. Consumers with variable-rate debt, such as credit cards, will likely see their interest costs decrease almost immediately. Conversely, savers may experience lower returns on high-yield savings accounts and CDs. The effect on longer-term fixed rates, like mortgages, is expected to be more gradual and has largely been priced into current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has unveiled a new strategic agenda designed to significantly enhance its partnership with India, aiming to draw the country away from Russia's orbit. This diplomatic approach of engagement through trade and defense cooperation contrasts with recent US calls to penalize India with high tariffs for purchasing Russian oil. EU officials view India as a vital counterweight to China and a key partner in diversifying global supply chains, despite acknowledging existing disagreements over foreign policy.</p>

The author argues that the government has been slow to adopt modern, real-time data from private sources, which could offer a more accurate and dynamic view of the economy.
