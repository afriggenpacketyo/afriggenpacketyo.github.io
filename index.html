          <p>President Trump asserted that the current economic downturn is attributable to Biden's policies, despite concerns that Trump's tariffs are impacting the market.

          <p>This article presents a collection of powerful images from the final days of the Vietnam War, marking the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon. The photos capture the desperation of South Vietnamese civilians attempting to flee the city, as well as the evacuation of American personnel. The fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, marked the end of the South Vietnamese government and decades of conflict. It also shows South Vietnamese soldiers stripping off their uniforms to blend in with civilians.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams has described a BBC TV program on the murder of an informer as an "attempted hatchet job" on him during his libel case against the BBC at the High Court in Dublin. Adams claims the program defamed him by alleging he sanctioned the killing of former Sinn Féin official Denis Donaldson, who was shot dead in Donegal in 2006 after admitting to being a police and MI5 agent. Adams denies any involvement, and the Real IRA admitted to the killing in 2009. Adams also spoke about the development of the peace process.</p>

          <p>Former US ambassadors to countries that experienced autocratic takeovers have warned that the US is treading a similar path, citing a "climate of fear" and attempts to intimidate the media.

The ambassadors urged Democrats to actively challenge these trends and protect democratic institutions. The former ambassadors signed an open letter calling for urgent action to challenge what they called Trump’s “assault on democracy”.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a dispute over Oklahoma's efforts to create an online Catholic charter school, a decision that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. A ruling in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School could upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia, requiring charter schools to be nonsectarian. The case centers on whether charter schools are public schools and whether the Establishment Clause allows direct aid for religious instruction in public schools.</p>

          <p>The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal income tax credit available to employers who hire candidates from certain target groups who have consistently faced significant barriers to employment. The credit, which directly reduces an employer's tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, making it more valuable than a tax deduction, is authorized under the Internal Revenue Code and administered jointly by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The amount of the credit varies based on the number of hours worked and the employee's wages during their first year of employment. </p>

          <p>The US economy contracted in the first quarter of Trump's second term, with GDP falling by 0.3%. President Trump attributed the decline to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while economists pointed to a surge in imports ahead of Trump's tariffs as a major factor. The contraction comes amid a drop in consumer sentiment and concerns about the impact of tariffs on trade and the global economy. The research firm Capital Economics noted that the last three months saw a 41% boost in imports as companies wanted to prepare for incoming tariffs.</p>
