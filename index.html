          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm, bringing its powerful impact to the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda, though no immediate watches or warnings were issued. Forecasters predict it will maintain major hurricane status for several days, with generated swells likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast starting Monday. This significant storm is the eighth named system of the 2025 Atlantic season, following Hurricane Gabrielle. Additionally, a second storm system, Tropical Depression Nine, is brewing over the northeast Caribbean, expected to bring significant rainfall and potential flooding to Cuba and the Bahamas early next week.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Elliott, then 17, is accused of fatally stabbing his twin sister Meghan in her sleep, a crime he claims occurred while sleepwalking. His defense attorneys, supported by a sleep disorder expert who conducted studies, argue that Benjamin, who has a family history of sleepwalking, acted involuntarily during a brief period of deep sleep. Despite Benjamin's loving relationship with Meghan and prosecutors finding no motive, they question his account and the medical examiner's findings of two neck wounds, leading to a murder trial for the teen. The case highlights the rare and complex defense of sleepwalking in criminal proceedings.</p>

Dane, 52, revealed his battle with the neurodegenerative disease in April, describing the progressive loss of limb function, including the impending loss of his left hand. Gayheart, who dismissed her divorce petition after his diagnosis, expressed heartbreak but noted their family has grown closer despite the devastating circumstances. The article highlights their reliance on therapists and the hope they find in his medical care, even as they confront the severe physical challenges of ALS and the search for a cure.</p>

Two pro-Russia parties, Greater Moldova and Heart of Moldova, were disqualified due to illegal financing, intensifying the political tension ahead of the vote. Polls suggest Sandu's pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity may lose its majority, while pro-Russian factions are expected to perform well. The article underscores the country's deep political division between Brussels and Moscow, with disinformation and propaganda campaigns surging online, threatening Moldova's democratic future and its promising path towards EU integration by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran through a "snapback" mechanism, targeting frozen assets abroad, arms deals, and ballistic missile development. This action, triggered by France, Germany, and the UK due to Iran's non-compliance with nuclear monitoring, comes as Iran's economy faces record-low currency values and soaring food prices, exacerbating public hardship. The article notes growing fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the U.S., alongside a reported surge in executions within the Islamic Republic. Iran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful despite a stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium, condemned the sanctions as "unfair, unjust, and illegal."</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the Trump era could mark a "reverse convergence" in US-China relations, moving away from traditional ideological frameworks. The author argues that instead of the West imposing liberal democratic values, the US under Trump appears to be adopting approaches similar to China regarding political legitimacy and matters of war and peace. This shift is not seen as the US losing soft power but rather a convergence in practical governance, challenging long-held Western convergence theories.

          <p>Venezuela is escalating its defense posture by training civilian militias, following deadly U.S. navy strikes in the South Caribbean that targeted alleged drug boats and killed 17 people. President Nicolás Maduro has labeled the U.S. actions an "undeclared war," deploying naval forces for counter-narcotics operations. The article highlights the deteriorating U.S.-Venezuela relationship, with the U.S. not recognizing Maduro's re-election and accusing him of drug cartel ties. While experts doubt a full invasion, the mobilization of primarily older volunteers, trained in handling weapons, is seen as a strategy to increase the human cost of any potential U.S. military action.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the scientific efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, exploring oral, topical, and injectable methods. While some users report positive results, dermatologists express skepticism about oral supplements reaching the skin effectively, as collagen is a large molecule. Industry-funded studies suggest benefits, but independent research often finds no significant effect. The article advises that marine collagen is generally preferred over bovine or vegan options for oral intake. Experts ultimately recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as far more impactful strategies for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

The piece coincides with the 50th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, and the 25th anniversary of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. It explores how China, following its reform and opening-up policy, has rapidly closed the gap and potentially surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future.
