          <h2>CEOs Predict 'Trump Recession' Amid Tariff Concerns and Potential Job Losses</h2>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concerns about President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with a majority (69%) anticipating a recession, potentially hitting this year. CEOs expressed anxieties ranging from sector-specific cost increases to broader economic consequences such as reduced consumer spending and the potential for boycotts of American brands. Many are preparing for price hikes and anticipate resurgent inflation, while some are already considering job cuts. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the tariffs' larger-than-expected impact, projecting higher inflation and slower growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cox Automotive predicts notable increases in new and used vehicle prices due to President Trump's 25% auto tariffs, potentially adding thousands of dollars to costs. Automakers are responding in various ways, including temporary deals and ceasing U.S. shipments, but the levies are expected to impact consumer purchases and overall sales. Cox estimates a $6,000 increase for imported vehicles and a $3,600 increase for U.S.-assembled vehicles due to tariffs on parts. The used car market is also expected to see price increases, albeit less dramatic than during the pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 4% despite fears of an economic slowdown triggered by President Trump's tariffs. Investors are adjusting their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, with increased anticipation of multiple cuts this year. Concerns are rising that international investors may no longer view the U.S. as a safe haven, contributing to falling Treasury prices and rising yields. The tariffs, imposing a baseline of 10% across the board and higher rates for major trading partners, have stoked fears of a global trade war and retaliatory measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, arguing that a federal court cannot order the president to engage in foreign diplomacy. The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was sent to El Salvador despite having protected legal status, which the government has attributed to an "administrative error." Lower courts have ordered his return, citing a lack of due process and criticizing the government's handling of the situation.

          <p>Amid massive layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), top officials have been offered reassignments to positions within the Indian Health Service (IHS), a move described as an "insult" and a way to force talented scientists and health experts to leave government. The reassignment offers, which include locations in Alaska, Montana, and New Mexico, have raised concerns about undermining leadership in federal health agencies. Some suspect the targets were picked as retribution dating back to the pandemic, with connections to former NIH director Dr. Anthony Fauci. The IHS is seen as being used as a pawn in this process, despite its crucial service to underserved communities.</p>

          <p>Following the election of Mark Carney as the new prime minister of Canada, a snap election has been called amidst escalating trade tensions with the US. This comes after President Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war. The election, scheduled for April 28, will pit Carney against Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh. Recent polls suggest a tightening race, with the Liberals regaining ground after Trudeau's resignation. How to respond to Trump's economic threats has become a dominant issue for Canadian voters.</p>

          <p>Economists are warning that the U.S. is at risk of slipping into stagflation, characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment, as a result of Trump's tariff policies. The tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, choking off Americans’ access to affordable goods and materials from overseas. This has the effect of increasing inflation, and slowing growth and increasing unemployment. While economists broadly agree that Trump’s tariffs are likely to produce both higher inflation and slower growth, opinions differ on whether his trade war will lead to a recession or prolonged period of stagflation.</p>

          <p>Bonds are attracting investors as a lower-risk option amidst a stock market downturn driven by President Trump's tariffs. While bond ETFs are rising, experts note a shift towards actively managed bond strategies, which have shown more consistent outperformance than active stock managers. This trend reflects a growing belief that active management can better navigate the complexities of the fixed-income market. This is due to the limitations of core bond indexes and the opportunities available to skilled fixed income managers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon and other Wall Street leaders are expressing concerns about President Trump's tariffs, cautioning they could lead to higher inflation and slow the U.S. economy. Dimon warned that the tariffs would likely increase inflation and cause many to consider a greater probability of a recession. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman criticized the tariffs as launching an "economic nuclear war" and damaging confidence in the U.S. as a trading partner. These warnings highlight the growing unease among financial leaders about the potential economic consequences of the administration's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global bond yields have plummeted as investors seek safe havens amid concerns about President Trump's tariff policies.

Economists warn that the rally may not be sustainable if inflation concerns weigh. Investors are parsing an extreme and unpredictable tariff policy and whether that will lead to a global growth slowdown, a U.S. recession, or changes in the path of central bank policy.

This change is part of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back DEI initiatives across the federal government, which critics view as an attempt to sanitize US history. Similar changes have been made to other government-owned webpages, including the removal of references to transgender people and the contributions of Black soldiers.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with President Trump at the White House to discuss the war in Gaza, Iran’s nuclear threat, and US tariffs. This marks the first effort by a foreign leader to negotiate a deal after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs, including a 17% tariff on Israeli goods. Netanyahu said he was visiting at the invitation of Trump to speak about efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza. The meeting comes as Netanyahu faces pressure at home to return to ceasefire negotiations and secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A Belgian prince's attempt to claim social security benefits on top of his six-figure royal allowance has been rejected by a court. Prince Laurent, the younger brother of King Philippe, argued that he was partly self-employed because of his royal duties and his animal welfare charity. The court disagreed, stating that the prince can be considered neither self-employed nor an employee. However, the judge acknowledged that the prince should actually be entitled to a pension - but said gaps in legislation made that impossible and called for the law to be amended.</p>
