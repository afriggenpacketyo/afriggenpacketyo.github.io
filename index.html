          <p>The parents of a 22-year-old man in San Jose, California, are pleading for justice after their son was fatally stabbed while intervening to protect a friend from an attack. Raymond Orozco, who worked at a group home and was set to attend a fire academy, was remembered by his family as a bright light with the potential to help many people. San Jose police are investigating the homicide and have urged any bystanders who may have recorded the incident on their cellphones to come forward with information to help identify the suspect, who remains at large.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five Canadian ice hockey players who were accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. In her ruling, the judge stated that she did not find the accuser's evidence to be credible or reliable, pointing to inconsistencies in her testimony and memory. The central issue of the trial was whether the woman, who was 20 at the time, had consented to the sexual acts. Lawyers for the former world junior team players argued that she initiated the encounter and that they believed she had given consent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated that he will not seek to harm Elon Musk's companies by cutting the substantial government subsidies they receive. This declaration comes amidst an ongoing war of words between the two, which had previously seen Trump threaten to cut some of Musk's government contracts. In a social media post, Trump asserted his desire for all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to thrive, suggesting a de-escalation in their public feud which has significant implications for companies like SpaceX and Tesla.</p>

          <p>Republican members of Congress are facing increasing pressure from their constituents to push for the release of Department of Justice files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. During recent town halls, lawmakers were questioned about the Trump administration's handling of the files and the perceived lack of transparency. This voter demand highlights a growing divide within the GOP, as some members join a bipartisan effort to compel the release of the documents, putting them at odds with party leadership and the White House.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in England have begun a five-day strike as part of a long-running dispute over pay, prompting the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, to express his deep regret over the situation. Streeting claimed that the doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), did not engage in recent negotiations in good faith. The BMA counters that doctors' pay has been eroded by about 20% in real terms since 2008 and that industrial action is a necessary last resort to achieve pay restoration.</p>

          <p>England has taken firm control of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, thanks to a stellar performance on day two. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, while openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett forged a blistering 166-run partnership. Despite a courageous half-century from India's Rishabh Pant, who batted with a suspected broken foot, England ended the day in a commanding position at 225-2, trailing by just 133 runs with a strong platform to build a match-winning lead.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts stated that he is entirely focused on the new season and has firmly moved on from the team's Super Bowl LIX victory just five months ago. While he appreciated the moment of receiving his championship ring, he emphasized that the past is behind him and that the team is approaching the year as a "new journey" and a "blank canvas." This forward-looking mentality is shared by Coach Nick Sirianni and teammates, who are working to prove themselves all over again rather than defending a past title.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump at a Florida golf course last year, will be allowed to represent himself during his trial.

The judge ordered the attorneys to remain on the case as standby counsel to assist Routh if needed.</p>

The deal imposes a 15% tariff on cars imported from Japan, which is lower than the 25% tariff levied on vehicles that U.S. automakers build in Canada and Mexico. Automotive industry groups have called this a bad deal for American workers, but Lutnick dismissed the complaints as being "ginned up" by public relations efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that California's law requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the law infringes on the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. The majority opinion stated that the state failed to prove the law was consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, a standard set by the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision. This ruling strikes down a first-of-its-kind gun control measure in the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that while President Trump's sweeping tariffs have not yet led to the runaway inflation some predicted, the full impact is likely delayed rather than avoided. Many of the highest tariff rates have not yet taken effect, and businesses have been temporarily absorbing costs or selling from pre-tariff inventory to keep prices stable. Economists expect that consumers will begin to feel more significant price increases on import-sensitive goods later in the year as these temporary buffers are exhausted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the decision between placing $25,000 in a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While current rates show a CD could earn slightly more interest, its primary advantage is the guaranteed fixed rate, which protects against potential market downturns. The article concludes that the best choice depends on individual financial needs, recommending the high-yield savings account for those who prioritize liquidity and access to emergency funds over the small, additional guaranteed return from a CD.
