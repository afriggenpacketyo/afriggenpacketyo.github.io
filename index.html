          <p>The United States and China have mutually agreed to extend a pause on significant tariffs for another 90 days, temporarily averting a potential escalation in their trade conflict. President Trump confirmed the extension via an executive order, maintaining the truce that has kept massive duties on hold. China’s Commerce Ministry announced a reciprocal suspension of its additional tariffs on U.S. goods. This move continues the de-escalation that began in May, which prevented a major economic disruption by halting tariffs that had reached as high as 145% on some products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant heatwave, with temperatures expected to peak as high as 34°C (93°F) in parts of England and Wales. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts, warning of potential travel disruptions and increased strain on health services. Concurrently, a national drought group has declared that England is facing "nationally significant" water shortfalls, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The extreme heat is attributed to warm air from continental Europe, where record-breaking temperatures have also been recorded.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned President Trump that California is prepared to redraw its own congressional maps to counteract a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas. The Texas plan, which aims to create more GOP-leaning districts, has been stalled by state Democrats who left Texas to deny a legislative quorum. In a letter, Newsom called the Texas proposal an "affront to American democracy" and stated that California would act to "neutralize" any gains if the effort proceeds. This escalates a national partisan battle over redistricting, with other Democratic governors also vowing to respond.</p>

          <p>In an unconventional agreement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the federal government 15% of their revenue from AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The deal, confirmed by the White House, allows the companies to sell specific advanced chips, like Nvidia's H20, to the Chinese market after previous restrictions were imposed due to national security concerns. President Trump described negotiating the deal directly with Nvidia's CEO, framing it as a beneficial arrangement for the country.

This method involves filtering water to find genetic traces of the elusive salamander, as traditional net surveys increasingly come up empty. Once abundant, the axolotl population has plummeted from 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in 2014 due to pollution and habitat loss. While eDNA has been found in protected refuge areas, scientists emphasize that large-scale habitat restoration is crucial for the species' survival.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's planned meeting with Vladimir Putin suggests a focus on a bilateral power play, with Ukraine's interests largely excluded from the direct conversation. Trump's framing of the Alaska summit as a "feel out" meeting and his confidence in quickly assessing a deal underscore a dealmaker's approach, but one that raises alarms by sidelining Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. The article notes that the president seems to be positioning himself as a pragmatic mediator, but his emphasis on "land swapping" and dismissal of Zelenskyy's role create a narrative where a resolution could be imposed upon Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting, just days after publicly demanding his immediate resignation over alleged conflicts of interest related to China. The president posted on Truth Social that he and cabinet members had a "very interesting" meeting with Tan and would be receiving suggestions from him. This abrupt change in tone follows a pattern of the administration's heavy-handed involvement in the semiconductor industry as it navigates intense competition with China. Intel's stock rose following the news of the constructive meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the mechanics behind President Trump's decision to federalize the Washington, D.C. police and deploy the National Guard. The action is technically permissible under the D.C. Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control for up to 30 days in an emergency, though the justification of a crime crisis is disputed by recent data showing a 30-year low in violent crime. The move raises significant concerns about the use of federal power over local governance, given the administration's past use of law enforcement against protesters, and what it could mean for police accountability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved the construction of a 51-story apartment tower in the South Park neighborhood of downtown L.A. The project, proposed by a New York developer, is planned to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not commented on a construction start date, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new development. High interest rates, tariffs on materials, and rising labor costs are creating uncertainty for builders, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. residents have varied opinions on President Trump's decision to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard. While protesters and activists see the move as an authoritarian power grab intended to silence dissent, some residents in high-crime neighborhoods expressed cautious optimism that it could improve safety. Many, however, remain skeptical, viewing the action as a political stunt or "red meat" for the president's base that is unlikely to have a lasting impact.
