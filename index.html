          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that limits the ability of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his administration's policies. The ruling stemmed from legal challenges to his executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. Trump, alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi, framed the decision as a major victory against what he described as "radical left judges" attempting to overrule his presidential authority. He specifically praised the opinion authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed to the court, calling her work brilliant.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New Orleans has ordered a Catholic religious order to pay nearly $2.4 million in damages to a 68-year-old man, John Lousteau, who was sexually abused by a member in the late 1960s. This is the first major verdict since a 2024 Louisiana law allowed survivors to sue for damages regardless of when the abuse occurred. The landmark award could influence future settlements, particularly as the New Orleans archdiocese navigates bankruptcy related to hundreds of other abuse claims. The Holy Cross order, found liable as the abuser's employer, is currently evaluating its options.</p>

          <p>A new trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic anxieties like inflation, tariffs, and job security. The U.S. personal saving rate rose to 4.5% in May, a significant increase from 3.5% in December, marking a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending." This cautious behavior is also reflected in record-high 401(k) contribution rates, as consumers prioritize building emergency funds. Financial experts see this as a defensive strategy to create a financial cushion against future uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi made a surprise return to the Glastonbury festival, two years after taking a break to focus on his mental health and Tourette's syndrome. His last performance at the festival in 2023 was cut short when he struggled with his voice, with the crowd memorably singing for him. On Friday, he told the emotional audience he wanted to "finish what I couldn't finish first time around." The comeback coincided with the release of his new single, "Survive," which addresses his personal struggles and determination to overcome them.</p>

At the time, Mills, then a district attorney, had criticized a state drug enforcement agency. The DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility concluded the investigation was proper and found no evidence of misconduct, witness coercion, or politically motivated leaks by authorities. Mills has consistently maintained her innocence and characterized the probe as a smear campaign, a narrative the newly surfaced document challenges.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has conceded to pressure from his own Labour MPs by altering controversial welfare reform plans. The government will no longer apply stricter criteria for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to existing claimants and will fast-track a Â£1 billion work support package. The initial proposal, aimed at saving Â£5 billion annually, faced a significant backbench rebellion of around 120 MPs concerned about the impact on disabled individuals. Starmer stated the revised package strikes the "right balance" after constructive discussions, though some MPs on the party's left still intend to vote against the bill.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Limits Use of Nationwide Injunctions by Federal Judges</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled to restrict the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 decision came from a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that such broad orders often exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. This ruling significantly curtails a tool lower courts have used to check executive power on a national scale.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of parents in Montgomery County, Maryland, allowing them to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving storybooks with LGBTQ themes due to religious objections. Justice Samuel Alito, in the majority opinion, stated that forcing children into instruction that contradicts their family's religious beliefs places an unconstitutional burden on religious freedom. The decision orders the school board to provide advance notice and allow students to be excused. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the ruling could create chaos for public schools by imposing significant administrative burdens.</p>

Analysts attribute the market's strong rebound to calmer trade rhetoric and a rally in technology stocks. Despite the positive momentum, some experts warn of complacency regarding trade tensions and potential market volatility ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

It detonated 27 miles above West Forest, Georgia, with the energy equivalent of about 20 tons of TNT. The space rock was estimated to be 3 feet in diameter and weigh over a ton, and may have been part of the rarely seen Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that his team is in discussions with reigning world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal is believed to contain exit clauses. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations are linked to the outcome of these talks. The potential move is significant due to Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' progress on the new engine regulations for 2026, which could make them a more competitive option for Verstappen.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will hold further arguments in a case concerning Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. The map, created by the Republican-led legislature, was challenged by a group of voters who argued it constituted an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Lawmakers contended the map was drawn to comply with the Voting Rights Act while also protecting incumbent Republicans like Speaker Mike Johnson. The court's decision to reargue the case leaves the current map in place for now but signals continued judicial scrutiny over the complex interplay of race, politics, and redistricting.</p>

Public health advocates had warned that invalidating the task force's recommendations could jeopardize access to crucial services like cancer screenings and HIV prevention drugs for millions of Americans.

Wall Street is buzzing with potential candidates, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. The political pressure comes as the Fed navigates complex economic conditions, and analysts warn that such a move could undermine the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

The exact payout depends on factors like gender and whether it is a single or joint-life policy, with men typically receiving slightly more due to shorter life expectancies. While annuities offer predictable income streams that can provide security in an uncertain economy, they also involve trade-offs such as limited liquidity and potential inflation risk.
