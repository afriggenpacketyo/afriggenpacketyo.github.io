          <h2>Syrian Presidency Announces Ceasefire in Suweida After Deadly Sectarian Clashes</h2>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has declared an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes between local Bedouin tribes and the Druze community. The sectarian violence has resulted in hundreds of deaths, with graphic reports of bodies in the streets. Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for unity as internal security forces, with tacit approval from Israel, deployed to the area to enforce the truce. However, international actors, including Israel, have expressed skepticism about the Syrian government's commitment to protecting minorities, highlighting the fragile nature of the situation.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militant group have signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement in Qatar, committing to a permanent peace deal by mid-August. This agreement aims to address the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced over seven million people. The terms of the final deal are still being negotiated, with key issues including the release of captured fighters and the withdrawal of M23 troops from seized territories. The African Union has hailed the deal as a major milestone for regional stability.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat as Thunderstorm Warnings Issued After Heatwave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 07:14:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain are in effect for most of the United Kingdom, raising concerns about potential flash flooding and travel disruptions. The Met Office alerts follow a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing the risk of rapid runoff. The warnings cover most of England and parts of eastern Scotland, with forecasters cautioning about possible power cuts and delays to transportation services. This weather pattern highlights the challenges of extreme shifts, from drought conditions to sudden, intense rainfall.</p>

          <p>At least 32 Palestinians were killed and dozens more were wounded after Israeli troops reportedly opened fire on crowds seeking food near aid hubs in southern Gaza. The incidents occurred near distribution centers run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israeli-backed group. Eyewitnesses described chaotic scenes of indiscriminate fire, while hospital officials reported receiving numerous casualties with gunshot wounds to the head and chest. The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots at suspects who approached its forces and is investigating the reports of casualties.</p>

          <p>A new meta-analysis claims that vegetarians tend to value power and achievement more than meat-eaters, challenging common stereotypes. The research, which analyzed data from over 3,700 people, found that vegetarians scored higher on values like stimulation and power, while placing less emphasis on security and tradition. The study's author suggests this reflects the strong character required to maintain a minority dietary choice against social pressures. However, critics argue that categorizing individuals based on their diet is an oversimplification and that human motivations are far more complex than such labels imply.</p>

          <p>A concept dubbed the "Gen Z stare" has gained traction online, describing a blank or unresponsive look from younger people in social interactions, sparking a debate across generations. While some Zoomers deny its existence, older generations recognize it as a frustrating lack of engagement. Psychology experts suggest this behavior may stem from a combination of factors, including social development during the pandemic and a life spent interacting through screens. The phenomenon reflects changing social norms and highlights the anxieties of older generations who value different forms of in-person communication and connection.</p>

The city also claims the company's verification processes are inadequate, leaving users vulnerable to fraudulent hosts and other risks.

          <p>Over 100 days into President Trump's sweeping tariff policies, economists are assessing their effects on the U.S. economy. The tariffs have generated higher-than-expected tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in domestic manufacturing. However, analysts caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to push up prices on certain imported goods, risking inflation. Despite initial fears of a recession, the economy has remained resilient, but the recent announcement of further tariffs adds a new layer of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch is rerecording its most popular songs after discovering its former label had sold the master recordings of its first seven albums without their knowledge. Taking inspiration from Taylor Swift's successful "Taylor's Version" project, the band decided to reclaim its work, with the first collection of rerecorded tracks released recently. The move is the latest chapter for the multiplatinum band, which has become one of the most successful metal acts of its generation. The new recordings aim to be faithful to the originals while reflecting the band's evolution.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to kill approximately 450,000 barred owls to protect the threatened northern spotted owl is facing significant opposition. A coalition of Republican lawmakers and animal rights advocates argues the cull is inhumane, expensive, and unworkable over the vast Pacific Northwest region. Supporters, including conservation groups, insist the removal is necessary to prevent the extinction of the spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owl. The plan is now in jeopardy as opponents urge the Trump administration to cancel it and explore a congressional reversal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-protein snacks flood the market, nutrition experts advise consumers to look beyond marketing claims and assess the actual nutritional value. Many products labeled "high-protein" may also be high in sugar or heavily processed. To determine if a snack is a good source, experts suggest a simple calculation: a food should derive at least 30% of its total calories from protein. They also recommend checking the nutrition label for an FDA-defined high-protein snack, which provides 20% or more of the daily value. Ultimately, whole foods like Greek yogurt or nuts are often healthier alternatives.</p>

This has put the administration in conflict with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has kept interest rates on hold to assess the tariffs' full economic impact.
