          <p>In his first broadcast interview since being released from ICE custody, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil spoke with ABC News about his detention and his commitment to advocating for Palestinian human rights. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over three months and still faces the threat of deportation under the Trump administration. He stated that no threat would deter him from speaking out against injustice and that his detention has actually advanced the cause of Palestinian liberation. Khalil also addressed allegations of antisemitism within the Palestinian movement, asserting that there is no place for any form of racism. His release followed a judge's order, which the Department of Homeland Security criticized, and Khalil remains concerned about his safety and the possibility of future detention, but is committed to continuing his advocacy. </p>

          <p>Authorities in Inner Mongolia investigated actress Nashi for allegedly faking documents to enroll in the Shanghai Theatre Academy, highlighting concerns about social justice in China. The investigation was initiated after Nashi hinted online that she had not "played fair" in her college entrance exam 17 years ago. This incident has touched a nerve in mainland China, where a widening wealth gap and social class divisions have made social justice a sensitive issue. The gaokao, China's national college entrance exam, is seen as a crucial tool for social mobility, particularly for those from less privileged backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party in Japan, is gaining traction among younger Japanese with its anti-immigrant stance and calls for constitutional revision. Established in 2020, the party exploits frustrations over economic malaise and increasing tourism, claiming foreigners receive preferential treatment. Sanseito supporters advocate for tighter regulations on foreign land acquisition and restrictions on foreign workers, with some even suggesting a return to wartime slogans. The party's leader, Sohei Kamiya, aims to expand their representation in the upper house, capitalizing on discontent and a sense of national crisis. The party's early support is also attributed to pandemic fatigue, particularly the obligation to wear masks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume expedited deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning or the opportunity to challenge their removal based on potential torture or death in other countries. This decision lifts a previous injunction and will remain in effect during the appeal process, with the Supreme Court's liberal justices dissenting. Justice Sotomayor criticized the ruling as an abuse of the Court's discretion, citing instances where the government wrongfully deported individuals to unsafe countries. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security, while legal groups representing the immigrants expressed concern over the stripping of due process protections.</p>

While some Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized the strikes as a betrayal of the "America First" agenda, others believed the actions aligned with protecting U.S. military and strategic interests. Some voters expressed disappointment, fearing escalation, but overall, Trump's supporters trusted his judgment, citing his access to national security intelligence. A Washington Post poll indicated that 46% of Trump voters supported the airstrikes, while 26% opposed them.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated by launching missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, but all missiles were reportedly intercepted without causing casualties or damage. President Trump stated that Iran's response was "very weak" and suggested that both sides should pursue peace, hinting at a possible ceasefire. Trump's actions are seen as a high-risk maneuver that could yield positive outcomes if further escalation is avoided and negotiations become possible. This situation echoes a similar dynamic in 2020 when Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, but ultimately chose not to escalate after Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the lack of explanation for the strikes and accused the president of potentially misleading the public. Despite the Trump administration's expected briefing for all lawmakers, some members are pushing for war powers resolutions to require congressional approval for military action against Iran. House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's actions, asserting the president acted within his authority as commander-in-chief.

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices. While initial market reactions saw a surge followed by a decline in crude prices, experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, potentially leading to higher gas prices for American consumers. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though unlikely, could send oil prices soaring, impacting economies worldwide, and the potential for Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities also remains a concern (not investment advice).</p>

Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have attempted to downplay the possibility of regime change, Trump's rhetoric suggests a broader ambition. This shift contradicts his previous campaign promises of avoiding foreign wars and has drawn criticism from some non-interventionist Republicans. The situation highlights the tension between Trump's improvisational style and the more consistent ideology of retrenchment and restraint advocated by some of his advisors.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court ruling allows the Trump administration to bypass federal law and an international treaty protecting immigrants from torture, permitting deportations to countries where they may face harm. The ruling, issued without explanation by the Republican justices, allows Trump to send immigrants to countries where they may be tortured while the case is litigated. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the decision rewards lawlessness and undermines due process. The Trump administration claims a loophole allows them to bypass these laws for some immigrants, potentially sending them to dangerous countries like South Sudan and Libya.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without congressional approval has reignited the debate over war powers. The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, but presidents have often initiated military action without formal declarations. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 sought to reassert congressional authority, but presidents have largely ignored it, leading to ongoing disputes. Legal experts disagree on whether Trump had the authority to strike Iran without congressional approval, highlighting the enduring tension between the executive and legislative branches regarding military action.</p>

          <p>Satellite images have emerged showing the extent of damage to Iranian nuclear facilities following U.S. strikes, with varying assessments from officials and experts. President Trump claimed the sites were "completely and totally obliterated," while others suggested a full damage assessment is still pending. Images show damage to Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz, with experts noting potential damage to ventilation shafts and underground facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency has called for access to the sites to assess the full extent of the damage and its impact on Iran's nuclear program. The images provide a visual confirmation of the strikes and allow for preliminary analysis, though a complete understanding requires on-site inspections.</p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan are concerned that a potential US war in the Middle East could strain American military resources, potentially affecting the response to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. With the United States already supporting Ukraine, there are worries that it would have fewer resources and less political attention to respond swiftly should China take action against Taiwan. While Taiwan remains a core US interest, the possibility of America managing two major conflicts simultaneously raises questions about the resources realistically available to Taiwan. The island's defense analysts and lawmakers are closely monitoring the situation to assess the potential impact on regional security.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, conflicting statements have emerged regarding the extent of the damage. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the Iranian nuclear program was "obliterated," while other officials and experts have offered more cautious assessments. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said it will take time to assess the damage, and an Israeli official noted uncertainty about the actual impact and whether materials were moved beforehand. Experts also questioned the effectiveness of the strikes, citing the depth of the Fordo facility and the potential for limited damage.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, legal experts are debating whether President Trump had the authority to order the attacks without congressional approval. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as commander-in-chief. Some experts argue that Article II gives the president authority to use military force in certain circumstances, including preventing nuclear proliferation. Others contend that Trump should have consulted Congress first, as there was no sudden attack to repel. Presidents have historically used their authority to order military actions without congressional approval, leading to ongoing debate about the balance of power.</p>

This marks the lowest opening for a Pixar film and underscores the challenges faced by original animated movies in attracting audiences post-pandemic. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled against competition from other family-friendly releases, and analysts suggest marketing may have been a factor. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience throughout the summer, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and is committed to creating original animated content alongside sequels and franchises.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it due to rising Middle East tensions. Despite China's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing self-interest rather than direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. China's focus remains on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways, even though about 16% of its seaborne crude comes from Iran.</p>
