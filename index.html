          <p>At least nine people were killed after armed men opened fire on patrons at a bar in a coastal tourist city in southwestern Ecuador. The attack is part of a growing wave of violence plaguing the country as transnational drug cartels expand their influence. This incident occurs as authorities grapple with the aftermath of recapturing a major drug lord, Adolfo Macías, who was recently extradited to the United States, and as the nation's homicide rate continues to climb to historic levels.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union has named Steve Tandy as the new head coach for the men's national team, with his contract extending until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy, a former Ospreys coach, leaves his role as Scotland's defence coach to lead his home country. He faces the significant challenge of rebuilding a team that recently hit a record low of 14th in world rankings and endured an 18-match losing streak, aiming to restore their competitiveness on the international stage.</p>

          <p>A new book by author Shawn Levy, titled "Clint: The Man and The Movies," delves into the personal life of Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood, now 95. The biography suggests that Eastwood struggled with the concept of monogamy, viewing traditional marriage as a form of confinement that conflicted with his desire for personal liberty. Drawing from past interviews, the book recounts his numerous affairs during his first marriage, framing his behavior as an "addictive" pursuit that he later acknowledged was not a noble way to live.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece delves into the ongoing debate within the Democratic party about the political alignment of non-voters and whether they represent a path to victory in future elections. While some strategists believe a more populist platform could activate a dormant, left-leaning constituency, recent polling data presents a complex picture. Analysis suggests that while many non-voters are economically populist, they may be more culturally moderate, indicating that a simple shift in either direction may not be enough to win them over.</p>

          <p>A simple legislative change—deleting five words from a 50-year-old federal law—could significantly ease the U.S. housing crisis. The rule requires manufactured homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost, limits design, and creates zoning hurdles. Advocates argue that removing this mandate, which is now being considered by a Senate committee, could scale up production of this affordable housing type, offering relief to first-time buyers and those looking to downsize.</p>

          <p>As WNBA players publicly demand better compensation, this article examines the financial complexities behind their argument. While the league has reported annual losses, key indicators like franchise valuations, broadcast rights, and overall revenue have grown substantially, fueled by rising stars like Caitlin Clark. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far below their male counterparts in the NBA, prompting questions about the league's accounting and whether players are receiving their fair share of the sport's growth.</p>

          <h2>Harvard and Trump Administration Face Off in Court Over Frozen Research Funds</h2>

          <p>Harvard University's lawyers are arguing in federal court against the Trump administration's freeze of over $2 billion in federal grants and contracts. The administration justifies the freeze by accusing Harvard of violating civil rights law by failing to address antisemitism on campus. Harvard contends the action is an illegal attempt to control academic decisions and violates procedural law, threatening vital research in medicine, science, and technology that serves the national interest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, is causing alarm throughout the U.S. coffee industry. Small roasters and industry experts warn that such a steep tariff will inevitably be passed on to consumers, leading to significant price increases for a morning staple. The move comes at a time when coffee prices are already high due to climate change-related harvest issues, adding another layer of volatility for businesses with thin profit margins.</p>

The law dictates that a small number of highly successful investments generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, outweighing all losses and smaller exits combined. Because of this, VCs focus on identifying startups with "outsized-outcome potential"—those that can become massive, category-defining companies—rather than those with more modest growth prospects, as they seek the rare outliers that deliver transformative returns.</p>
