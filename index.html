          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experience of Michelle Renee, a California bank manager who, along with her daughter and roommate, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to the victims to coerce Renee into stealing $360,000. The article details the subsequent investigation, arrests, and trials, where Renee was falsely implicated by one of the perpetrators, Lisa Ramirez. Despite overwhelming evidence of Renee's innocence, the defense attorneys attacked her character, bringing up her past as a stripper and financial difficulties, however, Butler recanted his story, admitting he and Michelle never had a relationship.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market is defying the national slump, with luxury units selling quickly as wealthy buyers seek value-preserving assets. One Central Park, a luxury development in the city's core Huangpu district, sold all 64 units for $556 million, marking the first residential project in China to surpass $1.5 billion in sales this year. New home prices in Shanghai rose in April and May, outpacing national averages, with premium projects like Lujiazui Taikoo Yuan Residences also selling out rapidly.

          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many hospitals in Japan continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for families. A group of physicians and social workers are now denouncing these restrictions as a violation of human rights, particularly for terminally ill patients. The article details a specific instance where a doctor's family was initially barred from visiting his cancer-stricken mother-in-law, with the hospital's contradictory policies raising questions about the efficacy and necessity of the restrictions. While the health ministry recommends balancing visitation and infection control, individual hospitals maintain discretionary power, prompting concerns about potential policy reversions and a call for public advocacy.</p>

According to prosecutors, the victim was then tied up and tortured for several weeks, enduring electric shocks, a saw cut to the leg, and forced crack cocaine use.

          <p>A recent study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners' job stress and stress-related behaviors in their pets, such as whining and restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and behaviors, potentially leading to changes in care routines. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by consciously avoiding work-related thoughts while at home.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico despite fears of harm. The man, who is gay, had been protected from deportation to Guatemala by a U.S. immigration judge's order. The judge found the removal likely lacked due process. The Department of Homeland Security defended the deportation, calling Mexico a safe third option, while the judge criticized the action as sending the man back to a country where he was allegedly raped and kidnapped.</p>

Unions have voiced concerns over outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives call on Labour to deliver on their promises.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist, passed away at the age of 90. Her influential book, "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," challenged conventional views of sexual assault by framing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book contributed to significant legal reforms, including the abolition of the "corroborating witness rule" and the implementation of sexual assault shield laws. While celebrated for her contributions, Brownmiller also faced criticism for her feminist views and assertions about the role of men in perpetuating sexual assault.</p>
