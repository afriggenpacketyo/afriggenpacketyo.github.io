          <p>An Israeli strike in central Gaza tragically killed at least 15 Palestinians, including eight children and two women, as they queued for nutritional supplements outside a clinic, according to a hospital. Project Hope, the aid organization operating the facility, condemned the incident as a clear violation of international law, emphasizing the extreme vulnerability of civilians seeking essential care amidst the conflict. The Israeli military stated it targeted a Hamas member and expressed regret for any uninvolved individuals harmed, while indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas continue with significant unresolved differences. This article underscores the devastating human cost of the conflict and the severe humanitarian crisis gripping the Gaza Strip, where essential services have collapsed.</p>

          <p>Cynthie Jane Ragsdale, a dedicated camp director for nearly 50 years, tragically died in the devastating Texas floods that began on July 4th, becoming one of over 100 fatalities. Her final phone call to her brother, Jeeper, warning him of the rapidly rising water, is credited with saving at least five lives at his own camp, despite her own inability to escape. Jane, remembered as a kind and non-materialistic individual, viewed the Heart O' The Hills camp as her life's love.

          <h2>Pentagon Acquires Major Stake in MP Materials to Secure Rare Earth Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 10:37:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S., by investing $400 million in preferred stock. This strategic move aims to expand MP Materials' processing capacity and magnet production, which are crucial for advanced military weapons systems like the F-35 warplane, drones, and submarines. The initiative seeks to significantly reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries, particularly China, for these critical minerals, which has been a point of contention in trade disputes. This public-private partnership will also finance a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon guaranteeing a minimum price for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr), a key rare earth compound.

          <p>The extensive manhunt for Travis Decker, accused of murdering his three young daughters in Washington, has hit another dead end after a reported sighting in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest proved to be a false alarm. Authorities, including the U.S. Marshals Service, confirmed the man interviewed was not Decker, who is a former military member and survivalist. The girls' bodies were found with plastic bags over their heads and hands bound after their mother reported them missing from a custody visit. The search continues with cadaver dogs, but officials acknowledge no certain evidence that Decker is still alive or in the area.</p>

The agency is already experiencing a significant exodus of scientific talent due to these proposed reductions.

          <p>Former US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that fellow Democrats allowed the US-Mexico border to be 'under siege' during Joe Biden's presidency, admitting that 'Trump was right' on the issue of immigration enforcement. Kerry, a former Democratic presidential nominee, said he told Biden the party had 'missed' on immigration for years, enabling Republicans to gain political advantage. His comments underscore an ongoing debate within the Democratic party regarding their immigration policies, especially as the Trump administration expands efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants nationwide, prompting protests and lawsuits from California cities.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, has provided Congress with text messages and emails suggesting that Trump judicial nominee Emil Bove urged defiance of a court order regarding a mistaken deportation. The messages, released by Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, allegedly show Bove instructing a 'f*** you' response to a court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador. Reuveni, who was fired after questioning these instructions, claims he was threatened and disparaged. The Justice Department denies the allegations, while Bove himself denied any unethical conduct at his confirmation hearing.</p>
