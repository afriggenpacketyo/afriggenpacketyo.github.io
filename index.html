          <p>The International Monetary Fund is advising China to stimulate domestic consumption, address the ongoing property sector issues, and prioritize service industries to counter its economic deceleration and the trade conflict with the United States. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva suggests Beijing should decrease reliance on exports and enhance social protections to encourage consumer spending. The IMF has also adjusted China's 2025 growth forecast to 4% due to the trade dispute's impact, further downgrading the global economic growth forecast to 2.8%.</p>

          <p>Intel reported first-quarter results exceeding expectations but issued disappointing guidance and revealed plans to reduce expenses. The company anticipates lower revenue for the current quarter and expects to break even on earnings, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and fluid trade policies. CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated that the operational expense reductions would include job cuts, particularly for managers, and emphasized the need to regain market share and drive sustainable growth. Intel investors hope Tan can turn around the company and compete effectively in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The fire started in Waretown and spread into Lacey Township, destroying a commercial building and prompting air quality alerts in New York City.

          <p>Federal health officials plan to cut funding to the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), effectively ending one of the largest and longest studies of women’s health. The study, which began in the 1990s, enrolled over 160,000 participants and has significantly influenced medical practice and clinical guidelines, preventing numerous cases of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Researchers hoped to use the findings to understand how to maintain mobility, cognitive function, and detect cancer earlier. The Department of Health and Human Services is terminating contracts for the WHI’s regional centers in September, with limited funding for the clinical coordinating center until January 2026.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's efforts to cut bureaucratic fat in the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have resulted in fewer savings than initially promised, while incurring significant costs. Firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave are estimated to cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the IRS, a DOGE-driven exodus of employees is projected to cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone.</p>

The administration is operating at a tremendous tempo, taking initiative in various spheres, reminiscent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's early presidency.

The administration's driving force comes from primal motivations, enabling rapid and assertive action.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the US military is likely to be reinstated by the Supreme Court, given its history of deference to the military and its current conservative majority. Although the ban may be considered discriminatory, precedents such as Goldman v. Weinberger and Rostker v. Goldberg demonstrate the Court's willingness to allow the military to engage in activities that would violate the Constitution in a civilian context. The decision could significantly harm the US military, as it would lose the expertise of trained personnel.</p>
