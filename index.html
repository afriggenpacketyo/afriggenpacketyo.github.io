        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials have revealed that the attacker who opened fire on a Minneapolis church school was reportedly obsessed with killing children and harbored hatred towards numerous groups. The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, killed an eight-year-old boy and a ten-year-old girl before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators found notes and writings on the legally purchased firearms expressing anti-religious and anti-Semitic sentiments, as well as calls for violence against President Trump. The attack has prompted renewed calls from local leaders, including the Minneapolis mayor, for a ban on assault weapons.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a polarized critical reception, with some praising it as a masterpiece and others calling it self-indulgent. In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney portrays an aging movie star grappling with a midlife crisis, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private reality, with Clooney's performance generating early awards season buzz. The supporting cast includes Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, who also reflect on their own experiences within the Hollywood system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds reports that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is primarily due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, both of which are set to expire on September 30. With EV prices already declining amid softer demand, leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring them, accounting for 70% of transactions in July. The IRS has also clarified that a signed contract and down payment before the deadline will secure the credit, even if the vehicle is delivered later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. The court determined that such an action is illegal without the explicit backing of a bipartisan congressional advisory panel, which currently lacks the members to form a quorum. The ruling comes amid two lawsuits concerning Lake's efforts to significantly scale back the international broadcaster's operations, which the judge noted appeared contrary to statutory requirements. Lake has stated the administration will appeal the decision, asserting the president's authority over the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Public media stations serving rural and tribal communities across the U.S. are warning that tens of millions of dollars in federal funding for critical emergency alert systems are in jeopardy. The Next Generation Warning System grant program, administered by the now-defunded Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), has been plagued by stop-work orders and reimbursement disputes with FEMA. This has left many stations with aging infrastructure and stalled upgrade projects, threatening their ability to provide vital information during emergencies like landslides and extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. As part of the move, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history with $136 million guaranteed. The rift between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones grew after Jones refused to negotiate with Parsons' agent. In return for the 26-year-old defensive star, Dallas will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark.</p>

While the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands saw sales growth, the company's overall performance was dragged down by a 9% decline in comparable sales at its Athleta brand.

Newsom contrasted his collaborative approach with local leaders against what he termed the president's strategy of "militarizing American cities."</p>

The upheaval is centered on a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and scientific integrity between the agency's experts and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Resigning officials cited the "weaponizing of public health" and an inability to brief the Secretary as key issues, raising concerns about political interference undermining the agency's mission during a time of growing public health threats.</p>

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), was abruptly fired by the Trump administration on Wednesday. Primus stated he learned of his termination after returning from an Amtrak event and finding his work phone locked, with no cause given for the dismissal. Rail worker unions have condemned the move, suggesting its timing is related to Primus's stated opposition to a potential $85 billion merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. The White House said Primus did not align with the President's agenda and that new members would be nominated shortly.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a Friday hearing to consider Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's request to block President Trump from firing her. Cook filed a lawsuit challenging the president's unprecedented attempt to remove her, arguing the stated reason—allegations of mortgage fraud—is a "nakedly pretextual" effort to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. The Federal Reserve Act states a governor can only be removed "for cause," and Cook's lawsuit contends the allegations do not meet this legal standard. The case is expected to have significant implications for the central bank's autonomy.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the debate over the Federal Reserve's independence is too narrowly focused on President Trump's political pressure. The author contends that the more significant and enduring danger is "fiscal dominance," where the government's massive and growing public debt forces the central bank's monetary policy to serve fiscal needs, such as keeping borrowing costs low. As interest payments on the national debt consume a larger portion of the federal budget, the pressure on the Fed to suppress interest rates will exist regardless of who is president, ultimately threatening its ability to control inflation.</p>
