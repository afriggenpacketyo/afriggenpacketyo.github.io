          <p>Alaska's governor has issued a state disaster declaration due to the imminent threat of catastrophic flooding from a glacier lake outburst in the Juneau area. The warning is centered on Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier, where water levels have reached or exceeded those seen in previous record flood events. This marks the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding for the state capital, which suffered widespread damage to homes and infrastructure from a similar event last year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in tariffs. This move keeps the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese goods at 30% and China's rate on American goods at 10% while negotiations continue. The talks aim to address a range of complex issues, including the U.S. trade deficit, supply chain security, and China's access to American technology like semiconductors. Analysts believe the extension signals a mutual desire to stabilize the economic relationship and work towards a more comprehensive agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The number of employees on payrolls also saw a modest drop, with the retail and hospitality sectors being the most affected. Despite the slowdown, average wage growth remained at 5% and the unemployment rate was unchanged, suggesting what some economists call a "very gradual cooling" rather than a sharp downturn.

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is open to a deal that would permit Nvidia to sell a downgraded version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. The potential arrangement would involve reducing the chip's performance by 30% to 50% to comply with U.S. national security concerns. This development follows extensive lobbying by Nvidia to maintain access to the Chinese market amid strict U.S. export curbs on high-end semiconductor technology. The move is seen by some as a strategy to keep China dependent on American technology, even if it is not cutting-edge.</p>

          <p>In a joint statement, leaders from 26 of the 27 European Union member states have warned that Ukraine's international borders must not be changed by force. The declaration comes just days before a U.S.-Russia summit on the war and underscores European anxiety that a deal could be struck without Ukraine's input. The statement stressed that the people of Ukraine must have the freedom to decide their own future. Hungary was the sole EU nation that did not associate itself with the statement, highlighting a rare break in the bloc's unity on the issue.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats is expected to surpass 50,000 since the Labour party took power in the UK last summer.

The Conservative opposition has criticized the government's handling of the issue, stating that Labour has "surrendered our borders" amid what they call a historic immigration crisis.</p>

The plan, which Trump described as an effort to rescue the capital from "bedlam and squalor," has been criticized for its vague language and lack of detail about where displaced individuals will go. Advocates for the homeless argue that dismantling camps without providing adequate housing is a counterproductive and punitive approach that violates human and civil rights.</p>

The analysis suggests that this close bond could risk alienating a significant portion of the audience the UFC needs to continue its growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, after a weaker-than-expected jobs report, which he claimed without evidence was faked. The selection of Antoni, who has been a vocal critic of the BLS, has drawn sharp criticism from some economists who argue he is a partisan figure unqualified for the traditionally nonpartisan, technocratic role.</p>

          <p>The parents of Harvey Willgoose, a 15-year-old boy murdered by a fellow pupil at a school in Sheffield, are calling for the court to lift the anonymity order that protects his killer's identity. Harvey was stabbed in the heart with a hunting knife during his lunchbreak. His mother told the BBC that her son's name was "tarnished" during the trial while he couldn't speak for himself, and that the defendant should be named as well. The family is also campaigning for knife arches in schools.</p>
