        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White South Africans are migrating to the United States under a refugee program initiated by former President Donald Trump, citing persecution by the country's Black majority, despite Afrikaners holding a disproportionate amount of wealth and land. The US State Department has received thousands of inquiries from white South Africans seeking resettlement. Trump's executive order prioritizes Afrikaners facing race-based discrimination, referencing a land expropriation law aimed at redressing inequalities from the apartheid era. This expedited resettlement pathway contrasts sharply with the standard refugee process, which typically takes years, reflecting a contentious issue of race and privilege in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a bike accident, regained the ability to walk using a "digital bridge" connecting a brain implant to a spinal cord stimulator. The technology, developed by Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine, allows her to move her paralyzed limbs with her thoughts. The digital bridge bypasses the injury, enabling direct communication between the brain and spinal cord, and has shown promise in restoring movement and improving bodily functions. Carsteanu-Dombi's goal is to walk in a park with her family, highlighting the transformative impact of the technology on her life.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial in Switzerland is helping paralyzed individuals walk again through a brain-spine interface, where a device implanted in the skull enables patients to move their limbs by thinking about it. This technology is developed by neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and neurosurgeon Jocelyne Bloch, who have helped patients like Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a bike accident, regain movement in her legs. The digital bridge connects the brain to a spinal cord stimulator, allowing patients to control their movements with their thoughts. This innovative approach offers hope for restoring mobility and improving the quality of life for those with spinal cord injuries.</p>

          <p>Transnational crime rings are exploiting stolen identities to steal billions of dollars in taxpayer money from federal and state governments, with the problem escalating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fraudsters, often operating from overseas, target government programs with tools like AI deepfakes and synthetic identities. They exploit disaster funding, unemployment benefits, and tax refunds, leaving Americans struggling to access what they're owed. The FBI is working to combat these digital gangs, but faces challenges due to the massive amount of money and the involvement of foreign governments.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound for weight loss, opting for Wegovy, despite research indicating Zepbound's superior effectiveness. This decision stems from secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), limiting patient treatment options. While Caremark claims this lowers drug prices for employers, patients like Ellen Davis, who lost 85 pounds on Zepbound, face forced medication switches. Doctors generally prefer Zepbound for most patients, highlighting the impact of PBM decisions on individualized healthcare and treatment choices.</p>

The decision aims to facilitate humanitarian aid entry, as Gaza faces an Israeli blockade. Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen held captive. Negotiations are ongoing, requiring a temporary halt to Israeli military activity during the handover. The Israeli PM's office acknowledged the release as a gesture to the Americans, but affirmed negotiations will continue under fire, underscoring ongoing tensions and complexities.</p>

          <p>Southern California is anticipating a shift from a record-breaking heat wave to cooler temperatures, with a heavy marine layer bringing mild conditions and potential light rain. Temperatures are expected to drop significantly, with coastal highs in the mid-60s and inland areas around 70 degrees. The change follows a surge in temperatures that shattered records, leading to numerous rescues for heat-related issues. The cooler respite is expected to bring relief after the recent heat wave, with no immediate return to extreme temperatures anticipated.</p>

A 'fast-track' settlement will be established for nurses, engineers, AI experts and others who 'genuinely contribute to Britain's growth and society'.
