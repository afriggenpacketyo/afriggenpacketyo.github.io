          <p>Archaeologists in London have discovered a significant collection of painted Roman wall plaster at a development site. The fragments, found in a pit, once adorned a high-status Roman building and offer insights into ancient Londinium's artistic sophistication. Experts at the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) meticulously reassembled the fragments, revealing vibrant yellow panel designs with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres. The discovery also includes what appears to be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain, as well as ancient graffiti, enhancing our understanding of Roman domestic art and literacy.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is scheduled to visit China, marking his first trip since assuming office in May 2024.

Trade and economic cooperation are anticipated to dominate the agenda, with Beijing keen to reassure Singapore about the Chinese economy's stability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the long-held belief that birds sing at dawn because sound travels farther and more clearly at that time. Researchers from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology analyzed audio recordings of birds in an Indian rainforest and found little support for the "acoustic transmission hypothesis." The study suggests that the dawn chorus is more likely related to birds marking their territory after being inactive at night and communicating about finding food. The researchers examined recordings from 43 locations in the Western Ghats mountain range, focusing on 69 different bird species to compare vocal activity at dawn and dusk.</p>

The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support investments in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities focused on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights.

Despite interceptions by defense systems, some missiles have hit buildings, causing damage and casualties. Prime Minister Netanyahu is seen by some as trying to re-establish himself as a guarantor of Israeli security after the October 7 attacks. While there is widespread support among Jewish Israelis for attacks on Iran, many also fear that the conflict could overshadow efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.</p>

          <p>China and Russia are positioning themselves as voices of reason in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, presenting an alternative to US power. During a phone call, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin condemned Israelâ€™s actions, though Xi's tone was more measured than his foreign minister's. Xi emphasized that major powers should work to de-escalate the situation, in a veiled message to President Trump. Beijing has long accused Washington of being a source of instability in the Middle East and offers to mediate the conflict.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit were not the solution. The government's bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit. The government maintains that these reforms will ensure those who can work are supported, while those with severe disabilities are protected.</p>

          <p>The Japanese matcha industry, which has recently benefited from a surge in global popularity, faces potential challenges due to the threat of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Concerns are rising among experts and tea farmers that increased prices could dampen sales and shrink the global market. The uncertainty has created anxiety within the industry, as it fears losing a promising and lucrative opportunity. Matcha consumption has been rising in Japan even as domestic tea consumption declines.</p>

          <p>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reports that nearly 13 million people have been displaced from their homes in West and Central Africa, a 48% increase since 2020.

Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon host over 80% of the region's internally displaced persons (IDPs).

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart International Group experienced a decline after the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party of China, criticized the company's business model of selling collectibles in sealed "blind boxes." The newspaper warned against the addictiveness of these products, particularly for minors, and called for stronger regulations. The blind box sales model encourages frequent purchases to obtain rare items, with some rare editions having less than a 2% chance of being found. Chinese authorities have previously banned the sale of blind boxes to children under eight years old.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists express animosity toward cities, citing their liberal elites, immigrants, net-zero policies, and outspoken leaders as provocations. Populists often come from more conservative, less privileged areas, and view cities as places of fluid loyalties, challenging their traditional values. The article highlights how cities have changed over the past 30 years, shifting from conservative strongholds to centers of the center-left. This shift has been a bitter defeat for the right, leading to caricatures of urban governance that ignore the political complexity of these places.</p>
