          <p>Newly crowned Summer Grand Sumo Tournament champion Onosato expressed his ability to compete without pressure, securing his second straight title and presumptive promotion to yokozuna. The 24-year-old ozeki dedicated his championship to the people of Ishikawa Prefecture, particularly those affected by the January 1 earthquake.

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has voiced his disapproval of Vladimir Putin following Russia's largest aerial attack on Ukraine. Trump described Putin as "absolutely crazy" and questioned his actions, expressing concern over the casualties. This criticism follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for stronger pressure on Moscow. At least 12 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine after Russia launched 367 drones and missiles, marking the highest number in a single night since the 2022 invasion.</p>
