          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have sharply escalated following India's air strikes on alleged terrorist targets inside Pakistan in response to an attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has vowed to counterattack, raising concerns about a potential full-fledged military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Experts note the strikes might not deter terrorist groups but could provoke adaptation, while India emphasizes its actions were measured and non-escalatory. Both sides continue to exchange fire, with the international community urging de-escalation to avert a larger crisis.</p>

          <p>Apple is requesting a court to halt a recent ruling in its legal battle with Epic Games, which would require Apple to allow developers to include web links for in-app purchases without paying commissions. Apple argues that complying with the order will cost the company significant sums, potentially billions of dollars annually, and reduce consumer choice. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney contends that the ruling forces Apple to compete, while Apple claims that developers are already exploiting the order to bypass in-app purchases. The judge in the case also made a criminal referral, alleging that Apple misled the court regarding its commission policies.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, has apologized for his earlier prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by the second quarter, stating that this target "may be too low." Kendrick's revised outlook is driven by significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and increased institutional investment. He notes that the dominant narrative around Bitcoin has shifted from correlation with risk assets to a strategic reallocation away from U.S. assets. Bitcoin has once again topped the $100,000 level, and Kendrick maintains a bullish stance on the cryptocurrency.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and suggested that more cuts may follow in the coming months, this marks the fourth cut within the past year. The decision to lower rates was influenced by concerns that the global trade war could negatively impact UK economic growth, though a UK-US trade deal was welcomed. The Bank's base interest rate affects rates set by High Street banks and lenders, influencing borrowing costs for mortgages and credit cards, as well as returns for savers.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a decline after the company reported mixed first-quarter results and provided soft guidance for the current period, citing "uncertainty" related to tariffs. While the company's earnings per share and revenue exceeded expectations, its projections for gross profit and revenue growth in the second quarter fell short of analysts' forecasts. Shopify President Harley Finkelstein stated that the expiration of the de minimis isn't expected to have a "meaningful impact" on Shopify in the near term, with roughly 1% of its gross merchandise volume related to imports from China that were subject to the exemption.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow highlights China's critical role in Russia's economic stability amid Western sanctions over the Ukraine war. China has become Russia's top economic partner, with bilateral trade soaring, and is a vital source of energy and manufactured goods. While maintaining neutrality in the conflict, China has strategically purchased discounted Russian oil and gas, bolstering Moscow's wartime economy. However, US secondary sanctions aimed at preventing third-country entities from trading with Russia pose a challenge to further expanding Sino-Russian trade.</p>

          <p>Experts say using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt can be a wise move due to high interest rates, but it's not always the best option. Paying off high-interest debt offers an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, it may not be the best move if your balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or if there are more urgent financial needs or claims against the estate. It's important to address the root cause of the debt to avoid recurring problems.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing increasing dissent from Labour MPs regarding proposed welfare cuts, with some MPs cautioning that the cuts are "impossible to support" without a change in direction. Forty-two MPs have expressed concerns in a letter about the potential impact on disabled individuals and their families, urging ministers to postpone decisions until impact assessments are published. The MPs' letter precedes a vote on a new law to implement the benefits cuts next month.</p>
