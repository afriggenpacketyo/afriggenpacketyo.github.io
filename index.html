          <p>Following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days, President Trump stated he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who intends to increase investments in the United States. Trump mentioned Cook plans to construct numerous plants in the U.S. and increase the amount of Apple's overall U.S. investment. Apple had previously announced intentions to invest $500 billion to expand operations in the U.S., including assembling AI servers in Houston. The tariff pause is anticipated to benefit Apple, as most of its device production occurs in China, and the region is its third-largest market by sales.</p>

His release was viewed as a goodwill gesture toward the Trump administration and a potential opening for broader conflict talks.

          <p>President Trump announced an initiative to lower U.S. prescription drug prices to match those charged in other high-income countries, threatening pharmaceutical companies with price caps if they don't comply. Trump stated the U.S. would no longer subsidize healthcare for foreign countries and aimed for immediate price reductions of 50% to 90%. The plan involves reviving the 'most favored nation' policy, which was previously blocked by courts, and allowing Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at these lower prices. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this, arguing it would stifle innovation and harm profits.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is reportedly considering playing elsewhere for the first time in his career. The two-time NBA MVP is exploring his long-term fit with the Bucks after another early playoff exit. Despite his individual success and a championship in 2021, Antetokounmpo has expressed frustration over not winning a second title. While he is under contract through the 2026-27 season, suitors are expected to increase conversations with the Bucks regarding a potential deal during the upcoming combine.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, both countries are experiencing shifts in domestic politics. In Pakistan, the military, once facing criticism, has regained support due to heightened nationalistic fervor following the conflict. In India, Prime Minister Modi's image as a "defender of Hindus" is bolstered by the government's response to the conflict. Despite the jingoistic sentiment, experts say the common people will bear the economic and civil rights costs of the violence, with increased military interference in Pakistan and potential restrictions in both countries.</p>
