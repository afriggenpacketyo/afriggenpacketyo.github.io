          <p>ABC has suspended its late-night show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel suggested the accused shooter was part of the MAGA movement, drawing widespread criticism. The decision followed pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who hinted at risks to ABC's broadcast license, and a move by Nexstar Media Group to preempt the show on its affiliate stations. ABC's parent company, Disney, is now facing significant political and regulatory scrutiny over the host's comments.</p>

          <p>Orca Wiesblatt, a 25-year-old minor league hockey player, tragically died in a traffic accident in British Columbia, Canada. His agency and his former team, the Athens Rock Lobsters, confirmed the news, remembering him for his passion, kindness, and humility. Wiesblatt, who recently signed with the Allen Americans of the ECHL, was also a dedicated advocate for the deaf community, inspired by his two deaf parents. His younger brother, Ozzy Wiesblatt, made his NHL debut earlier this year with the Nashville Predators.</p>

          <p>A UK Education Select Committee report has strongly recommended against scrapping the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs. The committee of MPs also called for new national minimum standards for special needs support in schools and increased training for all teachers. This recommendation comes as the government prepares to announce reforms for the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system, which has faced financial sustainability challenges despite a rising number of children requiring support. Parent campaign groups have voiced strong opposition to any changes that might weaken the legal protections afforded by the current plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, along with Louisiana, continues to have the highest poverty rate in the United States. Approximately 17.7% of residents, or 7 million people, are unable to afford basic necessities, a figure that has remained largely unchanged since 2023. The report attributes the persistently high rate to the expiration of pandemic-era aid policies, such as the federal child tax credit, which had previously led to a historic low in poverty. Researchers warn that recent federal and state budget cuts to social safety net programs are likely to exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Atletico Madrid 3-2 in their Champions League opener with a dramatic stoppage-time winner from captain Virgil van Dijk. The match at Anfield saw Liverpool take an early 2-0 lead before Atletico fought back to equalize, continuing a trend of late-game heroics for the English club this season. The game also marked the debut of Liverpool's record £125 million signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs of linking up with new playmaker Florian Wirtz despite looking rusty. Manager Arne Slot celebrated the victory but expressed a desire for his team to secure wins more comfortably in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move seen as a cautious response to recent weak jobs reports while still addressing inflation concerns. However, this modest reduction is unlikely to appease President Donald Trump, who has been publicly pressuring the central bank for more significant cuts. The decision comes amid Trump's attempts to exert influence over the historically independent institution, including efforts to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook and the recent appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a member of the Trump administration. This political pressure tests the Fed's commitment to making decisions based on long-term economic health rather than political expediency.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting.

Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the target rate, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut this year. The stability of the Bank rate has a significant impact on borrowing costs for consumers, particularly for new fixed-rate mortgages, which have seen slight decreases recently.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declared that he has "no relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a lack of communication and "eminently political" tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods. Lula criticized Trump for not communicating in a "civilised manner" and stated that his counterpart's relationship is with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil itself. The comments signal a clear breakdown in diplomatic ties between the leaders of the two largest economies in the Americas, even as Lula maintains relationships with other world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is set to hold a high-stakes meeting that could reshape national vaccination policy. The meeting follows the recent ousting of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who alleged she was fired for refusing to pre-approve the panel's decisions. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has replaced the entire committee with new members, some of whom have previously questioned vaccine safety. The panel is expected to vote on recommendations for COVID, hepatitis B, and MMRV vaccines, raising concerns among public health experts that political ideology may override scientific consensus.</p>

          <p>Nexstar, the largest broadcast station group in the U.S., announced it will indefinitely stop airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations. The decision is a direct response to host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments about the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination. This move is particularly significant as Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for a major merger with Tegna. The preemption came shortly after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, publicly condemned Kimmel's remarks and threatened regulatory action against the network, highlighting the immense political and business pressures at play.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has officially declared that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, making him the first U.S. senator to use the term. Citing casualty figures and statements from Israeli officials, Sanders wrote that Israel has waged "an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people." His statement aligns with a recent conclusion from an independent UN commission and follows similar declarations from a growing number of House members. Sanders called for an end to U.S. complicity, demanding an immediate ceasefire and a halt to military aid to the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>The state visit of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to the UK has been an exercise in "fashion diplomacy," with wardrobe choices drawing significant attention. Melania Trump's attire included a striking yellow Carolina Herrera gown for the state banquet and a dramatic wide-brimmed hat paired with a Dior suit. The Princess of Wales, Catherine, wore a golden couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara. These carefully selected outfits are seen as sending diplomatic messages, reflecting a blend of national pride and respect for the host nation during the high-profile visit.</p>

          <p>With public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eroding under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., health experts are directing Americans to alternative sources for reliable guidance. Following allegations that the agency's scientific integrity is being compromised, experts recommend turning to professional medical organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. These groups issue their own science-based recommendations, which are now sometimes at odds with the federal government's stance. This fragmentation of health information presents a new challenge for both healthcare providers and the public.</p>

          <p>In an internal email to staff, the acting director of the CDC, Jim O’Neill, stated that the agency has suffered from "mission creep" and lost public trust. He instructed employees to treat American citizens as "adults who can make their own informed decisions," signaling a shift away from proactive public health guidance. The email, sent on the eve of former director Susan Monarez's testimony about her firing, reflects the new direction under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been critical of the agency's past approaches. O'Neill's message suggests a more limited role for the CDC in public health matters going forward.</p>

Kennedy Jr. The alliance's first recommendations for fall vaccines, including for COVID-19, are based on input from major medical associations.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, bringing it to a target range of 4%-4.25% in a widely expected move. The central bank's updated forecast, or "dot plot," signals the possibility of two more cuts before the end of the year but a more cautious approach in subsequent years. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the move as a "risk management" cut, balancing a weaker labor market against persistent inflation. The mixed signals from the Fed, combining short-term dovishness with a longer-term hawkish outlook, led to an uneven reaction in the financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

This conflict stems from a unique 2000 merger agreement that was supposed to preserve the company's social activism via an independent board.
