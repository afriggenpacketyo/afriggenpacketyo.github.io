          <p>CVS Health announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to a rise in its stock price. The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing significant improvements in its retail pharmacy and Aetna insurance divisions. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna and operational efficiencies in the retail pharmacy business. These gains helped offset a decline in the company's health services segment, as CVS continues its broader turnaround plan which includes cost-cutting measures.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported that its diabetes drug Mounjaro showed significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial, comparing favorably to its older drug, Trulicity. While the primary goal was to prove it was not inferior, Mounjaro also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. This data strengthens Mounjaro's position as a leading treatment for Type 2 diabetes, especially as Trulicity's patent nears expiration. The findings are expected to be submitted to regulators, potentially expanding insurance coverage for the drug in the future.</p>

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell 12% after the company provided a disappointing profit forecast for the upcoming quarter. Compounding investor concerns, CEO Rene Haas indicated that Arm is exploring a potential shift in strategy to design its own processors, a move beyond its traditional business of selling chip architecture. This disclosure has created uncertainty, as analysts note that developing full chip solutions would represent a significant and costly leap for the company. The news overshadowed a quarterly earnings report that was largely in line with expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has broken with a long-standing tradition by no longer explicitly naming its competitors in its annual regulatory report. In its latest filing, the company omitted references to rivals like Apple, IBM, and even its key AI partner OpenAI, which it had previously designated as a competitor. Instead, Microsoft now describes its competition in broader market categories. A company spokesperson explained that the change reflects the dynamic and fast-moving nature of the tech industry, though it marks a departure from the common practice of many other major tech firms.</p>

          <p>The Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which has long maintained a fierce loyalty to Syria, is facing a crisis of identity due to recent sectarian violence in southern Syria. Clashes between Druze factions, Sunni Bedouin tribes, and Syrian government forces have led to significant casualties and disillusionment. Many Golan Druze feel betrayed by Syria's interim government, which they accuse of fueling sectarianism. The conflict has caused some to cross the border to protect relatives, while also amplifying fears about the future of minority groups under Syria's new leadership.</p>

          <p>A 20-minute outage of the UK's air traffic control radar display system caused significant travel chaos, leading to over 150 flight cancellations and ongoing delays. The system, managed by NATS, was quickly switched to a backup, but traffic was reduced for safety, creating a major backlog. This is the second major failure since August 2023, prompting sharp criticism from airlines like Ryanair, which called for the NATS CEO to resign. Officials have stated there is no evidence of a cyber attack, but the incident has raised serious questions about the resilience of critical national infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals aimed at tackling the issue of late payments to small businesses. Under the new plans, large companies with more than 250 employees could face significant fines if they persistently fail to pay their suppliers on time. The proposals also seek to limit invoice payment terms to a maximum of 60 days. The government estimates that late payments, totaling £26 billion at any given time, are responsible for the failure of thousands of small businesses each year, and this move aims to improve their cash flow and stability.</p>

Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, held steady at an annual rate of 2.8%.

          <p>A recent episode of "South Park" is being analyzed not for its direct mockery of Donald Trump, but for how it uses the president as a vehicle to critique its parent company, Paramount. The article suggests the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, pivoted from direct political satire to a more layered approach. The episode's plot, involving a lawsuit against the town, is seen as a thinly veiled reference to Paramount's recent legal settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." This strategy allows the show to make a pointed, industry-focused critique while using a high-profile figure to attract a broader audience.</p>
