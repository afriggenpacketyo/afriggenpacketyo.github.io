            <p>Robert Baker, convicted of murdering famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, claims his ex-lover Monica Sementilli was unaware of his plans. Despite facing life without parole, Baker insists Monica did not conspire with him to kill her husband. Prosecutors allege overwhelming circumstantial evidence against Monica, but no direct evidence links her to the conspiracy. Baker's assertion could significantly impact Monica's upcoming trial, where she faces murder charges and maintains her innocence. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prosecutors argue that the jailhouse love affair between Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker reveals further evidence of a murder conspiracy to kill Monica's husband, Fabio. Despite being incarcerated, their relationship continued through intercepted letters, recorded phone calls, and engineered encounters. Prosecutors allege coded phrases and promises of loyalty indicate a "secrecy pact" between the two. The defense argues the affair is irrelevant to proving a murder conspiracy, but the prosecution claims it demonstrates their commitment to each other and the crime. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rami Malek stars as Charlie in “The Amateur,” a spy thriller about a CIA decoder who seeks vengeance for his wife's murder. The film, directed by James Hawes, boasts a talented cast and stylish direction. However, the story lacks suspense and the plot unfolds predictably, failing to deliver a thrilling experience. The film is more of an emotional journey than a rip-roaring one, but why would we prefer the former over the latter in this context?</p>

Earlier on Friday, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman said that Trump’s tariffs action “has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance”, and was destined to become “a joke in the history of the world economy”.</p>
