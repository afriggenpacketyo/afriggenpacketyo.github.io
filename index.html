          <p>Storm Floris has struck parts of the United Kingdom with winds exceeding 80mph, leading to significant travel disruptions and power outages. Scotland experienced the most severe weather, where over 22,000 properties lost electricity and numerous flights, trains, and ferries were canceled. An amber weather warning for a "threat to life" was issued for most of Scotland, with other warnings covering parts of Northern England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The storm, the sixth of the season, also forced the cancellation of events at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and delayed the delivery of student exam results.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is launching a grand jury investigation into the intelligence surrounding the 2016 presidential election and Russia. This action, ordered by Attorney General Pam Bondi, follows a criminal referral from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard recently declassified files that she claims show a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to manipulate intelligence against Donald Trump. Democrats have strongly refuted these allegations, citing bipartisan findings that confirmed Russian interference and accusing Gabbard of misrepresenting the information.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Sean "Diddy" Combs's latest request for bail, ensuring he will remain in jail until his sentencing in October. The judge ruled that Combs failed to demonstrate he was entitled to release, citing evidence of violence in his personal relationships. Combs was convicted in July on two prostitution-related charges but was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering counts. Despite concerns raised by his attorneys about conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center, the judge stated that staff have been able to keep him safe.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state police to find and arrest Democratic legislators who fled Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan. The state's House Republicans voted to authorize the House sergeant-at-arms to issue civil arrest warrants to compel the lawmakers' return and establish a quorum. The Democrats left the state to block a special session aimed at passing a new congressional map that could create up to five new GOP seats. The warrants have no legal power outside of Texas, creating a tense political and jurisdictional standoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis indicates that the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has significantly overstated its cost-cutting achievements. The review focused on three large canceled contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services, for which DOGE claimed $6.4 billion in savings. However, the analysis of transaction records suggests the actual savings are around $165 million, which represents the unspent obligated funds. Critics, including a fellow from the American Enterprise Institute, have labeled the agency's public accounting as "transparency theater" and its savings claims as fiction.

          <p>A convicted felon in Florida, wanted for attempted first-degree murder, has been arrested after being on the run for over two years. The dramatic capture occurred after the 27-year-old suspect, D’Architray L. Sapp, allegedly ran into an apartment to evade police and later knocked down a female officer while attempting to flee. The officer was not injured, and Sapp was apprehended after two officers successfully deployed their stun guns. He now faces new charges of battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest, in addition to his outstanding warrants.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Health is warning of the dangers of consuming raw, unpasteurized milk after an outbreak sickened 21 people, including six young children. The illnesses, caused by E. coli and campylobacter bacteria, have been linked to a single farm and resulted in seven hospitalizations. Although selling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in Florida, it can be sold as pet food. Public health agencies like the FDA and CDC advise against drinking raw milk due to the risk of life-threatening bacteria, which are eliminated through pasteurization.</p>

          <p>California is on track for one of its most severe wildfire seasons in recent memory, with the total acreage burned this year already far exceeding the five-year average. The increased activity is largely driven by fires in Central and Southern California, where limited winter rain has left vegetation exceptionally dry. The state's largest active blaze, the Gifford fire, has scorched over 65,000 acres and is exhibiting erratic behavior. Officials are concerned that an impending heatwave will further elevate the fire risk across the southern half of the state.</p>

In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of asylum seekers directly from France, provided they pass security and eligibility checks. The plan, which has received approval from the EU Commission, is intended to undermine the business model of human smuggling gangs as the number of crossings has risen sharply this year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to "substantially" increase tariffs against India due to its ongoing purchase and resale of Russian oil. India has become one of Moscow's largest oil customers since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a move that Trump claims shows India doesn't care about the conflict. India's foreign ministry called the threat "unjustified and unreasonable," stating its oil purchases helped stabilize global energy markets. The warning marks a significant escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and India, its largest trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has approved an interim compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth approximately $29 billion in company shares. A special committee stated the award is a "good faith" effort to motivate Musk to remain focused on Tesla as it pivots to AI and robotics. This new plan comes while a previous, much larger $55 billion package from 2018 is still being contested in a Delaware court. The board has clarified that if the 2018 plan is ultimately approved through legal appeals, this new $29 billion award will be voided. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has endorsed a controversial migrant detention center in South Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a model for a new national strategy. She plans to launch similar state-run facilities at airports and jails across the country to detain and deport unauthorized migrants more efficiently. The Florida facility, located in the isolated Everglades, has faced legal challenges and accusations of inhumane conditions. Critics also question the legality of state-run immigration detention, as it is typically a federal responsibility.</p>

The visit was immediately condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry as a violation of international law that undermines peace efforts.

          <p>As smoke from Canadian wildfires triggers air quality alerts across the Northeast and Upper Midwest, health experts are highlighting the significant risks of exposure. Pulmonologists compare breathing air with a high AQI level to smoking a quarter to a half pack of cigarettes a day. This exposure is particularly harmful for children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with pre-existing conditions like asthma. Experts advise staying indoors with windows closed, running an air filter, and wearing a well-fitted N95 mask if going outside is unavoidable to limit health impacts.</p>

The article focuses on his use of humor and pride to address the serious issue of illegal immigration, exemplified by his song “Un Mojado Sin Licencia” (A Wetback Without a License). This track, and others like it, transformed the painful experience of undocumented immigrants into a story of resilience and joy.

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack has warned that Americans could face higher inflation in the coming year as businesses start passing the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs on to consumers. She noted that many businesses had initially absorbed these costs by selling through existing inventory but are now facing squeezed margins. Hammack also described a "two-speed economy," where high-income individuals are thriving while low-income households struggle with rising costs. This situation creates a complex challenge for the Fed as it balances inflation concerns with a weakening job market. (not investment advice)</p>
