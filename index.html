          <h2>UK Ministers Consider Removing Two-Child Benefit Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 05:48:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, which restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has contributed to poverty but cautioned that reversing it would be expensive. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, is assessing the cap as part of a broader child poverty strategy, with a decision expected in the autumn. While a Labour government would never have introduced such a cap, the taskforce is weighing the costs of both action and inaction, as the latter can significantly harm children's life chances.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies against "woke" initiatives, particularly Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs, are causing some US corporations to scale back or eliminate these programs, which is now impacting European firms. Some German companies, like Volkswagen and Deutsche Telekom, are reducing their DEI efforts in the US, while others, such as BMW and Siemens, are closely monitoring the situation but maintaining their commitment to diversity. Despite the backlash, many companies, including Apple and Microsoft, are reaffirming their support for DEI, with some rebranding and reorganizing to avoid potential lawsuits. While some companies may change how they communicate their DEI efforts, their core attitudes and actions largely remain the same, with many still launching initiatives to attract women, people with migrant backgrounds, and older workers.</p>

He urged the U.S., Europe, and other nations to impose stronger sanctions on Russia to compel a ceasefire and demonstrate respect for diplomacy.

The P.C.A.O.B. has improved audit quality through rigorous inspections and enforcement, but its independence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) is crucial. Transferring its responsibilities to the S.E.C. would risk losing oversight of overseas companies and increase the likelihood of financial fraud.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece analyzes President Trump's recent redecoration of the Oval Office, characterizing it as a "gilded rococo hellscape" and linking it to American cultural tendencies. The author argues that Trump's aesthetic, while seemingly French, is deeply American, reflecting a desire for ostentatious wealth and a fascination with royalty. The redesign includes golden objects, Rococo wall appliqu√©s, and a gallery hang of presidential portraits, with gilded mirrors that allow visitors to see themselves among the pantheon of leaders. The author suggests that this embrace of Rococo reflects a broader American trend of conspicuous consumption and a longing for the perceived stability of the past.</p>

          <p>Actor Zachary Levi says his public endorsement of President Donald Trump has made him a Hollywood outsider, with some industry professionals reportedly unwilling to work with him. Despite this, Levi claims he has allies who appreciate his willingness to take a stand and are more inclined to hire him. Levi also believes many in Hollywood secretly voted for Trump but are afraid to express their views publicly due to fear of backlash. He encourages "closeted conservatives" to speak out, arguing that the industry's influence is waning.</p>

          <p>Corporate America's scaling back of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives has led to the elimination of thousands of jobs, with over 2,600 DEI-related positions cut since early 2023. This retreat is driven by a backlash from conservative influencers, activists, and officials who argue that DEI is discriminatory. Companies like Verizon, Walmart, and Target have ended or renamed DEI policies, impacting professionals like Candace Byrdsong Williams, a global director of DEI who was laid off and now faces a challenging job market. While some companies claim to remain committed to diversity, the reduction in DEI roles and the public vilification of the profession are concerning to veterans in the field.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has called on domestic universities to consider temporarily accepting students enrolled at U.S. schools, particularly those affected by the Trump administration's move to bar foreign students from Harvard University. This follows the University of Tokyo's consideration of accepting international students from Harvard impacted by the policy. The Japan Student Services Organization plans to release each university's stance on providing support, as the education ministry aims to guarantee education for ambitious young people.
