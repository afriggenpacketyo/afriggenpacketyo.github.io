          <p>The UK government has signed an agreement with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services. The deal aims to boost productivity in sectors like education, defense, and the justice system, with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stating AI will be fundamental to driving economic growth. The memorandum of understanding includes provisions for developing safeguards and an information-sharing program to manage security risks. While the government is eager to adopt AI, the move has drawn criticism from groups concerned about issues like copyright and data privacy.</p>

          <p>A Bangladeshi air force training jet crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, killing at least 27 people and injuring over 170. The F-7 jet reportedly experienced a mechanical failure shortly after takeoff, with the pilot, who also died, attempting to steer it toward a less populated area. Eyewitnesses, including students and teachers, described the horrific scene of the plane hitting a building and bursting into flames at the end of the school day. The interim government has declared a national day of mourning for the victims, many of whom were children and parents waiting on campus.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man from Brooklyn has been arrested and charged with setting fire to eleven New York Police Department vehicles in June. The suspect, who has a history of arrests at pro-Palestinian protests, pleaded not guilty to the federal arson charge. Surveillance footage allegedly shows him scaling a fence into a police vehicle lot, and investigators found a lighter with his fingerprints at the scene. The damage to the vehicles is estimated at $800,000, and officials have emphasized that setting police vehicles on fire is a federal crime, not a form of protest.</p>

          <p>Malcolm-Jamal Warner, the actor celebrated for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed his death was an accidental drowning at a beach on the country's Caribbean coast, where he was reportedly pulled out to sea by a current. Warner's career extended well beyond the iconic sitcom, including roles in "Malcolm & Eddie" and "The Resident," as well as directing and music, earning a Grammy in 2015.

          <p>The Ryde Hotel, a historic property in the California Delta, is searching for dozens of its resident peacocks after they were reportedly stolen. A guest witnessed two men forcing a peacock into a cage, and a subsequent headcount revealed only four of the flock of several dozen birds remained. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony due to the high value of the birds, which could be worth thousands of dollars. Hotel staff are concerned the peacocks may have been taken for the black market exotic animal trade or even for their meat.</p>

          <p>Documents from the UK's National Archives reveal that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while at 10 Downing Street. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair acquired over £75,000 worth of clothes for just £31,000, thanks to "wholesale" prices negotiated by her personal shopper. The files show that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and whether these benefits needed to be declared under a new ministerial code. Memos suggest officials advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts to avoid allegations of preferential treatment.</p>

          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This surge is attributed to high demand from tenants and an insufficient supply of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to make career decisions based on local rent affordability and leading parents to financially support their adult children. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, especially in major cities, more affordable areas are still experiencing sharp annual rises.</p>

The presence of official serial numbers indicates the fighters are part of a low-rate initial production run.

A key detail from the cockpit voice recorder indicates that the fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" moments after takeoff, with one pilot asking the other why they did it. This has led to widespread media speculation, with some reports suggesting a focus on the senior pilot, which has angered Indian pilot associations and been called "premature" by investigators.

The accusations come as the administration faces pressure over its handling of the Epstein files, including a decision not to release additional information.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a "silver lining." The author suggests the tariffs are exposing the hypocrisy of other countries and trading blocs, such as Canada, China, and the EU, which maintain their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly prompting some of these nations to address and remove long-standing domestic obstacles to commerce and trade. This could potentially unlock economic growth that was previously stifled by their own protectionist policies, creating an unintended positive outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge sentenced former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison to 33 months in prison for using excessive force during the 2020 raid that resulted in Breonna Taylor's death. The judge declined a Justice Department recommendation for no prison time, stating she was "startled" more people weren't injured by his 10 shots, which entered a neighboring apartment. Hankison is the only officer to be sentenced to prison in the case, which became a focal point for protests against police brutality. The article notes that the Trump administration also canceled a consent decree with the Louisville police department.</p>

In a podcast interview, the 76-year-old singer-songwriter mentioned he is still working on his balance but that the condition sounds worse than he feels. NPH, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, forced Joel to cancel a series of concerts in May. He is currently undergoing physical therapy and has expressed a commitment to prioritizing his health and recovery.</p>

          <p>Political commentator Tucker Carlson has disputed President Trump's claim that he called to apologize for recent comments. Trump had alleged that Carlson apologized for accusing the president of being "complicit" in Israel's military actions against Iran. In a new interview, Carlson stated that the apology call never happened, though he added that he still likes Trump and agrees with him on many issues. The disagreement stems from a newsletter where Carlson was critical of the administration's stance, prompting Trump to call him "kooky" on social media.</p>

          <p>The United States is taking action to deport lawful permanent residents who are accused of supporting violent gangs in Haiti. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move would target individuals who have facilitated the actions of Viv Ansanm, an armed alliance controlling much of Haiti's capital, which the U.S. designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The announcement came as a prominent Haitian businessman and former presidential hopeful was reportedly arrested by federal agents in Miami. The policy reflects an effort to prevent individuals from using legal U.S. status while supporting criminal organizations abroad.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI records related to the surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from his family. The release is part of an executive order to declassify files connected to the assassinations of major 1960s figures. King's children issued a statement urging the public to view the files in the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit their father and the Civil Rights Movement. They also reiterated their belief that King was killed as part of a wider conspiracy, a finding a 1999 civil case supported.</p>

He dubbed the group "PARC," noting they represent a separate track in the market from the S&P 500, where a handful of names are relentlessly pushed up by passionate buyers. Cramer suggests that while these stocks are trendy, they also have seemingly solid earnings and analyst attention.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter. This acceleration, caused by factors like the moon's pull and changes in the planet's core and atmosphere, has led to the shortest day on record since atomic clocks were introduced. This trend could eventually require an unprecedented "negative leap second" to be subtracted from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep clocks in sync with the planet's rotation. Experts note that while climate change-induced ice melt is currently counteracting this speed-up by slowing the rotation, the potential need for a negative leap second raises concerns for computer systems reliant on precise timekeeping.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is using the judicial system to push its policy agenda, a strategy bolstered by recent Supreme Court rulings that have expanded presidential immunity and curbed lower courts' power. The administration has been described as launching an "unprecedented attack" on federal district judges who have blocked its executive orders, with the president and his staff using inflammatory rhetoric against them. While critics argue this approach is eroding the system of checks and balances, the administration contends it is fighting against judicial overreach and fulfilling the will of the electorate.</p>

This sentencing is notable as the Trump administration's Justice Department had recommended only a one-day sentence, a position that contrasts sharply with the previous administration which brought the charges. Hankison is the only officer to be convicted and sentenced in connection with the raid, which became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
