          <p>An Iranian missile strike wounded 23 people in northern Israel, including a 16-year-old boy who suffered shrapnel wounds. The attack occurred as European foreign ministers met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva to negotiate a settlement to the conflict. Araghchi stated that Iran is open to dialogue but will not negotiate with the United States as long as Israeli strikes continue. Israel's military reported striking 25 military and nuclear targets in Iran earlier that day, and at least 657 people have been killed in Iran and 24 in Israel during the week of war.

He played various characters on "Hee Haw" for 20 years and also starred in the spin-off, "Hee Haw Honeys."

Critics argue that larger bills could push more borrowers into default, while Republicans claim the bill helps those who chose not to go to college. (not investment advice)</p>

Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers will need to weigh the guaranteed interest they can earn with a CD versus the slightly more they can maybe make with a money market account to determine which is their most profitable option.

          <h2>California Challenges Troop Deployment After Appeals Court Ruling Favors Trump</h2>

          <p>California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles returned to court after an appeals court allowed Trump to maintain control of National Guard troops. The state is seeking a preliminary injunction to return control of the troops to Governor Newsom, arguing that their presence inflames tensions and usurps local authority. Trump has asserted that the troops are necessary to restore order amid protests over immigration raids. This marks the first deployment of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since 1965.</p>

          <p>The food industry is increasingly adding protein to various products, from iced tea to popcorn, reflecting Americans' growing obsession with protein. This trend has led to the creation of protein-fortified versions of everyday foods, including protein water, protein pasta sauce, and even protein-infused alcoholic beverages. While some experts believe increased protein intake is beneficial, most agree that the average person does not need to consume excessive amounts. Food companies are capitalizing on the perception of protein as "healthy" to make their products more appealing, but consumers should be wary of the nutritional value of these protein-enhanced items.</p>
