          <p>This article discusses a recent study that suggests high doses of radiation therapy, commonly used to treat cancer, may paradoxically promote the distant metastasis of tumors. Researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre found that high doses of radiation could lead to the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly targeted by the radiation. This surprising finding highlights the need for further research into the complex effects of radiation therapy on cancer progression.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has reached a tentative agreement with blue state Republicans to increase the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for households earning less than $500,000 per year. This proposal is part of President Trump's tax bill. The article notes that it is unclear whether GOP hardliners who oppose raising the SALT cap will support the measure, as Republicans from lower-tax states are wary of incentivizing blue states’ high-tax policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for a comprehensive missile defense shield, dubbed the “Golden Dome,” aimed at protecting the United States from foreign missile threats. Trump asserted that the system would be operational by the end of his term, capable of intercepting missiles from any location, including space. Experts, however, cite logistical and financial challenges, with cost estimates ranging from $161 billion to $542 billion. The project draws parallels to Ronald Reagan's 'Star Wars' initiative, which faced similar technological and budgetary obstacles.</p>

The article criticizes the male gaze in media, which prioritizes men's views and reinforces far-right narratives. It suggests that center-left parties should focus on the priorities of female voters, such as climate action and social welfare, to transform the political debate and mobilize young women.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants deported to South Sudan, amid concerns that the deportations violated an earlier court order. The judge is investigating whether the administration deported migrants to countries other than their own without providing sufficient opportunity to contest their removal. The order requires the government to identify the affected deportees and provide details about their removal and the opportunity each individual had to raise a fear-based claim.</p>
