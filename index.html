          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and de-dollarization discussions continue, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming increasingly vital for China's yuan to achieve international prominence. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are eager to use the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools for trade and investment. This trend highlights the impact of the US trade war, prompting businesses to seek alternatives to the US dollar. China's strategy to internationalize its currency, dating back to 2008, aims to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NHS England plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to provide immediate care. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails the model as pioneering, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and robust testing before national rollout. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people waiting over 12 hours in A&E, underscoring the urgency of addressing mental health service gaps.</p>

          <p>The New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition technology, specifically cameras run by Project N.O.L.A., is under scrutiny during the manhunt for escaped inmates. Despite a recent pause in automated alerts to officers, the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive. Civil rights organizations and politicians raise concerns about privacy and constitutional rights, citing the lack of public awareness and potential for misuse. Project N.O.L.A. operates approximately 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates to assist in solving various crimes, including homicides and sexual assaults.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1 as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's placement, which has since been moved. Federal air traffic controllers also reported difficulty in accurately tracking the helicopter's location. The incident heightened concerns about close calls between military and commercial aircraft, prompting the Army to temporarily pause flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to enhance safety measures.</p>

Ha believes there is growth potential in collaborating with the Japanese government in the defense sector, as few startups in Japan are willing to engage in this area. He emphasizes the critical role of AI in bolstering information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity. Ha also suggests that the increasing U.S.-centric approach could lead to AI becoming a bargaining chip, underscoring the importance of Japan's independent AI development.</p>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with alternatives as domestic rice prices reach record highs. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price than Japanese-grown rice, following similar moves by Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options due to higher prices. The average price of rice sold at Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high due to a poor harvest in 2023, making the availability of foreign-grown rice a welcome option for consumers.</p>

Many ex-smokers credit disposable vapes with helping them quit cigarettes, but concerns about environmental impact and youth vaping have prompted the ban. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, while some worry the ban will lead to a return to smoking. The government aims to reduce environmental harm and cut youth vaping, though critics argue the ban may be counterproductive for public health.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a 767-kilometer canal linking the resource-rich Jiangxi province to the wealthy coastal Zhejiang province, part of a broader effort to enhance inland water transport. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is expected to become the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of $44.4 billion. The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Once completed, the canal would connect Jiangxi province to seaports in Zhejiang, accommodating 1,000-tonne vessels and handling around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has moved to curtail press access inside the Pentagon, citing concerns over leaks of classified and unclassified information. The new restrictions limit reporters to a specific area and require escorts for movement elsewhere in the building. Hegseth has taken an adversarial stance toward the news media, including ejecting several news organizations from their workspaces. The Pentagon Press Association criticized the restrictions as an attack on the freedom of the press, questioning Hegseth's lack of press briefings.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has called for a trade deal with the U.S. based on "respect" rather than "threats," following President Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods.

Sefcovic emphasized the EU's commitment to securing a deal that works for both parties. EU leaders have stressed de-escalation and negotiation as the best way forward.</p>

The band's performance followed a smaller "secret" set and included a new track referencing the counter-terrorism investigation.

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to dispatch hundreds of border agents to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in arresting unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. interior. This plan would involve around 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Border Patrol agents and members of the Office of Field Operations. CBP agents and officers assigned to the effort are expected to assist their counterparts in ICE's 25 field offices by supporting immigration enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally. This effort highlights the Trump administration's government-wide campaign to find the manpower necessary to scale up its crackdown on illegal immigration.</p>
