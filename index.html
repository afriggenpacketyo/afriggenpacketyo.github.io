          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is ending lawsuits against police departments in Louisville and Minneapolis, reversing investigations launched during the Biden administration following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The decision also closes investigations into police departments in Phoenix, Trenton, Memphis, Mount Vernon, Oklahoma City, and the Louisiana State Police. The Trump administration argues that consent decrees sought by the Biden administration were overly broad and would subject local departments to years of micromanagement by unelected bureaucrats with an anti-police agenda. This move marks a significant shift from the Obama and Biden administrations' focus on civil rights issues and police accountability.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose surged 20% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates, although it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite this, Canada Goose expressed confidence in its brand strength, financial position, and ability to adapt to changing conditions.

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix, a historic Formula 1 race known for its glamour and challenging circuit, faces criticism for its lack of overtaking opportunities in recent years. The narrow, winding streets of Monte Carlo make it difficult for drivers to pass, leading to predictable races. Qualifying on Saturday is often considered the most exciting part of the weekend, as the race outcome is frequently determined by grid position. Four-time champion Max Verstappen described the 2024 race as "really boring," highlighting the need for potential changes to improve the spectacle.</p>

Companies ignoring these insights risk talent attrition, rising costs, and reduced agility in an era that demands adaptability. Flexibility is now a key driver for talent acquisition and retention, with remote work removing geographic barriers for candidates facing caregiving, disabilities, or rural isolation.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the pros and cons of investing in callable CDs, noting that while they offer higher interest rates than traditional CDs, they also come with the risk of the bank recalling the CD before its full term. Experts suggest that callable CDs are worth considering if the interest rate is significantly higher and if investors have a solid reinvestment strategy in case the CD is called early. However, if stability and predictability are top priorities, a traditional CD or high-yield savings account might be a better fit. (not investment advice)</p>
