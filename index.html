          <p>Early Friday morning, Israel launched a preemptive strike against Iran, targeting its nuclear facilities, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The United States was not involved in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating that Israel believes the action was necessary for its self-defense. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared it a targeted military operation to remove the Iranian threat to Israel's survival, while Iranian state media reported explosions and casualties in Tehran. The IDF spokesperson said that the military "launched a preemptive, precise, combined offensive based on high-quality intelligence to strike Iran's nuclear program, and in response to the Iranian regime's ongoing aggression against Israel." Optimism for regional stability following these events is low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that the federalization of the Guard without Newsom's consent was illegal, exceeding Trump's statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment. Newsom praised the order as a check on Trump's authoritarian tendencies, while the Justice Department swiftly appealed the decision. The judge stated that the protests in Los Angeles "fall far short" of rebellion and that the administration did not identify a "violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole."</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. The study, analyzing early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This suggests that the domestication of wild boars coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The findings provide new insights into the origins of pig domestication and its relationship to early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential chaos and increased risks. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts currently split among multiple agencies.

Critics argue this restructuring could be costly and disruptive, potentially increasing the likelihood of catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a novel "Trojan horse" therapy for myeloma, a type of blood cancer. This treatment, belantamab mafodotin, delivers chemotherapy drugs directly into cancer cells, prolonging remission periods compared to existing therapies. Clinical trials have shown that it can halt the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current treatments. One of the first patients to receive the therapy reported it to be "life-changing", allowing him to resume a normal life.</p>

          <p>Caravan buyers have reported being misled, ripped off, and even threatened by holiday parks, according to a BBC investigation. Allegations include misleading claims about rental income, steep increases in site fees without warning, and pressure to sell caravans back to parks at significantly reduced prices. One couple reported receiving veiled threats after seeking legal advice. The holiday park sector is described as largely unregulated, leaving buyers vulnerable to unfair contract terms and practices.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in his role as health secretary, has dismissed the expert committee advising the CDC on vaccine recommendations and is replacing them with individuals holding similar views on vaccines, specifically those who have publicly spoken out against COVID vaccines. Critics argue this move undermines the scientific consensus on vaccination and erodes trust in immunization. The new appointees include individuals who have questioned the safety of COVID vaccines and falsely linked them to deaths. This remaking of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) could have significant consequences for national preparedness against infectious diseases.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates that President Trump's proposed megabill would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while reducing resources for the poorest. The analysis projects that the lowest-earning 10% of households would experience an income cut of approximately $1,600 per year, while the top 10% would see gains of about $12,000 per year. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amid objections from Democrats, and preparations were underway in Washington for a massive military parade.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi is spearheading an initiative to lower rice prices amid rising household burdens, drawing comparisons to his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move has put Koizumi back in the spotlight after his third-place finish in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership race. Koizumi's actions include releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices to retailers, addressing controversial issues in the agricultural sector.

          <p>The Trump administration is renaming military bases that were previously named after Confederate generals, but the Pentagon's official announcement subtly differs from Trump's claims. While Trump stated that the names of Confederate figures would be restored, the Pentagon said the bases would instead be named after other veterans with the same surnames. Critics view this as a wink-and-a-nod trolling strategy, suggesting that the administration is trying to appease supporters of Confederate symbols without explicitly acknowledging the historical context.
