          <p>At least three people died in North Dakota after severe weather, including a derecho with wind gusts up to 106 mph and nine reported tornadoes, swept across the region. The Cass County Sheriff's Office responded to a report of tornado damage in rural Enderlin, where storm chasers had already located two deceased individuals. A third deceased person was found shortly after at another location. Law enforcement and first responders are continuing to search the area and conduct well-being checks on residents. The storm also brought heavy rain, causing spotty flash flooding and prompting multiple water rescues in Fargo.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ordered his release from ICE detention in Louisiana. Khalil, who had been detained for months, addressed reporters, stating his intention to continue advocating for Palestinian rights. The Trump administration had sought his deportation for his role in Columbia campus protests against Israel, claiming his activities aligned with Hamas, though he was not charged with any crimes. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was neither a threat nor a flight risk, criticizing the government's actions as an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, leading to Khalil's release and return to New York. The article highlights similar cases of other activists detained for their speech and later released by federal judges.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, reaching 33.2C near Gatwick, as a Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms went into effect. The storms are expected to bring localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning to parts of northern England, the Scottish Borders, and north-east Wales. An amber heat-health alert remains in place for England, with research suggesting nearly 600 heat-related deaths could occur in the next four days. Firefighters have responded to a significant increase in wildfires, and the public is urged to take heat and water safety seriously. The article also notes that climate change is making heatwaves hotter and longer, increasing the chance of reaching high temperatures.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release pending immigration proceedings. Khalil, detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns, addressed reporters after his release, criticizing the Trump administration's actions. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil posed no threat to the community and was not a flight risk, calling his detention "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested in March, and his wife gave birth to their first child while he was in custody; immigration officials had denied his request for temporary release to attend the birth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steve Bannon, holding no official government position, reportedly influenced President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential strike against an Iranian nuclear facility. Bannon advised Trump that Israeli intelligence couldn't be trusted and that the "bunker-buster" bomb might not work as planned. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, advocated for supporting Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly ceded the discussion to military commanders, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio, initially hawkish on Iran, has aligned more with a noninterventionist stance, adding to the complexity of the decision-making process.</p>

          <p>The United States is reportedly moving B-2 bombers to Guam as President Trump considers potential involvement in Israel's strikes against Iran. The B-2 bomber can carry the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, designed to destroy deeply buried targets, including Iran's nuclear program. It is unclear if the bomber deployment is directly tied to Middle East tensions, but experts are watching to see if the bombers will move to Diego Garcia, which is in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East. Israel stated it killed a veteran Iranian commander during recent attacks, while Iran said it would not negotiate over its nuclear program under threat.</p>

          <p>A second body was recovered in Banff National Park after a rockslide struck hikers on a trail near Lake Louise. The incident resulted in two fatalities and three serious injuries, with an estimated 100 personnel responding. One of the victims was identified as retired educator Jutta Hinrichs. A trail guide described seeing signs of rocks tumbling and boulders falling before the major rockslide occurred. The park remains open, but the area around Bow Glacier Falls is closed until further notice, and officials are urging visitors to be aware of mountain risks.</p>

          <p>At least eight people died in a hot air balloon accident in Brazil, with 13 survivors taken to nearby hospitals. The incident occurred in Praia Grande, and authorities are investigating the cause. According to the pilot, a fire started inside the basket, prompting him to lower the balloon and instruct passengers to jump. Some passengers were unable to jump, and the balloon began to rise again before falling due to a loss of suspension. Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva expressed solidarity with the victims' families.</p>

The discovery was made after researchers received a blood sample from the patient undergoing routine tests before surgery. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, and the discovery has been officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to "high-throughput DNA sequencing," which highlighted a genetic mutation. The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene.</p>

          <p>The longer Israel's attack on Iran goes on, the greater the speculation about the possibility of overthrowing the government in Tehran. However, regime change has historically had disastrous consequences in the region. Foreign-imposed "regime change" is a highly controversial concept that is a clear violation of the sovereignty of the affected state. Examples in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya illustrate the potential for violence and instability. Experts suggest that ground forces would be required to force a change of government in Iran, and there is no massively strong rebel movement within Iran that could topple the current regime.</p>
