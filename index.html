            <p>A CBS News poll reveals mixed views on President Trump's tariff policies, with most Americans anticipating higher prices. While Republicans generally support Trump's goals and believe tariffs will create jobs in the long term, a majority of Americans think the tariffs will negatively impact the economy and their personal finances. The public is split on whether Trump has a clear plan, but most believe the tariffs are a negotiating tactic. The poll also indicates declining approval ratings for Trump's handling of the economy and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) is highlighted as an example of this strategy. Ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs are also mentioned as a popular alternative, though the bond ladder strategy can serve a broader goal of protecting buying power and providing peace of mind.

            <p>Pete Marocco, a Trump administration official who played a significant role in dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has left the State Department. The Trump administration has moved to fire USAID staff and cut funding, citing wasteful spending. Marocco, as Director of Foreign Assistance, conducted a review of foreign aid spending. The administration is reinstating some previously canceled US foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance.</p>

            <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to begin in Washington. The FTC alleges that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition, creating a monopoly. If the FTC wins, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be forced to sell off both platforms. The case has become politicized, with Zuckerberg reportedly lobbying Trump to drop the case and Trump firing two FTC commissioners. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering imposing new tariffs on semiconductors, reversing course after recently lifting reciprocal tariffs on certain electronics. The administration argues that semiconductors are critical to national security and that the U.S. needs to onshore their production. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the electronics tariff exemptions are temporary and will be replaced by the semiconductor tariff. The move could impact a wide range of industries that rely on semiconductors.</p>
