          <p>Hefin David, a Welsh Labour politician and Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly since 2016, has died suddenly at the age of 47. Tributes have been paid by political leaders, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan, who remembered him as a dedicated public servant and an outstanding, passionate politician. Gwent Police confirmed they found a 47-year-old man unresponsive at a property, and the death is not being treated as suspicious. David was known for his lively contributions to debates and was a popular figure across the political spectrum, deeply committed to his community.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed and is projected to become the season's first hurricane by late this week. Currently moving west across the Atlantic, early models indicate it could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, where at least eight fatalities were reported, prompting a state of emergency.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chairman when his term ends. Among the names are Jefferies' David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, joining previously mentioned figures like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. According to sources, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead a deliberative interview process to create a shortlist for the president. This extensive process suggests a decision is not imminent, providing some stability by avoiding a disruptive 'shadow Fed chair' scenario. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the fast-casual restaurant chain Cava fell over 20% after the company revised its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth downward. The new projection is 4% to 6%, reduced from the previous range of 6% to 8%. This adjustment came after second-quarter same-store sales grew by only 2.1%, significantly missing Wall Street's expectation of 6.1% growth, as traffic was reportedly flat. The slowdown followed the one-year anniversary of the company's popular grilled steak launch, which had previously driven strong sales and traffic to its locations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emerging research suggests that microplastics accumulating in soil and water can be absorbed by plants, potentially disrupting photosynthesis and impeding growth. A recent study indicated that this interference could reduce photosynthesis by up to 12%, leading to significant declines in staple crop and seafood yields, which could impact global food security. While experts caution that more data is needed for global projections, the findings highlight a serious concern. The primary sources of these plastics in agriculture include mulch films and sewage sludge used as fertilizer, underscoring the need for better regulation of plastic production and pollution.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp stated that he was pelted with bottles and threatened with a knife while visiting a migrant camp in northern France. Philp was there to investigate the ongoing migrant crisis and the effectiveness of the UK's policies. The incident highlights the tense situation at these camps as the number of people attempting to cross the English Channel continues to be a major political issue. The Labour government has implemented a 'one-in, one-out' returns deal with France, which the Conservatives have criticized for being ineffective compared to their proposed Rwanda plan.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for California are arguing in court that President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles was an illegal violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The state contends that the military presence caused public anxiety and was an unconstitutional use of armed forces for domestic law enforcement, including detaining civilians. In contrast, the Justice Department asserts the deployment was legal under Title 10, claiming it was necessary to protect federal property and personnel during protests described by the administration as a 'rebellion'. The trial's outcome could set a precedent for future federal military deployments in U.S. cities.</p>

The conflict has allowed the military to operate with minimal civilian oversight, further destabilizing a fragile coalition government. A leaked phone call in which Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra appeared to criticize her own army has intensified the political crisis, leading to her suspension.

Despite the strong performance and expansion of business with key clients like OpenAI, investors reacted negatively. The company's operating margin shrank significantly due to stock-based compensation costs, and its debt has grown to $11.1 billion, which may have contributed to the market's cautious response.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing surged by 23% last week, marking the strongest week for such applications since last April. This jump was driven by a slight decrease in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which fell to 6.67%. The increase in activity also saw a rise in demand for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), as their rates became more attractive compared to fixed-rate loans. While homeowners are actively seeking to lower their monthly payments, applications for home purchases saw only a marginal 1% increase, suggesting that high home prices continue to be a significant barrier for potential buyers.

          <p>The ongoing excavation of a mass grave in Chemmani, northern Sri Lanka, has unearthed 140 skeletons and reopened deep wounds from the country's civil war.

Families of the disappeared, who have been searching for loved ones for over a decade, see the graves as a painful reminder of past atrocities.

          <p>Latino cultural festivals in several small towns across the U.S., from Virginia to Indiana, are being canceled this summer due to widespread fear of immigration raids. Organizers cite a "climate of fear" stemming from increased U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity under the Trump administration, which has disrupted daily life for many in the Latino community. These cancellations have significant social and economic consequences, hurting local immigrant-owned businesses and depriving towns of revenue from permits and sponsorships. The trend highlights the tangible impact of sweeping deportation policies on community life and local economies.</p>

The White House confirmed that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will be permitted to sell advanced chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of their revenue there. Meanwhile, Apple announced a substantial increase in its U.S. investment commitment, a move seen as a successful bid to avoid tariffs on its products. Analysts suggest this flurry of deal-making reflects the significant financial pressure tariffs are placing on Big Tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China has built the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing. They developed an AI-powered system to arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which serve as qubits, into perfect patterns with unprecedented speed. This achievement overcomes a major obstacle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a highly promising approach due to the stability and control of neutral atoms. The milestone, hailed by reviewers as a significant leap forward, could accelerate the development of powerful and practical quantum computers by enabling much larger and more complex systems.</p>

Approximately 800 troops and 500 federal agents are expected, a move D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has condemned as an "authoritarian push." The mayor and police chief dispute the administration's claims, pointing to official data showing that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year low and continues to fall. The deployment has heightened political tensions, with critics viewing it as an unnecessary federal overreach into local affairs.</p>

The National Weather Service predicts the river will crest at a new record high, surpassing previous floods that have destroyed homes and damaged hundreds of residences in recent years. This annual event, exacerbated by a warming climate, poses an imminent threat of catastrophic flooding, prompting a state disaster declaration.</p>
