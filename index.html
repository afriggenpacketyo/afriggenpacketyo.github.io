          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner, a prominent figure in the Labour Party, proposed tax increases amounting to Â£3-4 billion annually, which were not implemented by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves. This revelation highlights ongoing debates within the party regarding fiscal policy, particularly as departmental spending plans are set to be outlined in June. The memo suggested measures such as increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. The Conservatives have seized on this leak to accuse Labour of planning future tax hikes, while Labour maintains its commitment to fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to developing a universal antivenom. Over decades, Friede has gradually built up immunity to various snake venoms, prompting researchers to study his blood for potential medical applications. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers aim to synthesize a treatment from Friede's antibodies that could neutralize toxins from multiple snake species, offering a more effective and accessible solution for envenomation.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first US-born pope, has been met with skepticism from some Maga Catholics, who view him as a continuation of Pope Francis's progressive policies. This article discusses the potential clash between the new pope and Trumpian nationalism, especially concerning issues like migration and economic inequality. The author highlights the historical context, drawing parallels with Leo XIII's efforts to address the challenges of the Industrial Revolution. The article suggests that Leo XIV's focus on global cooperation and compassion for migrants may challenge the insular worldview of Maga Catholics.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never purchased rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark perceived as insensitive amidst a national rice shortage and soaring prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address the crisis. The comment drew attention to the government's inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has been blamed on decades-old policies and has affected Ishiba's approval ratings.

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Calls US Export Curbs on AI Chips to China a Failure</h2>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has criticized the United States' export controls on artificial intelligence chips to China, deeming them a "failure" as Chinese companies turn to locally-developed technology. Huang stated that companies would use the "second best" option if they couldn't obtain chips from Nvidia, leading to a decline in Nvidia's market share in China. US export controls have spurred Chinese companies to invest in and develop their own semiconductor supply chain. Huang praised Trump's understanding that US companies are not the only providers of AI technology.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, incorrectly defined habeas corpus during a Senate hearing, asserting it was the president's right to deport people. This misunderstanding came as the Trump administration considers suspending habeas corpus for immigrants being expelled from the country. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem, emphasizing that habeas corpus is a legal principle protecting against unlawful detention. Noem's answer echoed the Trump administration's expansive view of presidential power, but legal experts maintain that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus.</p>

The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, potentially leading to Â£1m payouts on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street stated that rewarding themselves for failure is unacceptable, and the regulator Ofwat may introduce new rules to prevent water firms from handing out bonuses.

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing backlash for commenting that he "never had to buy rice" because he received it as gifts, a statement seen as insensitive given the high rice prices. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record-high prices of the country's traditional staple food, causing political trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government. Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's successor to address the situation. The government has released tons of rice from its emergency stockpile, but it has not significantly improved the situation.</p>
