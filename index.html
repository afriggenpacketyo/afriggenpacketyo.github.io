        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New projections indicate that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 may be the lowest in five years, potentially at 2.4%. This adjustment, which provides an annual inflation boost to Social Security beneficiaries, including retirees and disabled individuals, is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, which is used to calculate Social Security's COLA, has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months. The actual COLA could change depending on inflation trends in the coming months, but if enacted, it would be the smallest increase since 2021.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced sanctions against nearly two dozen firms involved in Iran's illicit international oil trade. This action coincided with President Trump's speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he offered Iran a "much brighter future" if it agrees to a new nuclear deal with the United States. The sanctioned firms are accused of helping Iran's Armed Forces and Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars Company, its commercial affiliate, circumvent restrictions to fund ballistic missile development and support regional terrorist groups. Trump warned of "massive maximum pressure" if Iran rejects the offer, reiterating his stance that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria marks a seismic shift in Middle East policy, posing political risks and raising questions about the new Syrian government's ability to maintain stability and protect minorities. Concerns persist regarding the new government's capacity to contain the Islamic State, promote democratic values, and safeguard minority rights. Trump's planned meeting with Syrian leader Ahmad al Sharaa signifies a major change, as it will be the first in-person meeting between leaders of the two countries since 2000.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he is placing a hold on Department of Justice political nominations to protest President Trump's plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. Schumer criticized the move as corrupt and a national security threat, demanding answers from the Trump administration and Justice Department. Schumer called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress to explain why gifting Donald Trump a private jet does not violate the emoluments clause. While Republicans hold the majority, Schumer's move could slow down the confirmation process.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez returned to court for a resentencing hearing to determine if they should have a chance at freedom after serving nearly three decades for the murder of their parents in 1989. The hearing centers on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated and deserve a lesser sentence, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. Prosecutors are opposed to resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't taken full responsibility. The current district attorney reversed course from his predecessor, who had recommended resentencing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are facing a legal challenge from small businesses who argue that they are an unlawful expansion of executive power. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give Trump the right to unilaterally impose tariffs. The Department of Justice has defended the tariffs, stating that Congress permits the president to impose some tariffs, and Trump's invoking of a national emergency makes his power broader. At least six lawsuits have targeted Trump's use of tariffs, including a case filed by the state of California.</p>

The network allegedly facilitated the shipment of billions of dollars worth of oil on behalf of Iran’s Armed Forces General Staff and its front company, Sepehr Energy. The sale of the oil helped fund the development of Iranian ballistic missiles and drones, nuclear proliferation, and attacks by the Houthi militant group, according to the US State Department.
