          <p>According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a major budget bill supported by President Trump could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing health insurance coverage. The CBO's analysis also projects the legislation would add almost $3.3 trillion to the national debt, complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill. The proposal includes significant cuts to Medicaid, a federal healthcare program for low-income individuals, which has become a central point of contention for both Democratic and some Republican lawmakers. The bill's passage remains uncertain as it faces debate in the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a marathon debate over President Trump's major tax and spending package after narrowly voting to advance the legislation. Democrats are utilizing procedural rules to delay a final vote, forcing a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill. The legislation, which includes increased spending on border security and defense offset by cuts to healthcare, is being pursued through the budget reconciliation process, requiring only a simple majority. With a slim Republican majority, the bill's final passage remains uncertain as leaders work to secure support from party holdouts concerned about its fiscal impact.</p>

          <p>Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, stated that his country's nuclear enrichment activities will never cease, describing it as an inalienable right for peaceful purposes under international treaties. His comments follow U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which he said have created an improper condition for new negotiations. While denying threats against IAEA inspectors, Iravani confirmed their access to nuclear sites is suspended. The statement comes amid conflicting assessments of the damage from U.S. strikes, with President Trump claiming obliteration while others suggest Iran could resume production within months.</p>

          <p>The health impact of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, remains a topic of public and scientific debate. Figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. have claimed these oils are harmful to Americans' health. However, many nutrition researchers and scientists contend that the available evidence does not support these strong claims of toxicity. The discussion centers on the processing methods and chemical composition of these oils, particularly their levels of omega-6 fatty acids. The scientific consensus has generally supported their use in moderation as part of a balanced diet.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities cautions against premature conclusions about their effectiveness. The article argues that a comprehensive battle damage assessment (BDA) is a complex process that integrates various intelligence sources over time, making initial reports unreliable. It highlights the advancements in precision-guided munitions and bunker-busting bombs, suggesting the physical damage was likely severe. However, the true impact also includes functional and indirect effects on Iran's entire nuclear ecosystem, which are harder to measure immediately but crucial for a complete understanding of the setback.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a potential ban in the United States over national security concerns. In a television interview, Trump stated that a group of "very wealthy people" is prepared to acquire the platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes as the president has repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a law passed by Congress that mandates the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

Such collapses are common in Sudan's artisanal mining sector, which suffers from poor safety standards.
