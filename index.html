          <p>A US woman, Aimee Betro, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder and firearm offenses in the UK, concluding a nearly five-year international manhunt. She was hired as a killer in 2019 as part of a vendetta against a Birmingham businessman, but her attempt to shoot his son at point-blank range failed when her gun jammed, allowing the target to escape unharmed. Betro, who used a niqab for disguise, went on the run to Armenia before being tracked down and extradited. Her co-conspirators, Mohammed Nazir and Mohammed Aslam, were jailed last year for their involvement in the plot, which stemmed from a prior dispute. Betro is scheduled for sentencing on August 21st.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have strongly reiterated their position that Ukraine's borders must not be altered by force, highlighting the deep nervousness across Europe regarding Moscow's actions. Their statement underscores the significant implications of Russia's aggression for both European and international security, calling for a just and lasting peace. The EU pledged continued military support for Kyiv's inherent right of self-defense and its aspirations for EU membership. This unified stance comes ahead of a highly anticipated meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where discussions about potential territorial swaps for peace are expected to take place, though Hungary notably opted out of the EU's declaration.</p>

          <p>A day at a New Jersey beach tragically turned deadly as one person succumbed to a rip current, while six others were successfully rescued in a dramatic jet-ski operation. The incident occurred on Monday evening at Webster Avenue Beach in Seaside Heights, a location that did not have lifeguards on duty at the time. The Seaside Heights Fire Department swiftly deployed a rescue swimmer with a jet ski, bringing the victims to shore, though CPR efforts for the seventh individual were ultimately unsuccessful. This event highlights the severe dangers of rip currents, which have accounted for 49 deaths this year, prompting experts to advise individuals caught in them to relax, float, and swim parallel to the shore.</p>

          <p>HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK has officially confirmed its use of artificial intelligence to monitor social media posts as part of criminal investigations targeting suspected tax cheats. The agency emphasized that this technology will not replace human decision-making and is subject to legal oversight, aiming to improve efficiency by allowing staff to focus less on administration and more on assisting taxpayers and combating fraud. While experts acknowledge AI's potential for streamlining processes, they also caution about inherent risks, such as cases of mistaken identity arising from fake or hacked social media accounts. HMRC's broader focus with AI also includes developing tools to help taxpayers file returns correctly and access extensive online guidance.</p>

          <p>Lior Ron, the founder and CEO of Uber Freight, is transitioning to self-driving truck startup Waabi as chief operating officer, driven by his conviction that the era of autonomous big rigs operating at scale on U.S. roads is now here. Waabi anticipates deploying fully driverless trucks on commercial freight routes across the U.S. Southwest by the end of the year, with an ambitious goal to cover all of North America within the next five years. Ron, who will remain chairman of Uber Freight, views autonomous freight as the most fundamental shift of the next decade, promising to more than double daily cargo movement capabilities and offer enhanced safety and fuel efficiency compared to traditional trucking, while also addressing the longstanding driver shortage.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty experienced a 30% decline in net income in its first fiscal quarter following President Donald Trump's tariffs, yet CEO Tarang Amin expresses strong confidence, highlighting the company's impressive 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth and ongoing international expansion. A key strategic move is the recent $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, which will introduce E.l.f. into Sephora stores this fall. Despite financing this substantial deal with $600 million of debt, financial experts are cautiously optimistic about Rhode's rapid growth and its potential to be highly accretive for E.l.f. The company continues to challenge legacy beauty players, having celebrated its first billion-dollar fiscal year in May 2024 and maintaining its position as a top brand among younger consumers.</p>

          <p>US inflation remained steady at 2.7% in July compared to a year earlier, with price declines in essential goods like groceries and gasoline helping to offset increases in other consumer categories. However, economists are raising concerns about underlying trends, particularly the growing influence of Trump administration policies, such as tariffs and immigration restrictions, which are beginning to stoke inflation for certain goods and services. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 3.1% annually, marking its fastest rate since February. Businesses are expected to continue passing on these higher tariff-related costs to consumers, potentially increasing household expenses by an estimated $2,400 annually, with the full impact likely to be felt in the coming months.

          <p>President Trump has controversially imposed a military takeover of Washington D.C., deploying National Guard troops and seizing control of the municipal police department by invoking an obscure section of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act. Critics argue that this action, taken without a clear emergency, represents a stark demonstration of authoritarian power and further erodes the long-standing American taboo against deploying military personnel for domestic law enforcement. This move follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and suggests a broader intention to extend federal authority into cities perceived as defiant. The article asserts that the thin pretext for these actions serves primarily as a symbolic display of force, aiming to impose the president's will on local jurisdictions.</p>

The decision by the second- and third-generation owners to sell reflects a broader trend of diminishing Basque immigration to the U.S. and a generational divide, leading to the closure of many once-thriving Basque businesses in Southern California.

Trump's latest attack centers on Powell's management of significant renovations at the Fed's Washington D.C. headquarters, which the President claims cost $3 billion for a job that should have been a $50 million fix-up, branding Powell as a "loser" and "Too Late." This threat follows months of Trump's public demands for the Fed to rapidly slash interest rates, which he believes would save the U.S. vast sums of money.

Both savings vehicles offer variable, typically higher interest rates than standard savings accounts, providing a safe place to park funds. The key distinction lies in accessibility: money market accounts often come with debit cards and checks, potentially requiring higher minimum balances or tiered APYs, while high-yield savings accounts generally have lower barriers to entry. Financial advisors recommend money market accounts for those needing occasional access to a large nest egg, while high-yield savings are ideal for building emergency funds or saving for short-term goals.

One option is to reinvest RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) often recommended over mutual funds for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. For charitable investors, a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) directly from an IRA to a non-profit can satisfy RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be strategically used to contribute to 529 college savings plans for family members, potentially securing state tax breaks while planning for future generations.

This relentless bombardment occurs as Israeli forces prepare to occupy the city, a move condemned by the UN Security Council. Simultaneously, the UK, EU, Australia, Canada, and Japan have issued a joint statement warning that "famine is unfolding before our eyes" in Gaza, urging immediate and concrete steps to facilitate aid entry and accusing Israel of hindering distribution. The World Health Organization has also appealed for urgent medical supplies, while an international group of former leaders has for the first time labeled the situation an "unfolding genocide," blaming Israel for causing the famine.</p>

Seles chose to share her personal journey ahead of the U.S. Open to raise crucial awareness about MG, which affects approximately 60,000 people in the United States. She described experiencing debilitating symptoms such as double vision and weakness in her arms and legs, highlighting the profound impact the condition has had on her daily life. While there is currently no cure for myasthenia gravis, the article notes that various treatments are available to help manage symptoms, and in some cases, muscle weakness may even disappear completely.</p>

          <p>Nicola Sturgeon's new memoir, "Frankly," offers candid insights into her tenure as Scotland's former first minister, revealing the profound personal and political challenges that impacted her mental health. She expresses regret over the process of legislating for gender self-identification, admitting she wished she had paused to build consensus, and directly addresses the controversy surrounding a double rapist initially sent to a female prison. The article details her fractured relationship with former mentor Alex Salmond, her reflections on the 2014 independence referendum, and the immense emotional toll of leading Scotland through the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought her "perilously close to a breakdown." Sturgeon also recounts experiences with pervasive misogyny and sexism throughout her career, alongside deeply personal revelations about a miscarriage and the end of her marriage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent public emphasis on protecting eagles from wind energy projects, articulated by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, is being widely interpreted as a calculated pretext to hinder the expansion of US wind farms, which President Trump has consistently opposed. While wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, this article highlights that significantly greater dangers to avian populations come from sources like stray cats, buildings, and climate change, the latter of which wind energy aims to combat. Critics argue that the administration's selective concern for eagles starkly contradicts its broader policies of loosening environmental protections for the oil and gas industry and other endangered species, suggesting a political agenda rather than genuine conservation efforts.</p>

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed this success to increasing institutional interest in the wake of their IPO and the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a supportive U.S. crypto law signed by Trump. The company also announced the upcoming launch of Arc, a new blockchain specifically designed for stablecoin payments, foreign exchange, and capital markets applications, signaling ambitious future expansion in the digital finance sector.

          <p>During the ongoing trial of California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration, a key general involved in the controversial Los Angeles National Guard deployment testified that he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." This testimony directly challenges the Trump administration's justification for the deployment, which invoked a federal law allowing presidential call-ups during a "rebellion" or "invasion." Military officials clarified that their mission was primarily to protect federal facilities and support federal law enforcement, even in the absence of active threats. The general's statements highlight the legal complexities and potential overreach associated with the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement, particularly when the stated rationale for such actions is disputed.</p>

Pinkerton, who has since worked as a traveling evangelist across multiple states and internationally, was extradited from Georgia to Maryland to face 24 felony and misdemeanor counts, to which he has pleaded not guilty.

This impending delisting marks the end of Evergrande's 16-year trading status in Hong Kong, an era that once symbolized the peak of China's property boom. The company's default on its offshore bonds in late 2021 had already triggered widespread global concerns about potential financial contagion from China's struggling housing market.

While Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian welcomed the peace, an advisor to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed to block the corridor, expressing concerns about growing US influence in the region and a potential blow to Iran's energy interests. The new route offers Azerbaijan a more direct trade connection to Turkey and Europe, strategically diminishing Russia's traditional dominance in the South Caucasus.

          <p>A new law enacted by the Trump administration is projected to significantly reduce access to food stamp benefits for 2.4 million Americans, including families with children, by expanding work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that this policy will shift costs onto states and disproportionately impact households at the lower end of the income distribution, while benefiting higher earners. The bill now mandates that parents of children aged 14 and older, along with adults aged 55-64, veterans, and homeless individuals, must work, volunteer, or participate in job training for at least 80 hours monthly to receive benefits. Critics argue these changes will exacerbate hunger and food insecurity, advocating for increased SNAP benefits and expanded access to affordable food instead.</p>
