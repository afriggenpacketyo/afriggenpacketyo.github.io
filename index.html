        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 17,000 people are being evacuated in Manitoba, Canada, due to widespread wildfires, leading to a province-wide state of emergency. Premier Wab Kinew has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in both evacuation and firefighting efforts. The evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, and residents from several other remote towns and Indigenous communities are also being moved to safety, with most evacuees heading to Winnipeg. This marks the largest evacuation in Manitoba's recent history, following a severe wildfire season in 2023 and earlier incidents in May where two people died in Lac du Bonnet.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is considering "aggressively" revoking visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in "critical fields". The State Department is revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong, raising concerns across U.S. university campuses. This move coincides with heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology, potentially impacting the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the U.S. and the universities that rely on their contributions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade has blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Trump on numerous countries to correct trade imbalances. The ruling deals a blow to Trump's economic agenda and ongoing trade deal negotiations. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to levy universal duties on imports. The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court could ultimately decide the case; several existing tariffs are not impacted by this ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government is considering sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This potential move reflects Britain's hardening stance toward Israel's conduct in the war, although the recent attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington has caused some officials to pause and reconsider the timing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government faces mounting pressure to act, both from within his Labour Party and from human rights lawyers, as the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate despite international condemnation.</p>

          <p>Racial segregation in schools continues in Slovakia, where over 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are the majority. Roma children are often separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes" with lower academic expectations and higher drop-out rates. Despite legal guarantees and reforms, segregation persists, sometimes rebranded under the guise of minority rights. Activists argue that these measures reinforce segregation rather than ending it, emphasizing the need for diverse classrooms and early support to ensure equality.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced his departure from the Trump administration after criticizing the president's tax bill, citing his scheduled time as a Special Government Employee coming to an end. Musk's role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) focused on reducing wasteful spending. His departure follows criticism of Trump's spending plan, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's efforts. Musk had pledged to cut trillions from the federal budget but faced resistance and labeled DOGE a "whipping boy."</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies as "fantasy" economics, likening Farage to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Reform's policies would lead to increased mortgage costs, accusing Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts. A Reform spokesperson dismissed the comments as a "desperate attack" from a party "behind in the polls." The Institute for Fiscal Studies questioned whether Reform's sums added up, particularly regarding a commitment to raising the income tax threshold.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court cited the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal against the decision, arguing it's not for unelected judges to decide how to address a national emergency. (not investment advice)</p>
