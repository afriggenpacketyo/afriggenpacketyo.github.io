          <p>Caught between the US-China trade war, Asean has the chance to assert itself as a linchpin in global trade and geopolitics by fostering a neutral, inclusive trade ecosystem. China and Asean recently finalized negotiations to upgrade their free-trade agreement, aiming to deepen economic integration through digital trade and green economy initiatives, with bilateral trade exceeding $980 billion last year. Simultaneously, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks a unified response to US tariffs to ensure trade fairness for Asean's export-driven economies. Asean's geographical centrality and diplomatic neutrality positions it to shape trade rules and prioritize regional resilience, requiring unprecedented cohesion amidst internal divisions and external pressures. The article argues that Asean can redefine its role by leveraging the US-China rivalry to become the architect of a new regional order.</p>

          <p>A passenger train traveling from Klimov to Moscow derailed in Russia's Bryansk region, near the Ukrainian border, after a bridge collapsed due to an explosion, resulting in seven deaths and over 60 injuries. Russian investigators later reported a second bridge collapse in the Kursk region, also bordering Ukraine, which was the site of a Ukrainian incursion last August. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, border regions like Bryansk have experienced shelling, drone strikes, and covert raids. Russian authorities initially attributed the Bryansk collapse to "illegal interference in transport operations" before confirming an explosion.</p>

          <p>A history buff using a metal detector led archaeologists to the site of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden, after spotting a strange symbol on an 18th-century map. The location, marked as "Klosterkullen" (monastery hill) on a 1760 map, was investigated using ground-penetrating radar, revealing the walls of probable monastery ruins. Archaeologists believe the walls are remains of pillar foundations dating back to the late 1100s, potentially the original site of Ã…s Abbey, a large monastery managed by the Cistercian religious order.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe experience greater meaning in life compared to those without children, but they also report lower levels of life satisfaction, especially mothers. The degree of life satisfaction is strongly influenced by the family policies in place in their respective countries. Scandinavian countries, with robust childcare and parental support systems, show smaller differences in satisfaction between parents and childfree individuals. The study suggests that societies that view children as a shared responsibility, rather than solely the parents', contribute to higher parental satisfaction.</p>

          <p>China is facing public backlash over the reinstatement and promotion of officials disciplined for misconduct, despite efforts by Beijing to incentivize officials amid an economic downturn and anti-corruption campaigns. The case of Xie Qin, a township party chief up for promotion after a drinking spree, has sparked debate, with many expressing frustration at officials being "rewarded" for their actions. This practice is part of a broader effort to motivate officials who are "lying flat," doing the bare minimum, but it is proving unpopular among the public.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant increase in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe, with experts attributing the trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation has reduced citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of processed foods with low nutritional value. The Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, but it has faced criticism for stigmatizing overweight individuals and overlooking broader economic struggles. Experts advocate for stricter regulations on unhealthy foods and a nationwide free school meal program.</p>

          <p>The Football Association's ban on transgender women playing in women's football has come into effect, preventing 28 registered transgender women from participating in FA-affiliated leagues. This follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' based on biological sex. The ban has forced Billie Sky to stop playing for London Galaxy, though she can still play informally for Goal Diggers FC, which withdrew from FA-affiliated leagues in response. Supporters of the ban believe it protects the integrity of women's football, while others raise concerns about inclusion and safety.</p>
