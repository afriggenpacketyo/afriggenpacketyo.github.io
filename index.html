          <p>A significant wildfire is currently burning in the Corbieres hills of southern France, prompting the evacuation of villages and campgrounds. The blaze has forced the closure of sections of the A9 motorway, a key route connecting France and Spain, causing major travel disruptions. Over 1,250 firefighters, supported by water-bombing aircraft, are battling the fire, which has already burned thousands of hectares. Two people have been injured, one critically, as officials describe the situation as challenging due to strong winds and extremely dry conditions in the region.</p>

The man was found in a secure parking area of the airport, which is often used by former President Trump, though he was not in Florida at the time. The suspect was taken into custody without incident, and law enforcement officials are currently investigating the motive.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced it will not pursue the death penalty against two infamous Mexican drug lords, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is a co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa cartel. Both men have pleaded not guilty to numerous drug trafficking charges. This decision, directed by the Attorney General, removes capital punishment as a possibility but does not yet indicate whether plea deals are being negotiated in these high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss critical issues affecting her state, including the negative impact of tariffs on the auto industry. During the meeting, she also advocated for a three-year delay in proposed changes to the state's Medicaid program to avoid disrupting care for vulnerable residents. Whitmer has maintained a working relationship with the White House, arguing that bipartisanship is essential for securing federal investments and support for Michigan.

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, as explained in this article. Modern meteorology can predict weather one day out with over 90% accuracy, yet challenges persist due to the "chaotic" nature of the atmosphere, where small initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. The difficulty of condensing vast amounts of complex data for television or app-based forecasts also contributes to perceived inaccuracies. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which promises greater accuracy but also presents new challenges in communicating uncertainty and handling unprecedented climate events.</p>

          <p>While divisions over Israel have long been a feature of the Democratic party, this article suggests that similar fissures are now emerging among Republicans. The traditional, unwavering pro-Israel stance within the GOP is facing challenges from factions within the MAGA movement. This shift reflects a broader realignment in American foreign policy perspectives, where nationalist and "America First" sentiments are beginning to influence long-held party orthodoxies. The article points to a growing disenchantment that could have significant implications for the future of U.S.-Israel relations and bipartisan consensus on the issue.</p>

          <p>Escalating trade disputes between the U.S. and India are casting doubt on a planned visit by President Donald Trump and the future of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). The White House has been pushing for significant "deliverables," including a trade deal, before committing to the presidential trip. However, recent threats from Trump to increase tariffs and criticism of India's oil purchases from Russia have soured relations. This growing rift not only jeopardizes bilateral ties but also weakens the strategic alliance, which includes Japan and Australia, aimed at countering China's regional influence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a significant increase in annual renewal fees for legal marijuana businesses, a move officials say is necessary to cover the operational costs of the city's cannabis department. The fee hikes come as the local cannabis industry is already struggling with declining tax revenues, high operational costs, and intense competition from the illicit market. While the city argues the increases are essential to avoid straining its general fund, some struggling business owners warn that the additional financial pressure could force them to shut down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Snap Inc. fell over 15% after the company reported disappointing second-quarter financial results, particularly a key metric for average revenue per user (ARPU) that missed Wall Street expectations. The company cited a bungled advertising platform update and the timing of Ramadan as factors affecting its topline growth. Although daily active users slightly exceeded projections, the weaker-than-expected ARPU signaled trouble in monetizing its user base effectively. The company's third-quarter revenue forecast, however, was slightly ahead of analyst estimates, offering a mixed outlook for the social media firm. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed rules would establish a clear framework for companies to operate drones beyond the pilot's line of sight for tasks like deliveries and inspections. Previously, such operations required a complicated, case-by-case waiver process that officials say has stifled innovation. The new regulations would require drones to meet specific safety standards, including having collision avoidance technology, to ensure they can be safely integrated into the national airspace.</p>

His attorneys argued that the device could have activated during the lethal injection process, potentially causing unnecessary pain and prolonging his death, but the state's Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to deactivate it. Black, who had multiple serious health conditions, was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.
