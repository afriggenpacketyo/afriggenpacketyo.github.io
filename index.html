The council's initial injunction to remove 138 asylum seekers from The Bell Hotel was overturned by the Court of Appeal. The legal battle centers on claims that the hotel owner breached planning regulations, while the appellate court cited risks of encouraging "further lawlessness" if the injunction were upheld.</p>

          <p>Landslides are a common and deadly geological event, affecting millions globally and often triggered by factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity. Recent events in Sudan and Papua New Guinea highlight their devastating impact, particularly in areas with inadequate infrastructure. Experts classify landslides into four main types—falls, topples, slides, and flows—and suggest that prevention is possible through improved drainage, structural reinforcements, and avoiding construction on steep, unstable slopes.</p>

          <p>A rebel group controlling the Marrah Mountains area in Sudan's Darfur region has reported that a massive landslide has killed an estimated 1,000 people. The disaster, which occurred on Sunday after days of heavy rain, is said to have completely destroyed the village of Tarasin, with only one person surviving. The group has appealed for international aid to help recover bodies, but access to the region is severely restricted due to the ongoing civil war that has engulfed the country.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision reflects the club's long-term "Project 150" strategy, which aims to build a title-contending team by the club's 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League talent, the club's data analysis favored Lammens for his high ratings in key metrics and his potential to be in his prime by 2028.</p>

The government is attempting to contrast its measured, policy-driven approach with the rhetoric of Reform UK, which gained prominence over the summer, particularly on the issue of asylum. This sets up a key political battle over whether voters will remain patient with the government's strategy or embrace an insurgent alternative.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that India offered to cut its tariffs "to nothing" in response to steep new U.S. duties, which he described as a response to a "one-sided disaster" of a trade relationship. The 50% U.S. tariffs were imposed partly due to India's continued purchase of Russian oil, a policy that has strained relations with Washington. The comments came as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with the leaders of Russia and China at the SCO summit.</p>

Tesla launched its Model Y in the country at a high price point of around $70,000, reflecting steep import tariffs, which has likely impacted demand in the price-sensitive market.</p>
