        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, has issued a non-binding but influential advisory opinion stating that countries can sue each other over the impacts of climate change. This ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly Pacific islands, who initiated the case due to frustration with the lack of global action. The court affirmed that countries have legal obligations under international law to protect the environment and the climate system, even beyond existing agreements like the Paris Accord. This decision could pave the way for future compensation claims against historically high-emitting nations.</p>

          <p>Retail traders, coordinating on platforms like Reddit's WallStreetBets, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing their stock prices to surge significantly. This speculative activity focuses on heavily shorted and relatively inexpensive stocks, echoing the GameStop mania of 2021. Krispy Kreme has 28% of its float shares sold short, making it a prime target for a "short squeeze." This new wave of meme stock trading occurs as the broader market reaches record highs, fueled by optimism over economic data and tariff news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new law designed to accelerate the procurement of weapons and military equipment for the Bundeswehr by reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called the move a "quantum leap" for national security, citing Russia as the most immediate threat. The legislation will raise value limits for direct contracts, bypassing lengthy tender processes, and facilitate cooperation with defense technology start-ups. The move aims to enhance Germany's defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets, though it has drawn criticism from opposition parties over potential waste and lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Oxfam and Save the Children, has issued a dire warning about "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to Israel's siege. The groups report that with supplies depleted, even aid workers are struggling to find food, and malnutrition rates, especially among children, are at record highs. The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health reports over 70 children have died from malnutrition this year. An Israeli government spokesperson denied the existence of a famine, blaming Hamas for disrupting aid distribution.</p>

          <p>With rising inflation and high interest rates, many consumers carry credit card balances, making it crucial to understand how minimum payments are calculated. For a $2,000 balance at a 22% APR, the minimum payment could range from $40 to $60, depending on the issuer's formula, which often involves a percentage of the balance plus interest. Paying only the minimum is a costly long-term strategy, as compounding interest significantly increases the total amount repaid. Experts advise paying more than the minimum whenever possible to reduce debt faster. (not investment advice)</p>

To improve approval odds, experts recommend reducing debt, correcting errors on credit reports, and boosting one's credit score.

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming division. Revenue from this segment grew 16%, led by the success of Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, which helped offset a 16% decline in the traditional consumer products segment. The company's toy business continues to face headwinds from tariffs and shifting retailer orders. Despite an overall revenue dip of 1%, Hasbro raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-centric strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will raise candy prices by a "low double-digit" percentage across its portfolio to combat the unprecedented cost of cocoa. Global cocoa prices have skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, caused by adverse weather and disease, along with chronic underinvestment in farms. In response, Hershey is also shifting focus toward products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of a broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse." The price hikes will affect iconic brands like Hershey Kisses, Reese's, and KitKat over the next several months. (not investment advice)</p>

In a recent interview, Schneider reflects on his creative process, which often involves posing existential questions rather than providing answers, a style influenced by his admiration for figures like David Lynch. He also touches on the band's unexpected success, his background in visual arts, and his collaboration with Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgård, who wrote the album's press bio.

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's recent responses to inquiries about his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, describing them as unconvincing and evasive. After a report detailed a suggestive note Trump allegedly wrote for Epstein's birthday, Trump issued a denial and then attempted to deflect attention by attacking political rivals and reviving unrelated controversies. The author argues that by trying to kill the story, attacking the media, and linking the matter to other disproven claims, Trump's behavior appears more like that of someone with something to hide rather than an innocent individual seeking transparency.</p>

Experts and mental health advocates are calling for urgent reforms, including integrating mental health education into the curriculum, training teachers to identify at-risk students, and creating better support systems.

          <p>For the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion, widespread protests have erupted across Ukraine against President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The demonstrations were sparked by a new law that significantly reduces the independence of two key anti-corruption agencies by placing them under the control of a political appointee. Critics, including EU officials, fear the move is a serious setback for Ukraine's fight against graft and its path to EU membership. Zelenskyy defended the law as necessary to clear the agencies of alleged Russian influence, but protesters view it as a slide toward authoritarianism.</p>

Police warned that even minute amounts of carfentanil can be lethal.
