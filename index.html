          <p>Australia secured a decisive series victory over the West Indies in Jamaica after bowling them out for just 27 runs, the second-lowest score in Test cricket history. Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc was instrumental, taking six wickets for nine runs and surpassing the 400-wicket milestone in his 100th Test match. The devastating batting collapse left the West Indies 176 runs short of their victory target, prompting disappointment from their captain. The teams will next compete in a five-match T20 series.</p>

          <p>Following Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, player Cole Palmer expressed confusion about President Donald Trump joining the team on stage for the trophy celebration. While Palmer, who was named the tournament's top player, knew Trump would be at the game, he was surprised to see him on the stand. The president's appearance alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino highlights their strengthening relationship as the U.S. prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>A large legal cannabis operation in California, raided last week by federal immigration agents, is now under investigation by the state for alleged child labor violations. The Department of Cannabis Control confirmed an active probe into Glass House after receiving a complaint about the employment of minors. During the federal raid, agents arrested 361 people, including what the Department of Homeland Security described as "at least 14 migrant children" rescued from potential exploitation. The company has denied ever employing minors.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left one other critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and smoke, rescuing numerous residents from windows, while five firefighters sustained minor injuries. Officials have called the event an "unfathomable tragedy," though the cause does not currently appear suspicious. A union official later claimed that inadequate fire department staffing may have contributed to the loss of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia, including authorizing weapons for Ukraine and threatening tariffs, is reportedly driven by personal frustration rather than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has ignored his pleas to end the war, making him look weak and like a junior partner in their relationship. After months of deferring to Moscow and believing he could broker a quick peace deal, Trump has grown angry at Putin's repeated escalations, leading him to authorize new aid for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to allow the Trump administration to proceed with mass firings at the Department of Education is being interpreted as a significant expansion of presidential power. The ruling, handed down on the "shadow docket," effectively permits the administration to dismantle a federal agency by eliminating its staff, an action critics argue is a form of unconstitutional impoundment. By allowing the termination of employees in key offices, the Court appears to be letting the president achieve indirectly what the Constitution forbids: the unilateral cancellation of congressionally mandated programs.</p>

Kennedy Jr. framed the move as a positive response from the industry to the administration's focus on removing certain chemicals from food. The agreement, which involves over 40 ice cream companies, is part of a pattern of voluntary industry pacts favored by the administration. Officials also indicated that upcoming dietary guidelines may elevate the status of full-fat dairy products.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has updated its return-to-office policy, requiring corporate employees in the U.S. and Canada to work from the office Monday through Thursday, an increase from the previous three-day mandate. The new rule will take effect in October, and employees who do not wish to comply will be offered a severance package to leave the company. CEO Brian Niccol stated the change is necessary for the company to do its "best work" as it navigates challenges like falling sales. This move aligns Starbucks with other major corporations tightening their remote work policies.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire in Grand Canyon National Park has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, a beloved landmark on the park's North Rim. The lodge, which was first built in the 1920s and rebuilt after a fire in 1932, was one of an estimated 50 to 80 structures lost in the blaze. The National Park Service has closed the North Rim for the remainder of the season due to the "extreme and volatile" fire. The loss of the iconic lodge, a designated National Historic Landmark, is being mourned by officials and past visitors alike.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated he is giving "serious consideration" to stripping comedian Rosie O'Donnell of her U.S. citizenship due to her frequent criticism of him. In a social media post, Trump called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and suggested she should remain in Ireland. The threat, while likely legally unenforceable against a native-born citizen, is part of a pattern of the president targeting political opponents and critics. It raises serious concerns about the use of presidential power to punish free speech.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, D.C., has drawn sharp criticism from the White House, escalating tensions between the two institutions. The project's cost has swelled to $2.5 billion, which the Trump administration is using as a new line of attack against the central bank, already a target for its interest rate policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has defended the project, stating costs are driven by unexpected issues and inflation, and has asked the Fed's inspector general to conduct a review to address the complaints.

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein has evolved from a criminal case into a major political fissure within the MAGA movement. The saga began with Epstein's 2019 arrest and death, which fueled conspiracy theories, often amplified by Donald Trump himself. After the Trump administration's Justice Department recently announced that no "client list" existed and no more files would be released, right-wing commentators who had promoted the theory turned on the administration. This culminated in Trump publicly pleading with his base to stop attacking his attorney general over the issue.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the deadly July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, have been intermittently suspended due to new threatening weather.

The initial flooding killed at least 130 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp, and about 160 people remain missing. The ongoing adverse weather is complicating the massive search effort and posing a continued threat to the hard-hit Hill Country region.</p>

Starting this week, users will be asked to verify their age using a third-party service, either by uploading a selfie or a government ID.

After the original government website for the reports was taken down, the White House had assured continuity by moving them to NASA. Now, NASA has stated it has no legal obligation to host the data, a move critics call a deliberate effort to bury vital information about the dangers of climate change, paid for by taxpayers to inform public safety.</p>

The ruling allows the administration to proceed with mass layoffs and the transfer of departmental functions while the underlying legal challenge continues.

While these products are tobacco-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic to children. Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that although pouch ingestions are a small fraction of all nicotine cases, they are more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospitalization. Health advocates are concerned that flavored products make the pouches attractive to children.</p>
