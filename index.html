Air quality alerts have been issued for millions of residents in multiple states, including Minnesota, Illinois, and Michigan. Concurrently, the U.S. is facing separate weather threats, as the Northeast recovers from heavy rainfall and flash flooding, while the Carolinas and Texas are now on alert for significant flood risks from impending storms.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly called for the Federal Reserve's board of governors to seize control from Chair Jerome Powell and implement substantial interest rate cuts. This comes after the Fed decided to hold its benchmark rate steady, citing the need to assess the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. The call for intervention follows a weak jobs report and reflects Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell, whom he has labeled "stubborn" for not lowering rates to stimulate stronger economic growth.

          <p>Chevron announced second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, although profits saw a significant 44% decline from the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share on $44.82 billion in revenue, beating forecasts. Following its recent $53 billion acquisition of Hess, Chevron anticipates the deal will start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and is targeting $1 billion in annual cost reductions by the end of 2025.

          <p>A group of Senate Republicans, led by Senator Katie Britt, has introduced a bill aimed at stopping noncitizens and illegal immigrants from voting in local Washington, D.C. elections. The proposed legislation would repeal a 2022 D.C. law that granted voting rights to noncitizens in municipal races, a practice currently prohibited in federal elections. Proponents of the bill argue that voting is a core principle of American citizenship, while the D.C. law was enacted to address issues like wealth inequality and police brutality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed considerable weakness in July, adding only 73,000 jobs, which fell well below the 100,000 estimate and raised concerns about a potential economic slowdown. The report was further weakened by substantial downward revisions for May and June, which cut a combined 258,000 jobs from previous totals. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%, and the data has intensified speculation that the Federal Reserve may be compelled to lower interest rates in its upcoming September meeting.

          <p>Yu Zidi, a 12-year-old swimmer from China, has won a bronze medal at the world swimming championships in Singapore, a remarkable achievement for an athlete of her age. She earned the medal by competing in the preliminary heats of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay. Her performance has prompted World Aquatics to review its age-limit rules, which currently allow athletes under 14 to compete if they meet a difficult time standard, sparking a debate about the appropriateness of such young competitors in elite sports.</p>

          <p>An interest-free payment pause for millions of student loan borrowers enrolled in the SAVE forbearance program has ended as of August 1st. Borrowers who do not make payments sufficient to cover accruing interest will now see their debt balances begin to grow again. The Trump administration ended the reprieve, stating the Education Department lacks the authority to grant zero-percent interest. Experts advise borrowers to quickly find a new repayment plan, such as the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, to avoid significant interest accumulation.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is jailed while on trial for rebellion charges, resisted investigators' attempts to question him by taking off his prison uniform and lying on the floor of his cell. This is the latest act of defiance from the ex-leader, who was removed from office after a failed attempt to impose martial law. Investigators, who had a warrant to retrieve him, refrained from using force but stated they would execute the warrant on their next attempt, while Yoon's lawyers cite health issues as the reason for his non-cooperation.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times posits that the "Happy Gilmore" movies, including the new sequel, are more than just comedies, instead conveying a traditional conservative message about the primacy of family. The author argues that in both films, the protagonist Happy Gilmore is motivated not by personal gain but by an altruistic desire to provide for his family, first his grandmother and now his daughter. The article suggests that creator Adam Sandler uses the character to champion a life of purpose found in fulfilling obligations to others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many international aid groups have chosen to remain silent despite facing dramatic funding cuts from the Trump administration, a phenomenon one expert calls "anticipatory silence." This strategy stems from a fear that speaking out could lead to further retaliation and the loss of remaining government contracts, on which many non-profits are financially dependent. While some groups have sued the administration, others engage in quiet, behind-the-scenes diplomacy, creating a tense debate within the sector about the most effective way to respond to the cuts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has opted to incinerate nearly $10 million worth of contraceptives, including IUDs and birth control pills, that were purchased by USAID for distribution in low-income countries. This action is a result of broad funding cuts to global health programs and federal rules prohibiting the U.S. from providing such goods to groups that offer abortion-related services. Critics argue the move is a devastating blow to women's health and a symbol of the administration's hostility towards contraception and reproductive freedom.</p>

This exodus of talent, particularly among young scientists, may signal a shift in global scientific leadership and raises concerns about the future of U.S. climate research and innovation.</p>
