          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in Veracruz, Mexico, has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and injuries to eleven others. The unrest, which included fires within the facility, reportedly erupted due to inmates' anger over extortion and abuse by the Grupo Sombra criminal organization. This incident highlights ongoing issues in Mexico's prison system, such as overcrowding and control by cartels, as the Tuxpan prison was operating beyond its designed capacity. Authorities have since quelled the riot and secured the facility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, Chinese aerospace engineers have proposed a significant upgrade for military drones to dramatically increase their survival rates against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small and medium-sized drones with compact, side-mounted rocket boosters for "terminal evasion." These boosters would allow the drone to perform instantaneous, high-G maneuvers in the final seconds before a potential impact, making it nearly impossible for tracking systems to follow. Digital simulations suggest this technology could improve a drone's survival probability to nearly 90 percent.</p>

          <p>A 51-year-old woman has died and another was seriously injured after being mauled by multiple dogs at Perris Hill Park in San Bernardino, California. Police were initially called to the scene to assist an injured woman when two more dogs charged, prompting an officer to shoot and kill one of them. The deceased victim, Teodora Mendoza, was found nearby with severe injuries. Authorities from San Bernardino Animal Control subsequently removed a total of 14 dogs from the park, and an investigation is underway to determine their origin and involvement in the attacks.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed a disturbing international network, with members in the UK, dedicated to creating and sharing videos of cats and kittens being tortured and killed. The groups, operating on encrypted messaging apps, are believed to have thousands of members, with some UK-based users reportedly discussing adopting kittens from shelters for the purpose of abuse. Animal rights activists have documented the network's extensive activity, noting that a new video of extreme cruelty is uploaded approximately every 14 hours. The findings have prompted police to investigate links between recent local animal cruelty cases and this wider global network.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated new phishing scam is targeting individuals by sending emails that contain a picture of their house and their address, followed by extortion threats. The scammer claims to have compromising video footage and demands payment in Bitcoin to prevent its release. Cyber experts advise that the perpetrators likely obtain addresses from data breaches and use Google Maps to find images, creating a false sense of surveillance. To protect oneself, individuals should verify the image source, scrutinize the sender's email address for authenticity, avoid clicking any links, and immediately change passwords for critical accounts if they suspect a compromise.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected U.S. demands to stop buying oil from Russia and Iran, stating it will protect its national interests and energy security. The U.S. had threatened a 100% tariff as part of broader trade negotiations, aiming to limit funds available to Russia for its war in Ukraine and to Iran for its regional activities. Despite signals of optimism on other trade matters, Beijing's hardline stance on this issue underscores its confidence and the strategic importance of these energy supplies, which it purchases at favorable prices. U.S. officials acknowledged China's position on sovereignty but expressed hope that a broader trade deal could still be reached.</p>

The program will initially target those at the highest risk, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners or STIs. The 4CMenB vaccine, originally developed for meningitis B, has been found to be 30-40% effective against gonorrhoea due to the close relation between the two bacteria. Health officials hope the rollout will prevent up to 100,000 cases and help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of the infection.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey asserts that many people are financially struggling not because of low income, but because they allocate their earnings to debt payments for credit cards, car loans, and student loans. He argues that this cycle of payments enriches lenders while preventing individuals from building their own wealth. Ramsey advocates for a strict financial plan that includes creating a zero-based budget, aggressively paying down debt using the debt snowball method, and paying for purchases with cash instead of financing. This approach, he claims, is how most millionaires build their wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity as women seek to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood, a trend some experts call as revolutionary as the birth control pill.

While some employers now offer it as a benefit, critics and bioethicists raise concerns about the commercialization of fertility, the creation of false hope, and the societal pressures that push women toward delaying childbirth.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson failed to qualify for the 200m final at the U.S. Track and Field Championships, ending her bid to compete in the event at the upcoming World Championships. She finished her heat just one-hundredth of a second behind the final qualifier. This comes during a turbulent week for the 25-year-old athlete, who was arrested over a domestic violence allegation involving her boyfriend. As the defending 100m world champion, Richardson still holds an automatic spot to compete in that event at the championships in September.</p>

          <p>The sale of the iconic American company U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel includes terms that grant President Donald Trump a significant, outsized influence over the company's future. This arrangement, described as a 'golden share,' gives the U.S. government, under his leadership, special rights that could affect corporate decisions, strategic direction, and operations. The deal highlights a novel approach to blending national interest and corporate governance in a major international acquisition. This structure ensures a level of continued American oversight in a key industrial sector, even after its sale to a foreign entity.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a jobs report showed downward revisions for previous months. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett cited the revisions as "hard evidence" justifying the move, though he provided no specific data to support the president's claim that the numbers were "rigged." The firing has drawn sharp criticism from economists and former officials, who warn that it undermines the credibility of government data and sets a dangerous precedent of political interference in the work of independent statistical agencies.

While the snowfall created picturesque scenes, the wild weather also caused widespread disruption, including power outages for tens of thousands of homes, flood warnings, and numerous emergency service responses for stranded vehicles and storm-damaged buildings.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, the Trump administration has denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, contradicting earlier public statements from White House officials. Previously, adviser Stephen Miller had stated the administration was looking to set a goal of at least 3,000 arrests per day by ICE. However, government lawyers now assert that no such policy or directive has been issued to the Department of Homeland Security or ICE. The discrepancy emerged during an ongoing lawsuit in California challenging the constitutionality of immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area.</p>
