          <p>London's Tate Modern gallery has announced it will extend its opening times to 9:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays starting this autumn. The change aims to make the gallery more accessible, particularly for younger audiences and those visiting after work. This decision builds on the success of the Tate Modern Lates program, which has attracted over 750,000 people since 2016 with curated evening events. The move is supported by London's mayor as a boost to the city's cultural nightlife.</p>

          <p>The upcoming swimming world championships in Singapore are set to feature a major showdown between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. Their race in the 800m freestyle is highly anticipated, as McIntosh is the only swimmer to have defeated Ledecky in this event in the last 15 years. McIntosh is in historic form, aiming to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished. This duel is seen as a potential generational shift in the sport, testing Ledecky's long-standing dominance.</p>

          <p>A prominent pro-life group is celebrating the upcoming closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, including what they describe as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. The organization, 40 Days for Life, called the shutdowns a "tremendous victory" for their movement. Planned Parenthood cited rising operational costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates as reasons for the closures. This development occurs as Republican-led states continue to implement abortion restrictions following the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>

The clashes stem from a century-old territorial dispute, and recent fighting has led to casualties and civilian evacuations.
