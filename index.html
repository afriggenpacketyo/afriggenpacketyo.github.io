            <p>The Supreme Court issued an emergency order halting the Trump administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants to an El Salvador prison before they could challenge their deportation. The late-night intervention is a rebuke to the government, signaling a shift in the court's approach to the administration. The court acted swiftly, expressing distrust of the Justice Department's claims and ensuring the migrants' due process rights. The decision indicates a potential conflict between the president and the court regarding constitutional principles.</p>
