          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a formal proposal for a new round of peace talks with Russia, aiming to accelerate negotiations for a ceasefire. This diplomatic effort comes as Russia continues its intense aerial assaults, launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in overnight attacks. In parallel developments, Australia is delivering 49 Abrams tanks to bolster Ukraine's defense, and Kyiv has accused Moscow of weaponizing deportations by stranding Ukrainian citizens in Georgia without proper identification documents, creating a humanitarian issue.</p>

          <p>At least 30 people were injured, with seven in critical condition, after a car deliberately drove into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood. The incident occurred after the driver was reportedly removed from a nearby business for being disruptive. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and physically assaulted him, during which an unknown assailant shot the driver. The shooter remains at large, and police are investigating the motive for the initial attack while the driver undergoes surgery.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that newly declassified documents reveal the Obama administration and its national security team manufactured intelligence to frame Donald Trump as a Russian asset. The author contends that this was part of a "treasonous conspiracy" originating from a Hillary Clinton campaign plan to distract from her email scandal. The piece claims top officials, including the CIA and FBI directors, were aware the Russia collusion narrative was a hoax but proceeded with investigations and surveillance to undermine Trump's candidacy and presidency.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships was officially presented with their gold medals during the London Diamond League meeting. The team was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified due to a doping confession from athlete Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. After a lengthy process of reallocation, the British athletes, including Roger Black and Iwan Thomas, finally received their medals in front of a home crowd of 60,000. Pettigrew, who was also stripped of a 2000 Olympic title, died by suicide in 2010.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian air assault across Ukraine has resulted in at least three deaths and widespread damage in ten different regions. According to President Zelensky, Russia launched over 340 drones and 35 missiles, with strikes hitting a residential building in Odesa and industrial sites in Pavlohrad. Critical infrastructure was also damaged in the northeastern city of Sumy, causing power outages. While Ukraine's military reported intercepting the majority of the projectiles, the barrage underscores Russia's intensified campaign of long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary Marco Rubio, has reportedly revoked the U.S. visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges. This action is part of an escalating campaign by the White House to support former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move targets the judge leading the investigation and his allies on the court. It follows a recent U.S. announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, a decision that has been widely condemned in Brazil as unacceptable foreign interference in its judicial process and national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that unsealing the grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases would not be enough to satisfy his critics. In a social media post, he wrote that "nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics." This comment comes after Trump, facing mounting pressure, requested that the Department of Justice produce the grand jury testimony for potential release, subject to court approval. His post suggests that the pressure campaign is ongoing and that he may not take further steps to address the concerns.</p>

          <p>An attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would trigger a significant and unprecedented legal battle with uncertain consequences for the economy. Legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to remove Powell without cause, which would likely lead to a lawsuit reaching the Supreme Court. The move could destabilize financial markets by undermining the central bank's independence, potentially leading to higher inflation and interest rates if investors lose faith in the Fed's credibility. The political maneuvering is seen by some as an attempt to create a scapegoat should the economy falter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway argues that "follow your passion" is the worst piece of career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. He contends that real success comes from finding the intersection of what you are good at and what can be financially viable. Galloway, who became a self-made millionaire, advises that one's passion may not align with their talents or market opportunities. Instead of blindly following a passion, he and other leaders like Mastercard's CEO suggest identifying your strengths, embracing rejection, and pivoting toward opportunities where your skills can create value.</p>

          <p>This article explores the resurgence of tanning, not just as a beauty trend but as an ideological statement, particularly within circles aligned with the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. The piece notes the prominent tans of political figures and the proliferation of sun-seeking advice in alternative-health spaces, which often question mainstream guidance on sun safety and sunscreen. This new sun worship is framed as a rejection of the scientific establishment and a return to nature. It reflects a broader cultural comeback of tanning, even as dermatologists warn of the well-established risks of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm. This move is part of a broader plan to reduce agency staff by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The administration claims the restructuring will save money and allow for a greater focus on science within other program offices.
