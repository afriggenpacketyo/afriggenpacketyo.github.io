        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has vehemently denounced recent US airstrikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea, branding them an "act of tyranny." He has called for criminal proceedings against US officials if investigations confirm any Colombian deaths, questioning the necessity of missile strikes when peaceful arrests are possible. The Trump administration justifies these actions as vital for curbing the flow of fentanyl and other illegal narcotics into the US, yet legal experts and United Nations officials have voiced concerns over potential breaches of international human rights laws. Petro emphasized that prior collaborations with American agencies successfully interdicted maritime cocaine shipments without any fatalities, underscoring his belief that lethal force is disproportionate and unnecessary in such operations. This article highlights a significant diplomatic dispute over anti-narcotics strategies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appears "much more willing to talk" about peace, a change he also perceives in Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lula is actively reviving a joint Brazil-China peace plan for the ongoing conflict, underscoring the vital importance of the United Nations taking a leading role in these negotiations to represent all member states. He reiterated his previous call to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the formation of a contact group, stressing that this proposal still stands. This renewed diplomatic effort follows a significant, albeit rare, alignment between China and Brazil on a US-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council, suggesting a potential shift in the global landscape surrounding the Ukraine war and offering a glimmer of hope for future dialogue.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely advanced on Thursday, contrasting with a second consecutive day of tech stock declines on Wall Street, which saw Nvidia and Oracle fall. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained, boosted by Chinese automaker Chery Automobile's successful 11% debut and Xiaomi's new device launches. Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi remained near flat, though defense stocks performed well, while Taiwan's Taiex saw a dip with heavyweight TSMC down amid reports of Intel seeking investment from Apple. US stock futures showed little change as investors awaited weekly jobless claims data, a key indicator for potential Federal Reserve monetary policy adjustments, particularly amidst increasing concerns about a weakening labor market.

Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene where the van reportedly struck the couple while reversing, then sped away from the location. The NYPD's Highway District’s Collision Investigation Squad is currently conducting an ongoing investigation, but as of now, no arrests have been made, and the identity of the deceased is awaiting family notification.</p>

Chery is rapidly expanding its presence in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with plans to launch new SUV models.

          <p>The White House has announced a significant shift in its approach to a potential government shutdown, threatening permanent layoffs for some federal workers instead of the traditional temporary furloughs. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget outlined plans for a "reduction in force," specifically targeting programs deemed "not consistent with the president's priorities." This aggressive strategy, championed by President Trump's budget director, aims to cut government programs despite strong opposition from Democrats and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has vehemently criticized the memo, labeling it an "attempt at intimidation" as budget negotiations remain deadlocked, raising concerns about the stability of federal employment and the impact on government services.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents and data expose England's Environment Agency (EA) as significantly struggling to monitor serious pollution incidents, with investigators failing to attend nearly a third of serious water industry incidents in 2024. The agency frequently relied on water companies, often the polluters themselves, for updates and downgraded over 1,000 potentially serious incidents without conducting on-site inspections. Critics contend that the EA is "hollowed out" and incapable of holding polluters accountable, citing staff shortages that have also led to thousands of canceled water quality tests. While the EA maintains it responds to all reports, campaigners emphasize a systemic failure that allows polluters to operate with perceived impunity, undermining environmental protection efforts.</p>

          <p>Former US President Barack Obama has articulated that the United States is currently embroiled in a "tug of war" between two fundamentally different visions for its future. Speaking in London, Obama criticized populist movements, including those led by President Trump, for advocating a return to a more conservative and hierarchical worldview. He also acknowledged that progressives, by becoming "smug" and "complacent" in earlier decades, had inadvertently allowed these opposing forces to gain ground. Obama emphasized that the values of democracy and inclusivity, once taken for granted, are now being rigorously tested, highlighting a critical moment in American political identity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has alleged "triple sabotage" at the United Nations, claiming a series of technical mishaps disrupted his visit and speech. He reported an escalator halting abruptly, his teleprompter failing, and his microphone being inaudible during his address to the General Assembly. Trump demanded an immediate investigation, with the Secret Service reportedly involved, calling the incidents a "REAL DISGRACE." The UN spokesperson, however, attributed the escalator stop to a US delegation videographer inadvertently triggering a safety function. This article highlights Trump's strong reaction and the contrasting explanations for the events, leading to a diplomatic incident dubbed "escalatorgate."</p>

          <p>The US tech sector and other industries are scrambling to adapt to a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program for skilled foreign workers. While the White House clarified the fee currently applies only to future applicants, it creates significant burdens, especially for startups and smaller firms. Experts warn this could cripple companies unable to afford the cost, potentially leading to offshoring operations and a "brain drain" that negatively impacts innovation and economic growth. Critics argue the policy, justified by concerns of H-1B program abuse, fails to consider its broader economic consequences or benefit American workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at a UK government lab have achieved a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology, designing an innovative exhaust system that dramatically reduces the extreme heat generated within fusion reactors. This "Super-X divertor" creates a neutral gas buffer, effectively protecting the reactor walls and addressing a major challenge in making fusion energy practical on a mass scale. Published in Nature Energy, this innovation is the result of a collaborative effort and represents a crucial advancement towards developing robust control of plasma exhaust in future fusion machines. Fusion energy, unlike nuclear fission, promises a clean and abundant power source without producing long-lasting radioactive waste, holding immense potential for reducing fossil fuel dependence and accelerating the adoption of renewable energy sources globally.</p>

          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, has been sentenced to one year in prison for the voluntary manslaughter of his girlfriend’s former partner, Luis Morin, an incident that occurred while Rodriguez was on duty. Initially, law enforcement had deemed the 2014 shooting justified, but a subsequent civil lawsuit exposed that Rodriguez was romantically involved with Morin's ex-partner, who had previously made 911 calls about Morin. Prosecutors alleged that Rodriguez ambushed Morin without identifying himself as an officer, leading to a struggle. The district attorney's office strongly objected to the lenient one-year sentence, having recommended a 10-year term, raising significant concerns about accountability within law enforcement.</p>
