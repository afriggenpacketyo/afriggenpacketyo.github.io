        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful. She contends that being flawed is essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. Ross suggests that mothers often receive messages implying they are not doing enough, which can negatively impact children by creating unrealistic expectations about relationships. Ross encourages mothers to give themselves a break and recognize that their imperfections are a valuable part of parenting, teaching children about give and take in close relationships.</p>

          <p>In a stunning defeat, the reigning MLS champion LA Galaxy suffered a 7-0 loss to the New York Red Bulls at Sports Illustrated Stadium. This marked the Galaxy's worst defeat in history and the Red Bulls' largest victory in terms of goal difference. The Galaxy's coach, Greg Vanney, acknowledged the team's poor performance and emphasized the need for rapid improvement, as the team has struggled to secure wins this season. The match was a rematch of the previous season's final, where the Galaxy won their sixth MLS title, making the defeat even more shocking for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. This offer references the unsuccessful 2022 peace talks held in Istanbul shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion. Putin stated Russia's commitment to serious negotiations and didn't rule out a ceasefire during direct talks. The proposal came after leaders from France, the U.K., Germany, and Poland urged Moscow to accept a 30-day ceasefire, supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, threatening increased sanctions if Russia doesn't comply.</p>

          <p>A Maryland oral surgeon, James Ryan, is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with surgical anesthetics, ultimately leading to her death. Ryan had reportedly admitted to noticing Harris when she was just 14 years old, and later, as adults, he provided her with habit-forming drugs. Harris's mother suspected Ryan's involvement from the beginning, and authorities discovered powerful anesthetics in Harris's system after her death. Texts revealed Ryan offered and administered drugs to Harris, leading to a charge of 'depraved heart murder,' reflecting a reckless disregard for her life.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the rate from a year ago. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season, with sales of previously occupied homes declining in March.</p>

This signals ongoing financial pressures for the Saudi state oil giant as crude prices struggle to recover and global demand slows.

          <p>President Donald Trump characterized the initial discussions between American and Chinese officials in Switzerland as being "very good," indicating a "total reset" in US-China trade relations. Trump noted the change had been negotiated in a friendly and constructive manner, with both sides expressing a desire to see an opening up of China to American business. The talks are taking place amid an escalating trade war that has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel are commemorating 60 years of diplomatic relations, but the ongoing war in Gaza casts a shadow over the anniversary. Despite Germany's commitment to Israel's security, criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza is growing, particularly regarding humanitarian obligations. The visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog to Berlin and the planned visit to a kibbutz near Gaza highlight the complexities and sensitivities surrounding the relationship, with Germany grappling with its historical responsibility and current concerns about the conflict.</p>

          <p>US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, played a critical role in pulling India and Pakistan back from the brink of a full-blown conflict, leading to a ceasefire agreement. The intervention came after days of escalating clashes and heightened rhetoric, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to the Pakistani Army Chief proving crucial. While India and Pakistan traded accusations of ceasefire violations hours after the deal, experts say the US, UK, and Saudi Arabia worked to de-escalate tensions, highlighting the importance of international diplomacy in managing regional conflicts.</p>

This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's move away from fossil fuels and its commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas, reflecting Africa's growing energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
