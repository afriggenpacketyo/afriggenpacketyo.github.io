          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, urging Hamas to accept its terms for an immediate cessation of military operations. The proposal includes the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans, Hamas's disarmament, and its exclusion from future governance. The plan also outlines a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee, overseen by a new international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump and featuring former UK PM Tony Blair, to manage Gaza's transition. Netanyahu affirmed Israel's "full backing" to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects the agreement, while the plan also leaves open the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Tuesday, with significant investor focus on the impending Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate decision. A Reuters poll indicates widespread expectations for the RBA to maintain its cash rate at 3.6%, primarily due to persistent high inflation constraining its ability to ease monetary policy. Shier Lee Lim, lead FX and macro strategist at Convera, highlighted that any shift in the RBA's tone or forward guidance could substantially influence AUD crosses, especially following recent volatility in building approvals. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix saw slight dips, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi recorded modest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to intensify into a hurricane by Tuesday morning, though its projected path will steer it away from the southeastern United States, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday evening, Imelda was bringing tropical storm conditions and heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, with its center located north of Great Abaco Island and maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. A hurricane watch has been issued for Bermuda, which the storm is expected to approach on Wednesday. Swells generated by Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are anticipated to affect the Bahamas and much of the U.S. East Coast, posing life-threatening surf and rip current risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following President Trump's directive to deploy 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield asserts that the president lacks the constitutional authority to federalize the National Guard for the stated purpose of protecting federal property during protests. Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson argue that local authorities are fully capable of maintaining public safety without federal interference, viewing the deployment as a political show of force. The White House, however, defends the action as a lawful exercise of authority to protect federal assets and personnel amidst violent riots.</p>

          <p>The Senate has returned to Washington with less than two days to fund the government, facing a significant stalemate between Democrats and Republicans that has increased the likelihood of a shutdown. While the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution until November 21, Democrats rejected it, pushing for a counter-proposal to fund the government through October with key priorities like extending health insurance subsidies and rolling back Medicaid restrictions. Both parties are engaged in a pre-emptive blame game, with Republicans accusing Democrats of hostage-taking and Democrats insisting on serious negotiations. A meeting between congressional leaders and President Trump concluded without a breakthrough, signaling continued gridlock.</p>

          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has announced a record-breaking seizure of one million pounds of cocaine during fiscal year 2025. This massive haul, equivalent to 378 million lethal doses, represents an estimated $11.34 billion blow to cartels and narco-terrorist organizations. JIATF-S, led by U.S. Southern Command, collaborates with partner nations to disrupt illicit drug flows through the vast transit zone between South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Trump administration has intensified its counter-narcotics strategy, including designating groups like the Sinaloa Cartel as foreign terrorist organizations and deploying naval assets to the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>California and other Democratic-led states have filed a new lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the unlawful withholding of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal security and disaster relief funding. The states contend this punitive action is directly tied to their "sanctuary" immigration policies and follows a recent federal judge's ruling against conditioning similar grants on immigration enforcement cooperation. Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the move as an illegal attempt to coerce states into federal immigration campaigns they are not legally obliged to support. The lawsuit argues that the funding, essential for disaster preparedness and first responders, is being reallocated based on political alignment rather than objective threat and risk assessments.</p>

          <p>If a government shutdown occurs, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed pay or potential layoffs, yet members of Congress will continue to receive their salaries without interruption. This is mandated by Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution, which guarantees compensation for Senators and Representatives, and a 1983 law that established their pay as a permanent appropriation, not requiring annual renewal. Most members earn $174,000 annually, a rate unchanged since 2009. While essential federal workers are required to continue their duties without immediate pay, and non-essential employees are furloughed, congressional staffers' pay is also delayed, though a 2019 law guarantees them back pay once funding is restored.</p>

The court filing explicitly states that this settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or fault on the part of YouTube.

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies by the October 1 fiscal year deadline, preventing them from spending unauthorized money under the Antideficiency Act. This forces the cessation of all non-essential government functions, with each agency determining which operations are critical. Essential services, including active-duty military, many federal law enforcement officers, and air traffic controllers, continue to operate, but their pay is delayed until funding is restored. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare remain funded, though administrative services may be disrupted.

          <p>Once Upon a Farm, the baby food company co-founded by actress Jennifer Garner, has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker "OFRM." The company reported a robust 66% revenue increase in the first six months of the year but acknowledged in its filing that it has a "history of losses" and cannot guarantee future profitability. Founded in 2015, the Berkeley-based company offers over 115 organic, non-GMO, no-added-sugar products for babies and children, drawing inspiration from Garner's family farm. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are serving as joint lead underwriters for the proposed offering. (not investment advice)</p>

Potential reasons for the unprecedented meeting range from a "loyalty check" and a public dressing-down by Hegseth to a major announcement regarding national defense or significant personnel changes.

          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey shared that he deliberately maintained short conversations with his mother, Kay, for approximately eight years due to her tendency to share personal information with the media. This "hiatus" began after Kay, fueled by maternal pride, gave a media tour of his childhood home without his consent, leading McConaughey to frequently read about his private life in the news. He explained that he would relay personal details on Sunday, only to see them published by Tuesday. The dynamic of their relationship shifted once McConaughey felt more secure and stable in his fame, leading him to now humorously encourage her to "say whatever the hell she wants" without reservation.</p>

While James continues to perform at an elite level, his "maybe" response regarding playing next year leaves the team in limbo, impacting future planning. The article explores three possible scenarios: James retiring at season's end, embarking on a mid-season farewell tour, or a messy departure due to roster disagreements or contract expiration. The Lakers' performance, especially with new additions like Luka Doncic, will likely heavily influence James's ultimate decision, making this season a critical and potentially unpredictable one for the franchise.</p>

This early-stage platform integrates diverse sensors from space, the ocean, the air, and on the ground to identify and analyze potential threats in real-time, including flight trajectories, weapon types, and distinguishing between true warheads and decoys. The system is designed to transmit and analyze massive data volumes at high speed through highly secure military networks, even under interference or disruption. While representing the first known missile defense system with such extensive coverage, a fundamental architectural plan for its full implementation has yet to be established.</p>

These features allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to their teens' accounts, enabling customized settings and automatic restrictions on content such as graphic material, sexual or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals. This initiative follows a wrongful death lawsuit and mounting public pressure regarding teen safety, with OpenAI requiring parental consent for users aged 13-18. Parents can also opt to receive notifications if their child exhibits potential self-harm signs, with OpenAI developing protocols for contacting emergency services in imminent danger situations, though acknowledging that guardrails are not entirely foolproof.</p>
