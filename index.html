          <p>Two NHS trusts in Shropshire and Leeds have been removed from a national review into significant maternity care failures, a decision that has shocked families. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was dropped due to an ongoing police investigation into hundreds of baby deaths, while the Leeds trust is now subject to a separate inquiry. Critics of the decision fear that without the inclusion of these key cases, the national review will fail to uncover the full scope of systemic issues and prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>The UK's annual inflation rate held at 3.8% for the third consecutive month, coming in cooler than the 4% peak forecasted by the Bank of England and economists. This persistent, though not accelerating, inflation complicates the central bank's decision on a potential interest rate cut in November. While some factors like lower food prices offered relief, sticky core inflation and mixed economic growth data suggest the Bank of England may maintain a cautious stance. (not investment advice)</p>

The bank now expects its return on tangible equity to exceed 11%, despite a 7% decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit compared to the previous year.

          <p>Over 850 influential figures, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Virgin's Richard Branson, and AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, have signed a statement urging a halt to the development of AI "superintelligence." The signatories warn that creating AI surpassing human cognitive abilities poses severe risks, from economic obsolescence to potential human extinction. They are calling for a ban until a scientific consensus on safety and control is established, reflecting growing concern within the tech community itself.</p>

          <p>Apple is facing engineering challenges in the development of a large, 18-inch foldable iPad, pushing its potential release from 2028 to 2029 or later. The project, part of Apple's push for more innovative devices, is struggling with issues related to weight, features, and the high cost of its complex foldable display technology. Prototypes reportedly resemble a Mac laptop when closed and would use a vibrant OLED screen, with a projected price of around $3,000.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk launched a personal attack against NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, claiming he is not intelligent enough for the job. The criticism followed NASA's announcement that it would accept proposals from rivals to SpaceX for building moon landers to ensure it wins the "second space race" against China. Musk defended his company's progress on the Starship rocket system, asserting it is moving "like lightning" and will ultimately complete the entire moon mission.</p>

          <p>A recent poll from the Public Religion Research Institute reveals that a majority of Americans, 56%, agree with the sentiment that Donald Trump is a "potentially dangerous dictator whose power should be limited." This figure has increased since April, suggesting that the message of recent "No Kings" anti-Trump rallies resonates with a significant portion of the public. The survey reinforces other polling data indicating widespread concern over Trump exceeding his presidential authority and challenging the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Construction has officially commenced on a new ballroom at the White House, with demolition of a portion of the East Wing underway. President Trump confirmed the project, which he stated is being privately funded at a cost of $250 million, will provide a much-needed larger space for hosting major functions.

          <p>Japan's exports grew by 4.2% in September compared to the previous year, ending a four-month streak of declines, primarily driven by strong demand from Asia. However, this growth was partially offset by a significant 13.3% drop in exports to the United States, with auto shipments being particularly affected despite a recent trade deal reducing tariffs. The data reflects a complex trade environment for Japan, with regional strengths balancing weaknesses in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>
