            <h2>Malaysian Durian Sales Soar in China Due to High Demand</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 01:31:07 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Malaysian durian exports to China have surged this year, driven by increasing demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit among Chinese consumers. Improved logistics and a steady supply have boosted Malaysian durian growers' confidence, with expectations of a 30% increase in exports this year. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree before being collected, making them particularly appealing to affluent Chinese consumers. This growing popularity creates significant opportunities for Malaysian growers to expand their market share in China.</p>

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russian attacks were ongoing in some areas. Zelensky expressed skepticism about Moscow's intentions, suggesting the truce was merely an attempt to create a false impression of a ceasefire. He affirmed Ukraine's willingness to reciprocate a genuine and unconditional cessation of hostilities, proposing an extension of the truce beyond the initial 30-hour period to demonstrate Russia's true commitment to de-escalation.</p>

This effort is driven by residents in some Illinois counties seeking to separate from the Chicago area. However, the plan requires approval from the Illinois government and the U.S. Congress, and Illinois officials have expressed skepticism. This move reflects political divisions, with the Chicago area controlled by Democrats and much of Illinois represented by Republicans, while Indiana's government is Republican-led.</p>

            <p>Sierra Friar, an 11-year-old, provided crucial testimony in the murder case of her father, Aaron Friar, by identifying her sister's boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, as being outside the house the morning of the murder. This information led detectives to track MacFarlane's cellphone and ultimately locate Aaron Friar's body.
