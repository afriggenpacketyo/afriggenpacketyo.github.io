          <h2>Traditional British Television Faces Challenges from US Streaming Giants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British television is grappling with how to survive in an era dominated by US streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon, facing financial constraints and shifting viewing habits. Some industry insiders suggest mergers or increased cooperation among UK broadcasters, such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5, while others argue that distinctiveness is key to serving viewers. The potential end of traditional terrestrial TV by 2035 raises questions about the future of British-originated content and the need for a strategy to ensure its survival. The BBC's Director General is expected to address embracing the digital age in an upcoming speech, amid discussions of a shared streaming service under iPlayer to compete with US rivals.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years.

The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and potentially to the governor's office for clemency consideration.

          <p>A forthcoming book, 'Original Sin,' by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, explores how former President Biden's aides managed concerns about his age and mental acuity during his time in office. The book recounts instances of Biden forgetting names and displaying physical frailty, leading to aides creating a 'protective political cocoon'. While lacking a single major revelation, the book compiles numerous anecdotes and observations that reflect his decline. Despite pressure from Democrats, Biden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, revealing a reluctance within the Democratic Party to publicly address Biden's waning abilities.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are targeting online pornography with the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which aims to criminalize the transmission of obscene content across state lines. The bill seeks to update the definition of obscenity to suit modern content, replacing subjective standards with practical ones. The IODA defines obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interests, depicts actual or simulated sex acts, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Supporters of the bill argue it will equip law enforcement with the tools needed to remove dangerous material from the internet.</p>

          <p>Federal judges across the United States are facing a disturbing trend of 'pizza doxxing,' where unknown individuals order unsolicited pizza deliveries to their homes as a form of intimidation. In some cases, the recipient is listed as Daniel Anderl, the late son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, whose son was killed in 2020 by a gunman targeting her. The U.S. Marshals Service is investigating these incidents, which are viewed as a form of psychological warfare against judges. Security analysts warn that such tactics could be used to confirm addresses for potential future attacks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pledged to lift all sanctions against Syria, stating it is time for the country to move forward with 'a chance at greatness'. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump also said the U.S. has 'no stronger partner' than Saudi Arabia. Day one of his tour included the announcement of a $142 billion arms deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, as well as other investments that could eventually be worth $1 trillion. Trump's visit to the Gulf aims to strike financial deals and promote economic development as a means to transcend violence and division in the Middle East.</p>

This proposal, presented by Iranâ€™s foreign minister to an American special envoy, involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from participating nations. The plan aims to be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address U.S. concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The proposal is still in early stages and faces challenges due to political tensions and potential reluctance from private American companies to invest in Iran.</p>
