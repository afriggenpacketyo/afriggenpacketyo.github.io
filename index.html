          <p>Kansas City is trying a new approach to address its homeless crisis, focusing on a system that aims to get people back on their feet within 30 days. The city's homelessness prevention coordinator, Josh Henges, emphasizes the need for coordinated resources among churches, aid organizations, and shelters. The goal is to achieve "functional zero," ensuring anyone who becomes homeless is quickly rehoused and supported. The approach includes building trust, providing safe shelter, and addressing core issues like addiction and mental health. Optimism score is 60, as the new strategy shows promise but requires significant coordination and resources.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, providing economic relief to the war-torn country, during a state visit to Saudi Arabia. The decision came after discussions with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with Trump expected to meet Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. The move was met with cheers in Riyadh and is seen as a way to stabilize the region. Syrian officials hailed the decision as a new beginning for reconstruction. Optimism score is 60, as this could help Syria rebuild but depends on the new leader's actions.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental and physical decline while in the White House and how his aides managed concerns about his age. The book describes instances of Biden forgetting names and appearing frail, leading aides to script meetings and limit his exposure. The book highlights the reluctance of Democrats to openly discuss Biden's declining abilities, even after his defeat. Aides are reportedly seeking to shift the blame for his decline onto Biden and his inner circle. Optimism score is 30, given the concerns about a former leader's capabilities.</p>

          <p>GOP lawmakers are targeting online pornography with a proposed interstate ban on obscene content. Senator Mike Lee and Representative Mary Miller introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which would make it illegal to transmit obscene content across state lines and clarify the definition of obscenity. The bill aims to update the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age and make it easier to prosecute offenders. The IODA defines obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Optimism score is 45, given the potential for both positive and negative impacts on free speech and personal freedoms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, which offered deportation protections and work permits to over 8,000 Afghans. The Department of Homeland Security will wind down TPS for Afghans on July 12, citing an improved security situation and stabilizing economy in Afghanistan.

          <p>Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson were reinstated by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, making both eligible for the sport's Hall of Fame after their careers were tarnished by sports gambling scandals.

          <p>Family doctors in England are deeply divided on the issue of assisted dying, according to BBC research on plans to legalise the practice. The findings give a unique insight into how strongly many GPs feel about the proposed new law and highlight how personal beliefs and experiences are shaping doctors' views on the issue. BBC News sent more than 5,000 GPs a questionnaire asking whether they agreed with changing the law to allow assisted dying for certain terminally ill people in England and Wales. More than 1,000 GPs replied, with about 500 telling us they were against an assisted dying law and about 400 saying they were in favour. Optimism score is 50, as the debate is complex and opinions are strongly divided.</p>
