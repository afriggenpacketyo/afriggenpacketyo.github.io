          <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" would increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade and leave 10.9 million more people without health insurance by 2034. House Republicans have defended the bill, claiming it will spur economic growth that will offset the increased deficit, although the CBO projects the spending cuts at $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The bill, which has already passed the House, is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before returning to the House for final approval. The bill is receiving heavy criticism from Elon Musk, who called it an "abomination." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Male beauty standards are evolving, with a growing emphasis on hypermasculinity influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces. This trend focuses on impressing other men, often accompanied by misogyny, rather than appealing to women, which is leading to trends like shaving off eyelashes. This shift mirrors feminism's efforts to empower women to define beauty for themselves, independent of male approval, though some men's communities online maintain the denigration of women. The pursuit of these standards is leading to body dysmorphia among young men, similar to what young women have long experienced.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists were charged with conspiracy and smuggling after attempting to clear US customs with a plant disease-causing fungus, Fusarium graminearum. The FBI said the scientific literature described the fungus’ potential use as an agricultural weapon and the incident posed “an imminent threat to public safety”. Fusarium graminearum is found across the US and the world in temperate and semitropical regions and infects several types of crops, including barley, oats, rice and wheat.</p>
