          <p>Amazon Web Services is enhancing its Graviton4 chip with increased network bandwidth, aiming to provide a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for AI training. AWS has invested significantly in Anthropic, building an AI supercomputer called Project Rainier to support the startup's Claude Opus 4 AI model using Trainium2 GPUs. This move signifies AWS's commitment to reducing AI training costs and competing directly with established semiconductor players. The Graviton4 chip, developed by Amazon's Annapurna Labs, showcases the success of the company's custom chip strategy, positioning it as a strong contender in the AI infrastructure space. The development of these chips provides companies with more options when it comes to building out their AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Senate has approved the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, marking a legislative milestone for the crypto industry. The act sets guardrails including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, and grants authority to the Treasury Secretary to oversee the market. The bill now proceeds to the House, where reconciliation with their version, STABLE, will be necessary, focusing on differing regulatory authorities. The GENIUS Act's passage represents a turning point for the digital asset industry and President Trump's crypto ventures, though it restricts non-financial Big Tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins.

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents at a federal immigration court while observing proceedings. Lander was taken into custody for allegedly assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, but charges were later dropped after intervention from New York Governor Kathy Hochul. Lander stated he was escorting a defendant out of court to prevent ICE detention and criticized the government's stripping of due process rights from undocumented immigrants.

          <p>President Donald Trump is extending the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business for the third time, providing an additional 90 days for a deal to be finalized.

          <p>High-ranking officials from the United States and China recently concluded trade talks in London, but the lack of official readouts has fueled speculation and uncertainty about the discussions. The silence suggests potential tensions and a shift in the balance of power, with China possibly negotiating from a stronger position due to its export controls on rare earth elements. This round of negotiations may represent a turning point in the US-China trade war, shifting the focus from tariffs to supply chain choke points.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, with Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment site, being a potential target. This consideration follows allegations from Israel that Iran is rapidly advancing towards building nuclear weapons.

The Trump administration has stated that the U.S. is not currently involved in Israel's offensive but has not ruled out future involvement, with recent social media posts raising questions about the extent of U.S. engagement.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing the highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with the majority of infections linked to an outbreak in West Texas that has resulted in two deaths. Nationwide, over 1,197 cases have been confirmed across at least 32 states, prompting concerns about declining vaccination rates. Health officials emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine, while urging individuals to get vaccinated to prevent further spread.

          <p>The increasing demand for artificial intelligence and data storage is projected to significantly increase electricity consumption, potentially leading to higher electricity bills for consumers. The spread of data centers across the U.S. is a key factor driving this trend, with electricity demand expected to increase by 16% by 2029. Utilities are building new infrastructure and raising rates to meet the skyrocketing demand, raising concerns about transparency and fairness for everyday households. The heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the electrical grid.</p>

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies are urging the Supreme Court to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs, citing the significant impact on businesses and consumers. The companies argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs. Their lawsuit is separate from another challenge to Trump's tariffs that was filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade. The companies are requesting the Supreme Court to hear arguments on the matter during a special September sitting or in October.</p>

          <p>Channel smugglers are adopting new tactics, using "taxi boats" to pick up migrants waiting in the sea off the French coast, making it harder for police to intercept them. French police are struggling to halt the increasing number of people attempting to reach the UK in small boats, but current operational rules limit their ability to intervene at sea. The new taxi boat system allows smugglers to maintain more control and potentially reduces chaos, but it also gives young men an advantage over women and children. The UK's perceived attractiveness to migrants remains a key factor driving these crossings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing whether President Trump can deploy California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities, with judges expressing skepticism about the state's arguments against the deployment. The legal battle centers on whether Trump exceeded his authority under Title 10 when he deployed the National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids. The court is considering whether Trump properly notified Governor Newsom of the deployment and whether the protests constituted a "rebellion" justifying federal intervention. The outcome could have significant implications for the balance of power between the federal government and states.</p>
