        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expression 'Das crazy,' a hybrid of German and English, has been voted the German Youth Word of the Year for 2025, reflecting the influence of internet and meme culture on language. The term is praised for its versatility, used to express surprise or speechlessness, and its deliberate grammatical incorrectness highlights a playful break from linguistic rules. Chosen through an online vote by publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the selection underscores the trend towards brevity and the dominance of English in youth slang. It narrowly beat 'goonen,' a term for excessive self-gratification.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management, signaling potential strategic changes. The move follows shareholder discontent over KDP's planned all-cash merger with coffee company JDE Peet's, a deal that heavily favors majority owner JAB Holdings and has caused KDP's stock to fall significantly. Starboard, known for its operational expertise, may seek to influence the company's direction, restore investor confidence, and unlock value, similar to its successful engagement with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers during a similarly unpopular merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A grassroots movement in Missouri, called People Not Politicians, is actively collecting signatures to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot, aiming to overturn a newly enacted gerrymandered congressional map. The Republican-drawn map, signed into law last month, is designed to eliminate one of the state's Democratic districts in Kansas City. Despite facing legal challenges from the state's attorney general, volunteers have gathered over 100,000 signatures, fueled by voter resentment over political maneuvers that dilute their voting power. The effort reflects a broader national battle over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The British military has reported that a ship caught fire in the Gulf of Aden, approximately 130 miles east of Aden, Yemen, after being struck by an unknown projectile. According to maritime security firm Ambrey, the vessel is a Cameroon-flagged tanker, and radio communications indicated the crew was preparing to abandon ship amid a search-and-rescue operation. This attack is consistent with the ongoing campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeting commercial shipping in the vital Red Sea corridor, though the group has not yet claimed responsibility for this specific incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and to restrict social media access until age 16 to promote better mental health outcomes. To prepare for this, she recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key preparatory steps include teaching children about online privacy, the value of their time away from screens, and establishing firm rules like no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge stresses that it is never too late for parents to set new boundaries, even with teens who already have devices.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rule is causing concern among transgender and non-binary travelers by requiring airlines to disregard 'X' gender markers on passports and input either 'M' or 'F'. While 'X' marker passports remain legally valid for travel, the policy creates ambiguity and potential for discrimination at the border, as airline-submitted data will not match the document. Legal experts and affected individuals report a lack of clarity from federal agencies on how the rule will be enforced, fearing it could lead to invasive searches, travel disruptions, and increased harassment for those with non-conforming documents.</p>

Buffett illustrated his point by explaining that all the world's gold would fit into a 68-foot cube that just sits there, unlike a company or farmland that actively delivers output and earnings.

          <p>A growing number of Gen Z women in the United States are identifying as "leftist" rather than liberal, signaling a significant political shift within the demographic. This trend is driven by a belief that the Democratic party is too centrist and has failed to address urgent issues like economic inequality, reproductive rights, and healthcare. Many young women feel their material conditions and personal safety are directly at stake, leading them to see moderation as a form of surrender. This leftward drift among women contrasts with Gen Z men, whose political views are more aligned with the national average.</p>

          <h2>Pew Research Finds Two-Thirds of Divorced Americans Eventually Remarry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center reveals that remarriage is a common outcome for divorced Americans, with about two-thirds choosing to marry again. The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarried households report a median net worth comparable to those in their first marriage, and significantly higher than divorced, single adults. Experts note that individuals entering a second marriage often do so with more foresight, frequently seeking prenuptial agreements. However, they also caution that second marriages have a higher rate of divorce compared to first marriages.</p>

          <h2>The Case for Embracing the 'Cringe' of Political Idealism in the Trump Era</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analytical article argues that the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, often dismissed as performative or "cringe," derives its strength from its earnest and idealistic belief in American democracy. This sincerity serves as a powerful contrast to the nihilism and irony of the MAGA movement. While critics mock the aesthetics of the protests, the underlying civic engagement has led to tangible political victories, such as the 2018 midterm "blue wave." As the "No Kings" protests resume, the article suggests that this unironic, and sometimes uncool, idealism is a necessary tool for countering authoritarian tendencies and rebuilding a sense of political possibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump has described the idea of a rail tunnel connecting Russia and the United States under the Bering Strait as "interesting." The comment came in response to a reporter's question during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who expressed his disapproval of the concept. The proposal was floated by Russia's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who claimed a feasibility study began six months ago and suggested Elon Musk's Boring Company could potentially construct the 70-mile tunnel. The project is envisioned as a symbolic link between the Americas and Afro-Eurasia.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has officially announced that the country is no longer bound by the restrictions imposed on its nuclear program by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The statement was issued as the landmark agreement, which capped Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, formally expired ten years after its adoption by the UN Security Council. The deal has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018, and recent moves by European powers to reinstate international sanctions have further eroded the agreement, with Tehran seeing no reason to continue negotiations.</p>

          <p>Millions of demonstrators are expected to participate in the second major wave of "No Kings" protests across the United States on Saturday, opposing the policies of President Trump. Organizers, a network of progressive groups, accuse the president of authoritarian behavior and cite escalating concerns over immigration raids, environmental deregulation, and attacks on democratic norms. The first protests in June drew an estimated five million people, and organizers anticipate an even larger turnout for this event. In response, some Republican leaders have condemned the marches as un-American, and several states have mobilized their National Guards.</p>

          <p>Native tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their fight to reclaim water and land rights from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP), which has extracted groundwater from the region for decades.

While the DWP maintains it manages the groundwater sustainably, the tribes assert that the city has created a "man-made drought" and are seeking to restore the valley they call Payahuunadü, "the land of flowing water."</p>
