          <p>President Trump publicly rebuked Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, suggesting he should replace the bank's economist or focus on his DJing hobby. The criticism followed a report from Goldman's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, which predicted that American consumers would increasingly bear the financial burden of the administration's tariffs. Trump asserted that the tariffs are primarily paid by foreign entities and are generating substantial revenue for the U.S. Treasury without causing inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, President Trump and Vice President Vance held a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about Russia's commitment to peace, noting that despite some signals of a desire to end the war, Russian forces continue to make significant advances on the front line. U.S. officials are framing the upcoming summit in Alaska as a preliminary discussion, while Zelenskyy warns that Putin may be preparing for new offensives rather than a genuine ceasefire.</p>

While the project is a landmark for clean energy and regional development for China, it has sparked significant anxiety in downstream countries like India and Bangladesh over water security. The author argues that this situation presents China with a crucial opportunity to build confidence and establish a framework for transboundary water diplomacy in a region where water politics are increasingly contentious.</p>

          <p>The White House issued a defiant "Bring it on, Gavin" in response to California Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to sue the Trump administration over a freeze on federal grants to UCLA. The administration has halted more than half a billion dollars in research funding, demanding sweeping changes at the university related to federal findings on antisemitism, affirmative action, and other campus policies. The escalating conflict pits the federal government against the nation's premier public university system.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Michigan has awarded nearly $60 million to a man who successfully sued a disgraced former prosecutor and a police officer for violating his rights. The plaintiff, Sean MacMaster, was charged with sexual abuse in a case that was later dismissed by the state's attorney general. The lawsuit argued that the prosecutor, Brian Kolodziej, pursued the false charges with malice in an effort to get close to a relative of MacMaster's ex-wife.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has confirmed that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering revoking the emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children between 6 months and 4 years old. The potential move is not related to the shot's safety or efficacy but appears to be part of a broader shift in immunization policy under the new leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services. This action could leave many young children without an available vaccine against the virus.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), economist E. J. Antoni, has recently advocated for suspending the agency's traditional monthly jobs report. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, questioned the accuracy of the key economic indicator, which aligns with the president's own claims that the data has been "rigged." This nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous BLS commissioner after a downward revision of job growth numbers.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old college graduate, Alyssa Jeacoma, went viral on TikTok after discovering that some of her private student loans carried a 17% interest rate, a detail she was unaware of when she signed for them at age 17.

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly rewritten and downscaled the U.S. State Department's annual global human rights report, a document previously seen as a comprehensive standard. The new version dramatically reduces criticism of some U.S. allies, such as Israel and El Salvador, while entirely eliminating sections that covered issues like government corruption and the persecution of LGBTQ+ individuals. Critics argue the changes signal an abandonment of core U.S. values and give a free pass to abusive governments.</p>
