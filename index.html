          <p>Gold prices experienced a significant rally, reaching over $3,500 an ounce, driven by investor concerns regarding President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence. Trump's public pressure on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and demands for lower interest rates have shaken market confidence, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets like gold. Central banks' increasing gold reserves and the ongoing trade war have also contributed to the precious metal's strong performance this year, with analysts predicting further upside potential.

          <p>President Trump appointed Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson, and Jon Voight as "special ambassadors" to Hollywood at the start of the year, however their exact roles and activities remain unclear. Efforts to contact the ambassadors by organizations seeking to boost local film and TV production have been unsuccessful, raising concerns that their appointments are merely symbolic. The U.S. film and TV industry faces challenges including the pandemic, labor strikes, and competition from other states and countries offering incentives.</p>

          <h2>Firing Fed Chair Would Be Self-Defeating, Analyst Argues</h2>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the possibility of his removal could destabilize financial markets. Firing Powell could lead to a market downturn, dollar depreciation, and increased long-term borrowing costs. Even with a replacement, securing desired interest rate cuts would require replacing the entire Fed board, potentially triggering further market chaos. The pressure on the Fed chair is seen as a self-defeating performance that undermines the central bank's credibility.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has proposed a sweeping reorganization of the US State Department, aiming to streamline the department amid criticism from the Trump White House. The plan could cut over 700 positions and eliminate 132 offices, with a potential 15% reduction in personnel. Rubio stated the reorganization targets departments involved in promoting democracy and human rights, claiming they have become beholden to radical political ideology. The reorganization may also include closing overseas missions and minimizing offices focused on promoting liberal values.</p>

          <p>Container vessel traffic from China to the busiest U.S. ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, has experienced a significant drop, indicating a pullback in trade between the two countries. The decline is attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and fears of a recession. The number of freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports decreased by 29% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year. The slowdown in ocean freight is impacting ground transport linked to the ports.</p>
