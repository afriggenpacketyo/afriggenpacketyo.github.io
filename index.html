          <p>A car ramming attack at the annual Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver, celebrating Filipino culture, resulted in the deaths of 11 people and injuries to dozens more, leaving the community in shock and mourning. A 30-year-old suspect with a history of mental health issues has been taken into custody, with investigators stating that terrorism is not suspected as a motive. The victims' ages range from five to 65, and the incident has been described as the "darkest day" in the city's history by acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai. The festival, which commemorates a Filipino national hero, was attended by tens of thousands of people. </p>

          <p>Canada is preparing for a snap federal election on April 28th after Prime Minister Mark Carney called for an early vote amid rising tensions with the US over trade tariffs. The election will see Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, face off against Pierre Poilievre of the Conservative Party and Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party. The Liberals, who have been in power since 2015, are currently polling slightly ahead of the Conservatives after trailing for several years. Key issues in the election include the cost of living, the economy, and the housing affordability crisis.</p>

          <p>Canada's upcoming federal election features a tight race between Liberal leader Mark Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, with the election being the first in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot. Carney, a former central banker, is politically untested but has taken a strong stance against US President Donald Trump. Poilievre, known for his confrontational style, advocates for a low-tax, small government approach. The Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, and the New Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, are also key players in the election.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter witnessed repeated violations of a ceasefire by Myanmar's ruling junta in Karenni state, despite an agreement following a 7.7-magnitude earthquake. The violations included rocket and mortar attacks that resulted in civilian casualties, including the death of a father of one. The reporter met with resistance fighters who described the ceasefire as a "joke" and detailed daily attacks by the junta, including air strikes. The UN has reported that the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, exacerbating an already dire situation due to the ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>Tyler Glasnow, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, exited Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the second inning due to right-shoulder discomfort.

By analyzing decades of recordings of dolphin sounds, the project aims to identify patterns and potential meanings behind their vocalizations.

Google plans to release DolphinGemma as an open model, hoping to establish a shared vocabulary with dolphins for interactive communication in the future.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers addressed several needs in the NFL draft, focusing on adding firepower to their offense with picks like running back Omarion Hampton and receivers Tre Harris and KeAndre Lambert-Smith. However, the offensive line remains a potential area of concern, as the team only drafted one rookie prospect, Branson Taylor. General manager Joe Hortiz expressed confidence in the existing roster and the competition for positions, leaving the door open for further offseason transactions.
