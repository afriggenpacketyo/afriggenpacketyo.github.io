            <p>An American pastor, Josh Sullivan, who was kidnapped during a church service in South Africa, was rescued following a "high-intensity shoot-out" with the kidnappers. The incident occurred in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape, where Sullivan was found unharmed. Authorities suspect the kidnappers were familiar with the family's movements. The rescue comes amidst a significant increase in kidnappings in South Africa over the past decade, according to police statistics.</p>

            <p>ASML, a major semiconductor equipment manufacturer, reported lower-than-expected net bookings, causing its shares to drop. CEO Christophe Fouquet noted that despite a strong demand outlook driven by AI, uncertainty stemming from potential U.S. trade restrictions could impact revenue. Fouquet emphasized that tariffs are creating uncertainty at a macroeconomic level and with respect to market demands. Analysts suggest that potential impacts from U.S. tariffs on ASML could be widespread, but the full effect remains unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

While U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated openness to a trade deal, he insists that China must initiate the first move. Li Chenggang has worked for China's commerce department since 2010 and served as China's representative to the World Trade Organization and several other international organizations.</p>

The area, known as the Roosevelt Reservation, will be tested for military control in New Mexico, with troops erecting fences and warning signs.

            <p>President Trump's threats of tariffs have plunged the U.S. into trade wars, creating uncertainty for businesses and economies worldwide. During his first term, Trump initiated a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on most of its products, which prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing. The timeline includes tariff threats against Canada and Mexico, the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports, and retaliatory measures from various countries. Some economists warn of significant consequences for businesses and consumers due to Trump's broad tariffs and the resulting retaliations.</p>

            <p>Rhian Mannings and Andrea Evans share a close friendship forged from a deeply tragic event: the death of Rhian's one-year-old son, George, from pneumonia, where Andrea, a nurse, was the last person to hold him. After George's death and the subsequent suicide of Rhian's husband, Paul, Rhian reached out to Andrea, leading to an enduring bond. Together, they've raised awareness about the emotional toll of child loss on both families and professionals. Rhian established the charity 2Wish to support families facing sudden child loss, while Andrea advocates for mental health support for professionals.</p>

            <p>Experts suggest that electricity infrastructure and utility costs are undergoing structural changes due to AI-driven demand for data centers. Without reform, U.S. consumers could face higher utility bills as costs shift to them. In the U.K., proposed electricity market reforms favoring data centers using renewable energy may lead to higher wholesale prices for residents. Regulation and energy grid reform are crucial for managing energy prices and meeting evolving energy needs.</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being threatened by intense grass fires. Endangered species like hen harriers and water voles are being pushed closer to extinction due to habitat destruction. The National Trust believes recent wildfires have destroyed the last remaining local breeding habitat for golden plovers. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures are contributing to the increase in fires, raising concerns about the long-term impact on wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Rafael Behr argues that under Donald Trump, 'defending free speech' equates to submission to the president's personal prejudices and commercial interests. He contends that any regulation impeding the operation of U.S. digital behemoths is treated as a hostile act, masking an imperial demand for market access. The author criticizes the administration's approach to media independence, judicial integrity, and democratic alliances, questioning whether Britain should align with such values in pursuit of a trade deal.</p>

These agreements allegedly forced manufacturers to exclude rival search services as a condition of advertising revenue sharing.
