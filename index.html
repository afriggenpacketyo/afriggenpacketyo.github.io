        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A gunman who killed four people, including a police officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building was reportedly targeting the NFL offices located there. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated the shooter, Shane Tamura, took the wrong elevator and carried out the attack at a different company. Investigators found a note in which Tamura referenced the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his perceived injuries. The incident has prompted the NFL to ask its New York employees to work from home amid an ongoing investigation into the gunman's background and motives.</p>

          <p>Two British brothers, aged 11 and 13, have tragically drowned after getting into difficulty in rough seas off a beach in Salou, Spain. Local authorities reported that the incident occurred on Tuesday evening while a yellow flag, advising caution, was in place due to the sea conditions. The boys' father also entered the water but was rescued alive. This event brings the total number of drowning fatalities on Catalan beaches this summer to 16, prompting officials to urge extreme precaution in the water.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is expressing increasing concern over Apple's lack of a clear artificial intelligence strategy, especially as competitors like Google and OpenAI make aggressive moves in the space. The company's stock has underperformed this year, and analysts worry that the delay of its next-generation Siri and the absence of groundbreaking AI features could eventually impact iPhone sales. While Apple's strong ecosystem and user loyalty provide a temporary buffer, the pressure is mounting for the tech giant to articulate a compelling vision for its role in the future of AI.</p>

          <p>During a broadcast of a Philadelphia Phillies game, commentator John Kruk made a subtle but critical remark about Chicago Sky player Angel Reese's rebounding style. While his co-broadcaster was discussing a friend who was a good rebounder, Kruk interjected, "There’s someone here in Chicago that does that a lot," alluding to criticism that Reese often rebounds her own misses. Reese later responded on social media, seemingly referencing the viral comments by posting about the desire for "clout." The WNBA star has previously turned similar criticism into a marketing opportunity by trademarking the term "Mebounds."</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has described the American "Dove" satellite constellation, operated by Planet Labs, as a collection of "low-cost orbital landmines." The critique focuses on the large fleet of small, thruster-less Earth-imaging satellites, arguing they pose a growing threat to the safety of operations in low Earth orbit. The researchers claim that a significant number of the satellites have deorbited in an uncontrolled manner and that many others have incorrect or fabricated identification codes in public databases, raising concerns about potential collisions and space debris.</p>

This charge, a response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, pushed the company into a pre-tax loss for the first half of the year. The company also reported a slowdown in sales, particularly among first-time buyers who are facing affordability constraints due to higher interest rates.

          <p>Although the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting, the event is filled with intrigue due to several underlying factors. Two Fed governors have publicly advocated for a rate cut, setting the stage for potential dissents on the policy decision. The meeting also occurs amid White House criticism of the Fed and pressure from President Trump for significant policy easing. While officials are likely to hold the rate steady, Chair Jerome Powell will face questions about these political pressures and the economic data justifying the delay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts man has been sentenced to time served after being imprisoned for over two years for a violent incident aboard a United Airlines flight in 2023. Francisco Severo Torres was accused of attempting to open an emergency exit door mid-flight from Los Angeles to Boston. When confronted, he attacked a flight attendant with a broken metal spoon, striking him in the neck three times before being subdued by crew and passengers. In addition to his time in custody, Torres will serve five years of supervised release, during which he is banned from commercial air travel.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump signaled that Ukrainian refugees who fled to the United States after Russia's full-scale invasion will likely be allowed to stay until the war ends. This statement provides some clarity on the status of approximately 240,000 Ukrainians whose residency was cast into doubt by earlier administration moves to terminate parole programs. The article also notes a recent successful raid by Ukrainian special forces on a Russian-occupied position on the Tendra Spit in the Black Sea, where they reportedly destroyed a radar station and raised the Ukrainian flag.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a crucial match against the British and Irish Lions, the state of rugby union in Australia is a major topic of discussion, with many acknowledging its struggle for attention against the more dominant sports of rugby league and Australian Rules Football (AFL). Experts and former players note that while the talent pool is strong, the sport suffers from inconsistency and a "fair weather" fan base. Some argue that if the top athletic talent weren't drawn to the NRL and AFL, the Australian national rugby team, the Wallabies, would be a dominant global force, highlighting the sport's challenges.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved a draft budget for 2026 that signals a significant shift away from its long-held tradition of fiscal conservatism. The budget outlines €520.5 billion in spending and new borrowing of approximately €174 billion, with major investments planned for infrastructure modernization, economic revival, and defense. While the cabinet has approved the plan, the Finance Minister warned that significant austerity measures may be necessary starting in 2027. The budget now moves to German lawmakers for debate and is expected to be finalized by year's end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German sportswear company Adidas announced that it expects U.S. tariffs to cost the company up to €200 million in the second half of the year, confirming that prices will likely rise for American consumers. The company's stock fell sharply following the news, as most of its production occurs in Asian countries recently affected by new U.S. import levies. CEO Bjørn Gulden stated that while the company will try to manage the impact, the tariffs make business difficult and create uncertainty about consumer demand if they lead to broader inflation.

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state by September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza and halt West Bank annexation. This follows a similar announcement from France and comes as a group of 15 countries issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to a two-state solution. Israel and the U.S. have criticized the move, with an Israeli official calling it a "reward for Hamas," a claim rejected by the UK government which insists the focus is on the Palestinian people and achieving a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <h2>An Examination of a 1930s Fascist's Arguments Reveals Parallels in Modern Critiques of Liberalism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A political analysis explores the work of Lawrence Dennis, an intellectual who advocated for fascism in America during the 1930s, to draw parallels with contemporary right-wing critiques of liberalism. The article identifies two "anti-liberal traps" in Dennis's thinking that are echoed today: the tendency to declare liberalism's doom based on recent crises, and the idealization of illiberal alternatives while downplaying their dangers. By showing how Dennis's predictions of liberalism's collapse were proven wrong, the analysis serves as a cautionary tale against accepting similar arguments from modern anti-liberal thinkers.</p>
