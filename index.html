          <p>Annabel Rook, a 46-year-old charity worker who co-founded Mama Suze CIC to support refugee and migrant women, was found fatally stabbed at her home in Stoke Newington, north London, following a gas explosion. A 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to the hospital with slash wounds. The Met Police believe the incident was domestic-related, and two children were taken to the hospital as a precaution. Neighbors reported hearing a massive bang and screams, describing the event as a tragedy for the street, while colleagues remember Rook as a lively and enthusiastic person dedicated to improving the lives of trafficked women.</p>

The probability of a recession in the next year has decreased to 38%, but remains above January levels, while GDP is expected to grow by 1.13%. A majority of respondents expect the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China within about five months.

          <p>A recent poll by the Ronald Reagan Institute reveals that 84% of Americans believe preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is crucial for U.S. security and prosperity. The survey was conducted before Israel's attack on Iran, which included strikes on nuclear facilities and military leaders, leading to a series of retaliatory actions. The poll also indicated a partisan divide, with 6 in 10 Republicans supporting Israeli airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities if diplomatic efforts fail, compared to lower support among independents and Democrats.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that he is an "easy target" and demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender" amidst escalating tensions with Israel. Trump claimed "total control" over Iran's airspace and warned against missiles being fired at civilians or American soldiers. The U.S. president's threat came after reports that he had vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate the ayatollah. The tensions led to a slide in U.S. stocks and a jump in crude oil futures, with the Pentagon deploying additional warships to the Middle East.</p>

Experts argue that the U.S. lacks the necessary local manufacturing capabilities for smartphone production.

While an agreement to reduce tariffs on UK car exports and eliminate them for the aerospace sector was reached, steel tariffs remain a point of contention. The Trump administration is seeking assurances about Tata Steel's transition to electric arc furnaces and the origin of raw materials, as US import rules require steel to be "melted and poured" in the country of origin.

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, have requested the Supreme Court to swiftly consider their challenge to President Trump's tariffs, citing the significant impact on businesses and consumers. They argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose such tariffs. The companies are seeking a decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighs in, suggesting arguments be heard in September or October. This lawsuit is separate from another challenge filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, which was initially blocked but later reinstated pending appeal.</p>

          <p>The NBA's emphasis on parity, driven by a new collective-bargaining agreement, has led to a shift away from super-teams and towards more balanced rosters, potentially impacting television ratings. The agreement makes it more difficult for teams to load up on multiple superstars due to spending limits and luxury taxes. Teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers have constructed championship-caliber teams by trading star players for assets that reshape their rosters. The rise of international talent has also contributed to parity, making it harder for any one franchise to consistently dominate.</p>
