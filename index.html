          <p>The parents of a teenager who died in a devastating Texas flash flood successfully advocated for new campground safety laws. The legislation, prompted by the death of their daughter and more than two dozen others at Camp Mystic, will prohibit cabins in flood zones and mandate better warning and communication systems. The parents hope these changes prevent future tragedies and serve as a model for other states, addressing what they describe as complacency in the old rules that contributed to the preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>A spokeswoman has confirmed that former President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery to address skin cancer. This procedure involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains, a technique considered highly effective for common skin cancers like basal cell carcinoma. This follows a previous procedure in 2023 where a cancerous lesion was removed from his chest, and is separate from his earlier diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>In the New York City mayoral race, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo challenged his opponent, Zohran Mamdani, to a series of debates across all five boroughs. Mamdani countered by proposing he debate Donald Trump directly, labeling Cuomo as Trump's "puppet." This exchange occurs amid speculation that Trump's allies are attempting to clear the field for Cuomo by offering administration jobs to other candidates, including incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, to consolidate the anti-Mamdani vote.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law. The lawsuit, part of the Trump administration's broader effort to challenge sanctuary cities, specifically targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Boston's policies undermine law enforcement and protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, endangering public safety.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has permitted the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in Florida to remain open, overturning a lower court's shutdown order. The 2-1 ruling allows construction and operation to continue while a lawsuit from environmental groups proceeds. The court determined that since the facility has not yet used federal funds, it is not subject to federal environmental reviews, a decision welcomed by state officials but decried by opponents as a blow to the Everglades.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Sir John Curtice examines the significant rise of the Reform UK party, which has been leading in polls for five months. The party's success is attributed to its ability to attract dissatisfied voters, particularly those who supported Brexit and hold socially conservative views on issues like immigration and climate change. Led by Nigel Farage, Reform has capitalized on a fragmented political landscape, but its long-term success will depend on sustaining this momentum and potentially broadening its appeal.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie has been discovered among his personal archives, which are being donated to the V&A Museum. The project was an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," for which Bowie had compiled extensive notes on London society, crime, and satire from that era. These notes, found locked in his private study after his death, reveal his ambition to write for the theatre and offer new insights into his creative process during his final months.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new ordinance that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees. The proposal follows a similar law recently enacted for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the growing public health risks of extreme heat. Proponents argue it is a critical health measure, especially for vulnerable populations, while landlord associations have raised concerns about the potential costs for building upgrades and higher utility bills for tenants.</p>

These digital assets combine the efficiency of cryptocurrency with the stability of traditional money, reinforcing the dollar's dominance in the digital finance realm.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and permit the removal of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. This request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing statutory tenure protections designed to ensure the independence of regulatory agencies. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields substantial executive power, and therefore its commissioners should serve at the will of the president, challenging a long-standing legal precedent.</p>
