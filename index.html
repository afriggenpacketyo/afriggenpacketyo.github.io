The plan would incentivize charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) by offering donors dollar-for-dollar tax credits. Public school advocates criticize the proposal, arguing it would weaken public education by diverting crucial funding to private institutions with less accountability. The proposal also raises concerns about the rights of students with disabilities in private schools.</p>

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a personal loan. The average HELOC interest rate is 7.99%, while the average personal loan rate is 12.47%. HELOCs are secured by the home, resulting in lower rates, and are likely to decrease further due to anticipated rate cuts. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, but should carefully calculate repayments to ensure long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Capital One, accusing the bank of "cheating" customers out of millions of dollars in interest payments by failing to inform them about a new savings product with higher interest rates. The lawsuit mimics a similar case by the CFPB that was dropped earlier this year. James alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as a high-yield savings account, then failed to inform customers about its new "360 Performance Savings" product that offered substantially higher interest rates.</p>
