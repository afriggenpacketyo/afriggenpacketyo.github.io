Sources indicate the couple is "happier than ever" and actively planning for their future, with de Ramon consistently accompanying Pitt on his film promotional tours, including their first public appearance at the 2024 British Grand Prix. She also provided substantial emotional support to Pitt following the loss of his mother, Jane Etta Pittt, in August, demonstrating a deep bond. The article highlights their evolving relationship, which began in 2022 after Pitt's divorce from Angelina Jolie, and their recent move into a new house.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Luke Littler secured a spot in the World Grand Prix Darts semi-finals by defeating Gerwyn Price in a dramatic quarter-final match held in Leicester. The reigning world champion overcame a two-set deficit against the 2020 World Grand Prix winner, delivering a sensational 152 checkout in the deciding leg to clinch the victory. Price, who missed three match darts in the fourth set, graciously applauded Littler's impressive comeback. Littler expressed his strategy of switching to double 16s, a key finish that previously helped him win the World Championship, proving crucial once again.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intention to implement 100% tariffs on imports from China starting November 1, in addition to existing duties, citing China's "extraordinarily aggressive position on trade." This move comes in response to China's new large-scale export controls on virtually every product they make, including critical rare-earth minerals essential for semiconductors and defense. Trump also threatened to impose export controls on "any and all critical software" and suggested canceling an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at APEC, triggering a stock market sell-off across major indices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with AstraZeneca, a U.K.-based pharmaceutical giant, to significantly lower drug prices in the United States. Under this deal, AstraZeneca will sell its primary care medications directly to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed countries, known as "most-favored nation" pricing, via a new government website, TrumpRx.gov. In return, the company will be exempt from pharmaceutical sector tariffs, contingent on its commitment to invest $50 billion in U.S. manufacturing by 2030. This initiative follows a similar pact with Pfizer, as the administration continues to pressure drugmakers to reduce sky-high costs for medicines.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the nation is signaling a strategic shift towards attracting "high-quality" foreign investment, moving away from a previous emphasis on sheer quantity. Local officials are now explicitly seeking projects in strategic sectors such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and artificial intelligence, particularly in prosperous regions like the Yangtze River Delta. This new approach aims to help complete and develop local supply chains and enhance China's technological and industrial capabilities. The change indicates a more selective and targeted engagement with foreign capital, reflecting high-level policy priorities for future development.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, just four days after Lecornu's initial resignation, aiming to resolve days of political turmoil. Lecornu faces the immense challenge of forming a government and presenting next year's budget by Monday, despite Macron lacking a parliamentary majority and his popularity hitting a record low of 14%. Political divisions over France's national debt, which stands at almost 114% of GDP, and budget deficits have contributed to the fall of two previous prime ministers. Lecornu has been granted "carte blanche" but faces immediate opposition from both far-right and far-left parties, with a likely vote of no confidence.</p>

The administration's attempts to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal human smuggling charges are pending have been challenged, with lawyers citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision against "indefinite detention."

          <h2>Experts Skeptical of Mortgage Fraud Case Against New York Attorney General Letitia James</h2>

          <p>Legal experts are expressing deep skepticism about the mortgage fraud indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James, suggesting a conviction will be an uphill battle. Career prosecutors had previously found no probable cause for the charges, which allege James lied on mortgage documents to secure a better rate for a second home she later rented out. Experts point to ambiguities in the mortgage rider, which does not explicitly prohibit rentals, and the unusually low alleged financial benefit of $633 per year, as weaknesses in the case. James has denied the charges, calling them "baseless" and politically motivated, especially given President Trump's public calls for her indictment.</p>

          <h2>China Imposes Retaliatory Port Fees on American Ships Amid Escalating Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>China has introduced tit-for-tat port fees on U.S.-owned vessels docking in its ports, directly retaliating against planned American port fees on Chinese ships. The new fees, effective October 14, will apply to vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, or flying the U.S. flag, and will increase annually until 2028. China's Ministry of Transport condemned the U.S. fees as "discriminatory" and damaging to international trade, asserting they undermine economic order. This measure expands a series of retaliatory actions by Beijing, including new export curbs on rare earths, ahead of a potential meeting between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

          <p>Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend is vigorously defending his new, controversial consultancy role with Red Bull, asserting it will ultimately benefit his coaching for the national team. Despite criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest and distraction from his primary duties, Townsend maintains he is "all-in" with Scotland Rugby and will prioritize national team commitments. He argues the maximum 30-day consultancy provides invaluable access to world-leading sports organizations like Formula One and football, enhancing his development as a coach and, by extension, the team's performance. Townsend believes this unique learning opportunity will strengthen Scotland, which he claims is currently in its best position.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an agreement to establish a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This new facility will enable Qatari F-15 pilots to train alongside American military personnel, aiming to enhance combined training, increase lethality, and improve interoperability between the two nations. The agreement signifies a deepening relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar, following previous diplomatic developments. These include the president's executive order "assuring the security of the state of Qatar" and the acceptance of a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the Qatari government, despite some criticism.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant sell-off after President Donald Trump threatened a "massive" tariff increase on China, citing a dispute over rare earth minerals. This unexpected escalation, despite recent improvements in trade relations, caused the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow to drop sharply. The article also marks the three-year anniversary of the current bull market, highlighting top performers like Nvidia and Broadcom, which soared over 1,500% and 665% respectively, alongside underperformers such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Nike. Investors are advised not to overreact to presidential social media posts, awaiting concrete policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tesla's New Affordable Models Criticized for Stripped-Down Features and High Pricing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 16:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has launched new, supposedly more affordable Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard vehicles, but they are drawing criticism for being heavily pared-down versions of their best-sellers. Features like AM/FM radio, premium sound systems, and "vegan leather" seats have been removed, while the price savings are minimal, only $5,000 less than premium versions. Critics argue these models fall significantly short of Elon Musk's earlier promise for a $25,000 electric car, suggesting Musk's focus on AI and his political ties are affecting the company's direction and sales. Competitors are now offering more feature-rich EVs at similar or lower price points, intensifying market pressure.</p>
