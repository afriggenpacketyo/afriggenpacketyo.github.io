            <p>A Florida man, Jeffrey O. Kennerk, was indicted in New Jersey after allegedly bringing a "small arsenal" of weapons and ammunition onto an Amtrak train. Transit police discovered an unattended bag containing a handgun, AR-style rifle, and ammunition at Penn Station in Newark. After reviewing camera footage, they identified Kennerk, who was boarding a train bound for Virginia. He was arrested in Trenton before boarding his ticketed train, and a search of his second suitcase revealed more weapons and ammunition, averting potential carnage, according to officials.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece warns that the United States is at risk of becoming an authoritarian state similar to Russia under Vladimir Putin. The author, Garry Kasparov, argues that the Trump administration is weakening democratic institutions and centralizing power. He urges the American opposition to focus on defending democratic processes and institutions rather than solely criticizing specific policies. Kasparov emphasizes the importance of resisting attacks on due process and the rule of law to prevent the erosion of American democracy.</p>

            <p>A conservative movement is gaining momentum to remake American day care by prioritizing less expensive home-based programs, de-emphasizing professional credentials, and backing more mothers staying home. This approach is driven by the belief that deregulation will solve the child care crisis, contrasting with the view that more public investment is needed. The debate highlights the tension between expanded government support and deregulation as solutions to America's child care challenges. The death of a baby in an Idaho day care that violated existing staff-to-child ratios has fueled the debate.</p>

            <p>Two small studies suggest that stem cell transplants could offer a new treatment option for Parkinson's disease. Researchers found that stem cells transplanted into the brains of Parkinson's patients began producing dopamine and appeared to ease symptoms like tremor. One study used stem cells derived from human embryos, while the other used induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient's own cells. The FDA has cleared one of the stem cell treatments for a phase 3 study, the last hurdle before approval.</p>

            <p>A new image on Chinese social media suggests that China's military has added the sophisticated KJ-700 radar plane to its naval capability. This medium-sized airborne early warning and control aircraft is believed to significantly upgrade the People’s Liberation Army’s ability to detect stealth aircraft and missiles. Based on a Y-9 platform, the KJ-700 combines airborne radar with electro-optical and infrared sensors, potentially tracking targets across air, sea, and land domains. The aircraft's light grey paintwork suggests it has formally entered service in the naval branch’s air wing.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule change that would significantly limit the Endangered Species Act's power to preserve crucial habitats. The proposed change would prohibit only actions that directly hurt or kill actual animals, not the habitats they rely on. Conservation experts argue that habitat loss is the biggest single cause of extinction and that the proposed change would reverse conservation gains. The public has 30 days to comment on the proposed rule change, which is also likely to be challenged in court.</p>

            <p>Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, which enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions, could face budget challenges if the federal government cuts Medicaid funding. These states would have limited options to scale back their programs, as any changes would require a constitutional amendment. Republicans in Congress are considering cutting the federal share of Medicaid funding, potentially leaving these states with significant budget holes. Some opponents of Medicaid expansion are reconsidering their positions in light of these potential cuts.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs estimates that US$370 billion in Chinese firms’ American depositary receipts (ADRs) are at risk if the US severs market ties. The report indicates that US individuals are more likely than institutional investors to sell ADRs of Chinese companies if the Trump administration pursues a decoupling of the world’s two biggest stock markets. Companies with high retail exposure, such as Alibaba Group Holding, would be more susceptible to sell-offs if they are forced to delist. (not investment advice)</p>
