          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the commitment to publish it later this year, possibly in the autumn alongside the Budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce is still working on the strategy, considering measures like scrapping the two-child benefit cap. While some criticize the delay, others suggest it allows for a more substantial strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship. The government highlights existing efforts to combat child poverty, such as expanding free breakfast clubs and increasing the minimum wage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students after Harvard sued, alleging First Amendment violations. The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a "critical step" to protect international students' rights. The dispute is part of a broader standoff between the administration and Harvard over campus policies, including actions on antisemitism and DEI.</p>

          <p>Federal prison officials visited Alcatraz to assess its structural integrity following Donald Trump's announcement of plans to rebuild and reopen the island prison. The facility has been closed since 1963 due to high operating costs and logistical challenges. While some officials express skepticism about the feasibility of reopening Alcatraz, citing financial and legal hurdles, others believe modern materials could solve the island's challenges. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is currently undertaking seismic retrofitting projects on the island to reinforce the pier and stabilize the cellhouse.</p>

The article suggests Russia is neutralizing potential threats and pressure points by playing for time, as evidenced by its response to European ultimatums and the Trump administration's approach to sanctions.

The Parole Board of the State of New Mexico granted her parole, which runs through May 2026, requiring her to adhere to conditions such as electronic monitoring and employment or school enrollment.

          <p>The Trump Department of Justice is moving to dissolve the Flores Consent Decree, which has governed the detention and release of migrant children since 1997, arguing it incentivizes illegal immigration.

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial elections, with hotly contested primaries, are seen as a potential bellwether for the national mood ahead of the 2026 midterms.

Key issues in the race include immigration enforcement, the cost of housing, and general affordability. The Democratic primary features six candidates, while Republicans hope to flip the governorship red, pointing to Trump's closer-than-expected margin in New Jersey in 2024.</p>

China is seeking to establish a permanent presence in the Arctic, while Russia controls a significant portion of the Arctic shoreline and has been increasing military cooperation with China. The article explores the rising tensions and potential for conflict in the Arctic amid growing global rivalries.</p>

          <p>Jon Worrell has been jailed on murder charges in connection with the 2006 death of his wife, Doris Worrell, nearly 19 years after fleeing the U.S. to live in Costa Rica with the couple's live-in nanny. Initially, Doris's death was believed to be a botched robbery, but suspicion later turned to Jon. The case was reopened after investigators traveled to Costa Rica and found the nanny willing to talk after her relationship with Worrell ended. Worrell was arrested at his home in Missouri and waived extradition to Georgia.</p>

          <p>This guest essay reflects on the life and legacy of Sarah Milgrim, an advocate for peace, who was murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum alongside her partner, Yaron Lischinsky. The author met Sarah on an interfaith trip to Morocco, where she was struck by Sarah's commitment to coexistence and the possibility of a different Middle East. Sarah worked with organizations that brought together people of different faiths and nationalities, and she believed in creating a space for people to look for solutions. The author urges against using Sarah's death for political gain and calls for remembering her as a symbol of hope.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, to deport him to El Salvador. This move has sparked accusations that the US president is trying to do a favor for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who allegedly struck a deal with the gang in 2019. Critics argue that deporting Arevalo-Chavez prevents him from testifying in a US court about Bukele's past ties to the gang. The justice department cites "sensitive and important foreign policy considerations" for dismissing the charges.</p>

Johnson was awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion that resulted in a man's death and a child's injury. The escape occurred when Johnson and another inmate opened the back door to the jail, and Johnson was helped over the perimeter fence. This incident follows a similar escape in May 2024, where Johnson was among four inmates who broke through the jail's perimeter fence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge overturned Donald Trump's executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed an attorney who investigated him. The executive order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings. Trump accused the firm of undermining justice and the interests of the United States, specifically criticizing their hiring of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge halted the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to block international students from attending Harvard University, granting a temporary restraining order. Harvard had sued the Trump administration, accusing it of a "campaign of retribution" and violating the university's First Amendment rights. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for records of protest activity. The lawsuit argued that stopping the flow of international students would destabilize the school, as they contribute significantly to the university and its mission.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel canceled his upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is diagnosed through imaging and spinal taps, and treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve symptoms, but the prognosis depends on the disease's stage and other health conditions.</p>
