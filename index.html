          <p>One hundred days into Donald Trump's return to the White House, US China policy is characterized by a chaotic mix of rhetoric, reaction, and risky escalation. Despite some friendly overtures, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese imports, accusing China of trying to "screw" the US, and his administration lacks a confirmed ambassador to Beijing. Vice-President Vance's comment referring to the Chinese people as “peasants” has sparked outrage and raised questions about the administration’s judgment. Without clear direction from the two presidents, any discussions between the countries lack direction and coherence.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian protester, Debora Rodrigues, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for writing on a statue with lipstick during pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations in 2023. She was convicted of involvement with a criminal organization with intent to launch a coup after attacking government buildings following Bolsonaro's loss in the 2022 election. Rodrigues wrote "You lost, idiot" on a statue outside the Supreme Federal Court and claimed she was unaware of the scale of the protests, leading to arguments by Bolsonaro supporters that they are victims of political persecution. Bolsonaro himself has called for amnesty for Rodrigues.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis questions the economic value of a college education, particularly as tuition costs rise and student loan debt burdens many Americans. While college graduates typically earn significantly more than those with only a high school diploma, a substantial portion of graduates see little return on their investment. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, extended time to graduation, and choice of major can significantly impact the financial payoff of a college degree. STEM majors tend to yield the highest returns, while fields like fine arts and education offer the lowest.</p>
