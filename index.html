          <p>Following clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators protesting federal immigration operations, the Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles. President Trump signed a memorandum to send 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived lawlessness resulting from the protests. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory and believes it will escalate tensions. The protests erupted after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, leading to arrests and further demonstrations, with activists planning additional mobilization.</p>

          <p>Charles M. Blow, a political analyst and former New York Times columnist, reflects on the current state of racial justice and the observance of Juneteenth. He notes that corporate sponsors have become hesitant to support Juneteenth-related activities, signaling a shift in the country's mood. Blow describes a "Great Blackout," characterized by the removal of Black history and symbols, such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C. He expresses concern that America's youngest national holiday is now caught in the crossfire of culture wars, with multiple cities canceling Juneteenth celebrations.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, has stated that Israel will prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip. Katz affirmed that Israel will not allow anyone to break its naval blockade, which it asserts is necessary to prevent Hamas from importing arms. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, operating the vessel, accuses Israel of jamming their communications as they approach Gaza. This action follows a previous attempt by the group to reach Gaza, which failed after their vessel was attacked by drones in international waters, with the organization blaming Israel for the incident.</p>

          <p>The government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures, including potential time limits for children's social media use, such as a two-hour cap and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle mentioned the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones, while online safety campaigner Ian Russell criticized the government for delaying new laws to protect children. Kyle stated that legislation passed in 2023 has yet to be enacted but will require platforms to supply age-appropriate material, or face criminal sanctions.</p>

          <p>The enduring popularity of William Shakespeare's plays is explored at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., which recently underwent an $80 million renovation. The library holds the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's First Folios, and experts like Maureen Dowd discuss the playwright's relevance to modern audiences. Actor Patrick Page also discusses how Shakespeare invented the villain in his one-man show, "All the Devils Are Here," illustrating the timelessness of Shakespeare's characters and themes. Ira Glass, who once tweeted that "Shakespeare sucks," admits that the plays are difficult to read but offer profound insights into human nature.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for relationship conflicts, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, signaled through a sour tone, is a significant predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs and misalignments. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication can also lead to conflict, with the psychologist offering strategies such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, and using a designated time-out signal to navigate these issues. The psychologist also suggests working together to redistribute tasks and trying to see eye-to-eye before airing grievances.</p>

Jobs was adept at identifying the core idea in a room where he had no prior knowledge, which enabled him to assist employees in solving problems. Docter also noted that Jobs had a habit of calling producers at any time, day or night, a practice he hopes to avoid himself.

          <p>A growing number of students and faculty at Pomona College are attempting to reduce the influence of technology on campus life, with efforts including calls for more tech-free classes and the formation of a "Luddite Club." Some professors are limiting or banning electronic devices in their classrooms, while students are opting for flip phones over smartphones. The pervasiveness of technology is seen as a threat to the close-knit community that small residential liberal-arts colleges strive to create. Despite these efforts, the college's leadership has not yet aligned itself with those advocating for reduced technology use.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, particularly among Republicans, but views are heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is strong when people believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but it drops if they think it targets a broader population. The poll also shows that more Americans believe the program makes the U.S. safer, but there are concerns about the economic impact and the potential for legal residents to be mistakenly deported. Americans are also divided on whether the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will help the middle class or increase the federal deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

It references Blake's quote about persisting in folly to become wise, and captures the experience of life having both exploding and birthing stars within it.
