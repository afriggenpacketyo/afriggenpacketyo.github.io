          <p>Emma Raducanu lost to Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, despite showing promise on the grass court. Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and Raducanu's back issues contributed to the defeat, although Raducanu initially gained a double break lead in the second set, Zheng rallied to win. The article suggests Raducanu can still perform well on grass but needs to bridge the gap to challenge top players consistently. Despite the loss, Raducanu can remain confident in her grass court abilities.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military leaders reflect a shift in strategy influenced by the October 7 Hamas attack. Israel's successful campaign against Hezbollah's leadership and rocket stores reduced wariness about launching a similar campaign against Iran. Diminished fear of diplomatic blowback, Trump's foreign-policy approach, and Netanyahu's political situation also contributed to the decision. The article argues that the consensus on Iran's threat to Israel is the primary factor behind the strikes.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song “Bye Bye,” titled “Bye Bye 25,” which incorporates terms the Trump administration has tried to minimize from public life. The song highlights the absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, avoiding the pitfalls of strident criticism that can backfire. Gordon's approach is deadpan and funny, presenting a jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on. The article connects this effort to Gordon's history of protest music and her observations on the current political climate.</p>
