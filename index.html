          <h2>England to Open Urgent Mental Health Centers Nationwide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 23:47:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS has announced plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients, referrals from GPs, and police, providing specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails this as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, citing concerns about funding and the complexity of separating physical and mental health issues, advocating for robust testing before national rollout. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people facing long waits in A&E, underscoring the urgent need for improved mental health services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition technology, operated by Project N.O.L.A., has sparked controversy during the search for 10 escaped inmates. While authorities claim the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, critics, including the ACLU and some Republicans, raise concerns about constitutional and privacy issues. The ACLU argues that live facial recognition poses a threat to individual rights and calls for an indefinite halt to the program. Project N.O.L.A. operates around 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates to assist in solving various crimes, but the lack of transparency and potential for racial bias raise significant ethical questions.</p>

          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, which has since been moved. Despite the aircraft continuously broadcasting its location via ADS-B, federal air traffic controllers had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's precise location, leading to confusion. This incident adds to concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near the airport, prompting the Army to pause flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety issues with the FAA.</p>

He argues that as the United States becomes more U.S.-centric, AI could become a bargaining chip, making it crucial for Japan to develop its own secure and efficient information systems and cybersecurity capabilities.

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestically-grown rice, while other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in affordable alternatives, as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has doubled compared to the previous year due to a poor harvest. This move aims to increase overall rice consumption by offering customers greater choice and affordability.</p>

Retailers have reported a surge in sales as customers buy up popular flavors, while ex-smokers like Baroness Claire Fox express concern that the ban will lead people back to cigarettes. The government aims to reduce environmental impact and deter youth vaping, but critics argue the ban overlooks public health benefits. A recent poll indicates that some vapers will either stockpile by buying abroad or revert to smoking, raising concerns about the ban's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Investigators are working to determine the cause of a San Diego plane crash that resulted in at least four fatalities and several injuries in the Murphy Canyon neighborhood. The crash involved a Cessna 550 private jet heading towards Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, with the plane striking power lines and colliding with a home. The NTSB is investigating technical issues at the airport, including an outage of a weather update system and runway lights, although it is unclear if these factors contributed to the crash. The plane did not have a flight data recorder, and the crash damaged multiple homes, displacing residents.</p>

          <p>All six people aboard a small plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood have been confirmed dead. The investigation is focusing on potential contributing factors, including foggy weather conditions and technical issues at the airport. Runway lights were out, and a weather alert system was not working at the time of the incident. The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions were not ideal and debated diverting to a different airport. The aircraft, a twin-engine Cessna Citation, crashed two miles from the airport after clipping power lines, igniting fires and damaging nearby homes.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit the construction of a 767-kilometer canal connecting the inland province of Jiangxi to the coastal province of Zhejiang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is part of a larger project aimed at linking Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water, with an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan. The canal is expected to facilitate the transport of resources and manufactured goods between the inland manufacturing hub and the coastal seaports, integrating less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. Once completed, the canal could handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dramatically curtailed press access inside the Pentagon, citing concerns about leaks of classified and unclassified information. The new restrictions limit reporters to a specific area and require escorts for movement elsewhere in the building. Hegseth claims the measures aim to limit leaks, but critics view them as punitive and an attack on the freedom of the press. The Pentagon has faced numerous leaks since Hegseth took over, leading to investigations and firings of top aides. The new restrictions are comparable to limited press access at the White House.</p>
