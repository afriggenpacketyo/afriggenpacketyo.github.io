          <p>Medics at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City are overwhelmed by casualties from Israeli strikes, forced to perform operations in unsanitary conditions with scarce anesthesia and painkillers. Australian volunteers describe daily mass casualty events, including saving a baby from a decapitated pregnant woman, as Israeli forces advance within 500 meters of the facility. The hospital, once the biggest in Gaza, is now heavily damaged, and other medical centers in the area have also been forced to shut down or evacuate. The article highlights the extreme challenges faced by healthcare workers and civilians trapped amidst the ongoing conflict, with many unable to flee south due to dangerous conditions and exorbitant costs, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office labeled President Trump's comments "bigoted" after Trump falsely claimed London seeks to implement sharia law and had "changed" under Khan's leadership. Trump's remarks, made at the UN General Assembly, echoed far-right conspiracy theories linking Khan, the city's first Muslim mayor, to Islamic fundamentalism, despite no evidence. British politicians, including members of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, defended Khan, emphasizing London's status as a diverse and safe global city. This incident reignites a long-standing feud between the two leaders, with Trump frequently criticizing Khan's tenure and London's crime rates, which have indeed seen an increase in overall recorded crime and violent crime over the past decade.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a groundbreaking scholar of Chinese law and a consistent critic of Beijing, has passed away at the age of 95. As professor emeritus at NYU School of Law and founder of its US-Asia Law Institute, Cohen profoundly influenced global discussions on China's legal system, trade, and human rights for over six decades. He was the first American to practice law in Communist China, and his writings on Chinese criminal procedure and China’s interactions with international law are considered foundational. Cohen was renowned for both advocating for Chinese dissidents and promoting continued engagement with the Chinese government, leaving a towering impact on the field.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's experimental oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, has demonstrated significant weight reduction and cardiometabolic improvements in phase 3 clinical trials. The drug, a potential alternative to injectable GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, showed participants on the highest dose losing an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks. It also normalized blood sugar levels in many pre-diabetic individuals and improved cardiovascular risk factors. While common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues, some experts express caution about potential unknown long-term consequences as it is not a peptide. Eli Lilly aims for FDA approval as early as 2026 for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. (not investment advice)</p>

Election experts and nonpartisan groups dismiss these theories as poorly constructed and financially motivated, similar to past "Big Lie" narratives. They emphasize that state-level audits are public and show no such discrepancies, and the disparities cited can be explained by mundane voter behavior.</p>

          <p>Major medical organizations are strongly rejecting President Trump's assertion that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism, calling his claims "highly concerning" and "irresponsible." Groups like ACOG and SMFM emphasize that decades of research show no direct cause-and-effect, and untreated fever and pain in pregnancy pose significant risks. Trump also suggested a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and proposed leucovorin as a treatment, both claims contradicted by extensive scientific evidence. Medical experts and autism advocacy groups urge reliance on established science and warn against promoting unfounded health claims that could endanger public health and create false hope.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump experienced a chaotic and at times incoherent day at the 80th United Nations General Assembly, upending US policy on the Russia-Ukraine war. His bizarre speech attacked other countries and climate change efforts, while being light on policy. Following meetings with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and French President Macron, Trump surprisingly stated that NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets violating airspace and that Ukraine should reclaim all its original territory. This marks a significant shift from his previous, more deferential stance towards Vladimir Putin, though the long-term implications of this unpredictable policy change remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent declaration that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" marks a significant reversal from his previous stance, which was often deferential to Russia. This shift occurred after his UN General Assembly speech and meetings with Ukrainian and French leaders. While Trump now portrays Russia as a "paper tiger" and suggests Ukraine can regain territory, the article questions the sincerity and actionable nature of this change. It speculates that Trump's unpredictability might stem from humiliation or a desire to distance himself from the conflict, rather than a genuine commitment to strengthening Ukraine's war effort.</p>

          <p>California's Senate Bill 576, awaiting the governor's signature, aims to prohibit streaming services like Hulu and Netflix from playing commercials louder than their programming. The legislation was spurred by a new mother's frustration over disruptive ad volumes waking her newborn, highlighting a widespread consumer annoyance. While existing federal law, the CALM Act, regulates broadcast and cable TV ads, it does not currently cover streaming services. The FCC is also reviewing its rules due to a recent surge in consumer complaints about loud streaming advertisements.

While China has long required individuals to pay tax on their foreign earnings, enforcement has historically been lax and discretionary.

          <p>Hundreds of federal employees, primarily from the General Services Administration (GSA), are being rehired after being laid off during Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative within the Trump administration. These employees, who managed government workspaces, are being reinstated after a seven-month paid leave, during which the GSA incurred high costs by failing to terminate leases as planned. Critics argue that the aggressive downsizing, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), left the agency understaffed and unable to perform basic functions, creating costly confusion rather than savings.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced that her administration has successfully averted all planned layoffs for city workers this year, despite facing a $1 billion budget shortfall. This achievement follows months of negotiations and agreements with city unions, including the Coalition of Los Angeles City Unions, whose members will take up to five unpaid holidays in 2026. Cost-cutting measures, such as scaling back hiring at the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Fire Department, contributed to saving approximately 1,000 jobs. The mayor emphasized the success as a testament to collective effort and solidarity, though acknowledged that the city's budget challenges are ongoing and require continued focus on long-term solutions and protecting the city workforce and services.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, intensified into a Category 4 major hurricane, tracking northeastward in the Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Azores, an archipelago in the North Atlantic, as Gabrielle is expected to approach the islands. The powerful storm is also generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Canada, for several days. Despite initial predictions for a busier-than-usual season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far this year.</p>

          <p>YouTube announced a policy reversal, allowing previously banned accounts to apply for reinstatement, specifically those removed for Covid-19 or election-related misinformation. This limited pilot project, detailed in a letter to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, rolls back prior lifetime bans for such offenses. The change follows mounting Republican pressure on tech companies to revise Biden-era speech policies on vaccine and political misinformation. YouTube stated that its community guidelines now permit a wider range of content on these topics and that it will not empower third-party fact-checkers for content moderation, although it will continue to display information panels with links to independent fact checks. This move mirrors Meta's recent elimination of its fact-checking program on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

          <p>Michelob Ultra has become the top-selling beer in the U.S. by volume, according to its parent company Anheuser-Busch, two years after its Bud Light brand lost the title following a consumer boycott. This success marks a significant turnaround for Anheuser-Busch, which faced criticism over its social media partnership with a transgender influencer. Conversely, Modelo's owner, Constellation, has cited tougher U.S. immigration policies and a decline in Hispanic consumers as factors in its falling sales. The broader U.S. beer industry has experienced a lackluster year, reflecting changing American drinking habits. Michelob Ultra's rise is attributed to new product launches and increased marketing investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's substantial increase in H-1B visa fees, now $100,000 for new applications, is prompting tech companies and skilled foreign workers to look beyond the U.S., presenting a "wonderful opportunity" for Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has acknowledged the potential to attract talent, especially recent international graduates. While Canada's 2023 program for H-1B holders saw 10,000 sign-ups in 24 hours, experts caution that Canada's immigration system has its own challenges, including lower wages and recent policy scale-backs. Economists suggest that Canada needs further overhauls to become a truly attractive and predictable destination for these highly skilled workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, 59, has been found guilty of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course last September, along with multiple firearm offenses. The incident occurred as Trump was playing golf, when a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle and fired upon Routh, who then fled. Routh, who pleaded not guilty and defended himself, made bizarre statements throughout the trial. Evidence presented included a rifle with a scope, a list of Trump's appearances, and a note stating it was an "assassination attempt." This marks the second high-profile attempt on Trump's life that year, raising heightened concerns about political violence in America.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent shift on Ukraine, from urging surrender to advocating for reclaiming all territory, is analyzed as part of a broader pattern of an "emboldened" presidency. This dramatic U-turn follows a series of controversial remarks, including expressing hatred for opponents, offering unscientific advice on autism and Tylenol, and a fiery address at the United Nations General Assembly. The article suggests Trump thrives on controversy and is feeling less constrained, using these moments to energize his base. While his combative style appeals to supporters, it risks deepening political polarization and marks a presidency characterized by significant policy changes and public disputes.</p>

The Inflation Reduction Act's $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EV credits have driven record sales, with August seeing a 17.7% year-over-year increase for new EVs and a 59% surge for used models. Dealerships are offering additional incentives to clear inventory before new models arrive. While this has boosted short-term sales, experts anticipate a potential slowdown post-expiration, as automakers have already begun to shift focus away from EV production due to policy changes.

Three homes were destroyed, and over a dozen others were damaged, with one family losing their home and most pets. The 2-year-old, Xavier Padilla Aguilera, died when a flash flood swept away a vehicle in Barstow.

It explains that while some studies show an association, others, particularly a large Swedish sibling study, found no causal link, attributing observed correlations to other factors like genetics. Medical experts emphasize that untreated fever and pain during pregnancy pose significant risks, and acetaminophen remains one of the safest options. The article advises parents to trust medical providers over non-experts and understand that association does not equate to causation, using an analogy of shark attacks and ice cream sales.</p>
