        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated his intent to dismiss Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, after federal investigators found no clear evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James with mortgage fraud. Sources suggest that Trump administration officials had pressured Siebert to bring charges regardless of the evidence. The potential firing has caused alarm within the Justice Department over the politicization of the office, which handles many of the nation's critical national security cases. James's attorney described the move as a "brazen attack on the rule of law."</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy 85-page filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. However, the court has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professionally structured amended complaint, limited to 40 pages. Trump responded to the dismissal by asserting, "I'm winning, I'm winning the cases," during an Oval Office event.</p>

          <p>Retired professional boxer Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas luxury car dealership, accusing it of deceptive trade practices and fraud. The lawsuit alleges that the dealer significantly overcharged him for a 2018 Maybach Landaulet, claiming the purchase price was $1.1 million when it was reportedly only $728,000. Mayweather's legal team also claims the vehicle lacked the necessary legal documentation, including title and compliance certifications, making the sale illegitimate. The boxer is seeking to hold the dealership accountable for what he describes as dishonest business practices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have reportedly made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, although a final agreement has not yet been reached. The discussions are centered on a framework to address U.S. national security concerns, which stem from a law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American operations. Trump, who has previously extended the deadline for the divestiture multiple times, expressed optimism that a deal is "well on its way" and just needs to be formally signed.</p>

          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner has publicly supported Jimmy Kimmel following the indefinite suspension of his show by ABC, a Disney subsidiary. Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he termed "out-of-control intimidation," suggesting the network caved to political pressure after Carr threatened action over Kimmel's comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. In his statement, Eisner defended Kimmel as talented and funny and questioned the leadership of corporations that fail to stand up for First Amendment principles against government bullying. He framed the incident as a concerning example of suppressing speech for political self-interest.</p>

          <p>A vaccine advisory panel, with new members appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has weakened its recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine. The committee now advises that vaccination should be based on "shared clinical decision-making" between patients and their healthcare providers, rather than a universal recommendation for everyone aged 6 months and older. This change in guidance has sparked concern among public health experts, who fear it may create confusion and reduce vaccination rates, particularly for a vaccine that numerous studies have shown to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness.</p>

This marks the second time in a week a NATO member has invoked Article 4, which triggers formal consultations when a member's territorial integrity or security is threatened.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to introduce a new $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas, which are used to hire highly-skilled foreign workers for jobs that are difficult to fill domestically. This significant fee increase is part of a wider crackdown on immigration and targets a program that has been crucial for the technology sector. The H-1B program has faced criticism for allegedly being used by companies to hire foreign workers at lower wages, thereby undercutting American workers. The move is expected to have a substantial impact on companies that rely on the program to source international talent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and allow it to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals living in the country. The request seeks to freeze a lower court's order that found the administration's attempt to end the humanitarian program was unlawful. The administration argues that TPS was never intended to be a permanent status and is moving to end the program for multiple countries. This legal battle places the fate of approximately 300,000 Venezuelans, who were granted protection due to the crisis in their home country, in the hands of the high court.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market movement reflects investor focus on long-term factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, including expectations for economic growth, inflation, and the scale of government debt issuance. While the Fed's cut lowered short-term rates, the increase in long-term yields suggests that concerns about the broader economic outlook and government finances are weighing on the bond market.

Head coach Pete Carroll also dismissed the report as inaccurate, stating that his conversations with Brady are more general in nature.

While stating he was personally pleased that Kimmel faced consequences, Cruz argued that it is "dangerous as hell" for the government to get into the business of threatening media outlets based on their content.
