          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has stated that Intel should provide the U.S. government with a non-voting equity stake in return for funds from the CHIPS Act. This represents a strategic shift from the previous administration's grant-based approach, aiming for the American public to gain a financial share in the companies it supports. The policy change comes as Intel proceeds with plans to reshore advanced semiconductor manufacturing with new facilities in Ohio. This new equity-for-funding model could potentially be applied to other recipients of federal CHIPS funding as well. (not investment advice)</p>

The sell-off in digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether mirrored a broader slump in the Nasdaq, driven by declines in major tech stocks, as investors await signals on future interest rate policies from the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Walmart is recalling specific lots of its Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp following a warning from the Food and Drug Administration about potential radioactive contamination. The FDA issued the alert after detecting the isotope Cesium-137 in a different shipment from the same Indonesian supplier, PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati, though that shipment did not enter U.S. commerce. While no contamination has been found in the recalled products and the detected levels were below the FDA's threshold for acute concern, the agency warned of long-term cancer risks from repeated low-dose exposure. Consumers are advised to dispose of the product and can receive a full refund.</p>

          <p>A new study from the USC Schaeffer Center challenges the justification provided by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for restructuring a key government vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy had cited persistent conflicts of interest, but the research published in JAMA found that such conflicts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were at historic lows for years. The study revealed that the most concerning conflicts, such as personal income from vaccine makers, had been virtually eliminated. This research emerges as Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, continues to overhaul federal health agencies and pursue policies that could impact U.S. immunization strategies.</p>

Meyer contrasted Michigan's punishment, which includes a fine over $20 million and a suspension for its head coach, with the harsher sanctions Ohio State received in 2011, which included a bowl ban that affected uninvolved players. While he agreed that current Michigan players should not be punished, Meyer asserted that the ruling demonstrates the NCAA's diminished power as an enforcement body in collegiate sports.</p>

          <p>Two women who previously pleaded guilty to stealing thousands of pounds worth of popular Jellycat soft toys from various shops in London failed to appear for their sentencing at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court. As a result, arrest warrants without bail have been issued for Sarah Jordan, 35, and Amber Clarke, 24. The charges against the women detail numerous thefts between late 2024 and mid-2025, with the stolen goods including over £6,000 worth of Jellycat toys, as well as food, clothing, and other items. Both women also faced charges for failing to appear at previous court hearings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit filed by civil rights attorneys concerning the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades. The judge ruled that the claim regarding a lack of clarity over which immigration court had jurisdiction is now moot, as the government has since designated a court to hear the detainees' cases. However, the judge allowed other claims to proceed, including allegations that the facility violates the First Amendment by impeding detainees' confidential access to their lawyers. The case concerning legal access has been transferred to a different federal court.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint against a group of individuals for allegedly using a network of fake accounts and sophisticated software to purchase and resell hundreds of thousands of tickets on Ticketmaster. The group is accused of violating the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act by acquiring tickets for high-demand concerts, including those of Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, and then reselling them on secondary markets for a significant profit. The complaint details how the operation spent nearly $57 million on tickets, which were then resold for almost $64 million, with $1.2 million in profit coming from Taylor Swift's Eras Tour alone.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sharply criticized Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, accusing him of betraying Israel and abandoning Australia's Jewish community. The comments mark a severe escalation in diplomatic tensions between the two nations. The rift follows Australia's decision to recognize a Palestinian state and its recent cancellation of a visa for a far-right member of Netanyahu's coalition government. In response, Israel has revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, further straining the relationship between the two countries.</p>

          <p>A UK High Court has granted Epping Forest District Council a temporary injunction, ruling that an Essex hotel must stop housing asylum seekers. The judge ordered that the migrants currently residing at The Bell Hotel must be moved out by September 12. The council sought the injunction citing public safety risks and planning law breaches following weeks of protests in the area, which were sparked after an asylum seeker at the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a teenager. The Home Office had argued against the injunction, warning it could significantly impact its ability to house asylum seekers nationwide.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the "steady progress" in bilateral relations with China during a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This positive assessment comes after years of strained ties between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, which hit a low point following a deadly border clash in 2020. A diplomatic thaw began last year, and Modi is now scheduled to visit China at the end of August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip there in seven years. The improving relationship coincides with increased trade friction between India and its traditional ally, the United States.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly been using a Sheraton hotel in Louisiana, part of the Marriott chain, to detain immigrants ahead of deportation. This appears to contradict a public pledge made by Marriott in 2019 that its properties would not be used as detention facilities. Evidence suggests the hotel near a major deportation hub has been used to hold families and children, with one recent case involving a father and son held for four days before being deported. It remains unclear whether Marriott has a formal contract with ICE or is aware of the use of its franchised property for this purpose.</p>

The company's official position is that it is not involved in or notified about the raids. This silence has drawn criticism from advocates who argue that the company has a moral obligation to defend the day laborers, who are both customers and a key labor source for the contractors who shop there.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a public university president's ban on drag shows violates the First Amendment, though the decision came more than two years after the initial prohibition. The case, Spectrum WT v. Wendler, involved the president of West Texas A&M University canceling a planned student LGBTQ+ group event. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals eventually affirmed that drag is a form of expression protected by the Constitution. However, the significant delay in the ruling, attributed partly to the initial decision by a notoriously conservative trial judge, meant that many affected students graduated before their rights were affirmed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities offer the security of guaranteed, lifelong income, they come with significant disadvantages that potential retirees should carefully consider. High fees, including management and administrative costs, can erode returns over time, while steep surrender charges penalize early withdrawals, reducing financial flexibility. The complexity of annuity contracts often obscures their true costs and benefits, and the fixed payments of some annuities may not keep pace with inflation, diminishing purchasing power over the long term. Compared to stock market investments, annuities typically offer lower growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>
