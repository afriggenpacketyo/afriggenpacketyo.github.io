          <p>Russian forces launched a large-scale drone and missile barrage targeting cities across Ukraine, resulting in at least 18 deaths, including children, and numerous injuries. Ukrainian air defenses claimed to have neutralized a significant portion of the incoming attacks, but strikes still impacted residential areas and enterprises. Russia claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex, while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes as deliberate attacks on ordinary cities and called for stronger international pressure on Russia. The attacks occurred despite the completion of a major prisoner exchange between the two countries, highlighting the ongoing intensity of the conflict and the failure of U.S.-brokered peace talks to achieve a lasting ceasefire. The violence underscores the lack of progress in diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. Optimism score must reflect the tragic loss of life and the continued escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A philosophy professor at West Point resigned in protest of the Trump administration's decision to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs at the academy. The professor, Graham Parsons, criticized Trump's choice to wear a Make America Great Again hat during the commencement address, viewing it as a symbol of the administration's intrusion into academic affairs. Parsons stated that West Point began censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideological preferences, effectively banning his research agenda and betraying the academy's professional integrity. He believes the orders are to indoctrinate, not educate, and represent a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, his family is advocating for the preservation of George Floyd Square in Minneapolis as a historic site. The family envisions a pedestrian plaza with a memorial, shops, and a library to revitalize the area and honor Floyd's legacy.

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuel projects, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas production, particularly in overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. While promoting clean energy initiatives through the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), many projects focus on natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage, with LNG framed as a "transitional fuel." However, studies suggest LNG involves significantly more emissions than coal, leading to accusations of "greenwashing" and hindering the transition to renewable energy in partner countries like Indonesia. This contradiction raises concerns about Japan's commitment to its climate-friendly promises.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert has developed a new framework called 'emotionally safe parenting,' which emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach encourages parents to accept their child's emotions without judgment, view challenging behavior as a signal for support, and set boundaries with empathy rather than control. Emotionally safe parenting also involves self-awareness and inner healing for the parents, creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing themselves authentically. By focusing on emotional safety, parents can help their children thrive and build healthy relationships.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile barrage on Ukraine, resulting in casualties and damage across the country, which officials say underscores Moscow's lack of interest in a truce. The attack, one of the largest of the war, occurred despite cease-fire negotiations and signals an escalation in violence. The strikes have hit western and southern regions of Ukraine, highlighting the strain on Ukrainian air defenses, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has called for increased pressure on Putin. Despite the ongoing fighting, Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, underscoring the complex dynamics of the conflict.</p>

With no independent monitors present, many believe the results will again be manufactured, with the vote being seen as a means for Maduro to project a veneer of democracy. The vote has reopened a rift among opposition activists, who are divided over whether to participate or abstain as a means of protest, reflecting ongoing challenges to democratic processes in the country.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Georgia resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and potential deportation. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, arrested Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation, which was later dropped. However, the arrest triggered immigration enforcement, and Arias-Cristobal, who had been brought to the U.S. as a child, was detained by ICE. This incident has sparked criticism and highlighted the impact of local law enforcement's collaboration with immigration authorities, leading to calls for reform and support for the affected teenager.</p>

Outraged by the impersonal telegrams sent to families during the Vietnam War, Moore advocated for in-person notifications by service members.

Her actions led to the Army adopting a new policy of personal notifications and support for grieving families, and she is honored at Ft. Moore, formerly Ft. Benning.</p>
