            <p>A federal judge ruled in favor of the Associated Press in its legal battle with the White House, ordering officials to restore the news outlet's access to spaces and events open to White House reporters. The ruling stems from the White House restricting AP's access after the news agency declined to adopt the term "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico." Judge McFadden stated that the government cannot exclude journalists based on their viewpoints, citing First Amendment rights, and the decision was temporarily stayed to allow for a potential appeal. The AP argued that its reporting quality suffered due to the restricted access.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed the measles outbreak in western Texas is slowing down, citing data since early March, after CDC reinforcements were sent to supply vaccines and medication. However, data from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates cases are increasing, with more counties reporting infections. Public health specialists express skepticism, suggesting the official case count is likely an undercount due to difficulties reaching some communities and potential avoidance of testing. Kennedy also promoted aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin as treatments, though experts say they are not standard for measles cases.</p>

The market initially rebounded on hopes of tariff negotiations, but gains were erased following the White House announcement.

            <p>The L.A. County Board of Supervisors is working to accelerate home rebuilding in Altadena after the county failed to issue a single permit in the three months following the Eaton fire. The supervisors voted to create a "unified permitting authority" to streamline the approval process. The move comes in response to delays and frustration from homeowners dealing with the aftermath of the devastating fire. The new authority will have the final say on permitting issues, aiming to expedite the rebuilding process.</p>

            <p>The S&P 500 experienced its worst week since the COVID-19 pandemic due to a tariff-fueled sell-off, but experts anticipate a different recovery this time. Unlike the swift rebound following the pandemic crash, the current market shock is seen as a confidence issue, requiring more time to recover. The key difference is that President Trump has a potential "off" switch for the chaos, but has not shown signs of relenting. The Federal Reserve's response is also uncertain due to the combination of slowing growth and rising inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting the U.S. coal industry by reversing policies that transitioned away from coal production. The actions define coal as a "mineral," ease coal mining on federal lands, and prioritize coal leasing. Trump also directed agencies to rescind policies transitioning away from coal production and investigate states discriminating against coal. Despite these efforts, coal production decreased during Trump's first term, and the industry faces challenges from cheaper alternatives and environmental concerns.</p>

            <p>Oren Cass, chief economist at American Compass, defends President Trump's tariffs as a means to prioritize domestic manufacturing and support American workers. He argues that making things in the U.S. matters and that economists have wrongly dismissed the importance of a strong industrial base. Cass believes that tariffs, while potentially causing short-term costs, can lead to long-term benefits for the American economy. He suggests that Americans are willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. to support a re-industrialized nation.</p>
