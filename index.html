          <p>Donald Trump's second presidency has been marked by significant shifts in US policy and a divisive political climate. During his first 100 days, Trump has pursued an "America First" agenda, implementing tariffs, questioning alliances like NATO, and taking a hard line on immigration. His administration's actions have sparked both support and widespread protests, leaving many Americans uncertain about the country's future direction. Despite promises to quickly resolve issues like the war in Ukraine, challenges persist, and the administration faces scrutiny for its handling of various domestic and international matters.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic policies, characterized by trade wars and treaty withdrawals, have fundamentally disrupted the established global economic order. In his first 100 days, he has made significant progress in dismantling governmental infrastructure and challenging international norms. The long-term consequences of these changes remain uncertain, but the disruption caused by the Trump administration may prove difficult to reverse, even after his term ends. The future direction of the global economy hinges on the durability of these policy shifts and the response from other nations.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting operations nationwide to locate unaccompanied immigrant children, intending to deport them, pursue criminal charges against them, or prosecute their sponsors. These actions have sparked concerns about "backdoor family separation" and raise questions about the welfare of vulnerable children. While DHS claims these are "welfare checks", internal documents reveal that ICE is also gathering intelligence to assess whether the children are a flight risk or a threat to public safety, leading to fears that the operations are primarily for enforcement purposes.</p>

          <p>International students are reconsidering their plans to study in the US due to recent changes in visa policy. While the Department of Homeland Security has restored the legal status of thousands of international students, the initial policy shift has created uncertainty. College experts say this is causing some international applicants to rethink their plans for the fall of 2025, potentially impacting international enrollment and revenue for US colleges and universities.</p>

          <h2>Trump Coins Lauds Trump for Soaring Gold Prices</h2>

          <p>A marketing email from Trump Coins attributes the soaring value of gold to President Trump's policies, while experts suggest it reflects economic uncertainty. The email claims Trump's stance on tariffs and American industry is driving investors to safe-haven metals. However, experts argue that rising gold prices are often linked to economic turmoil and a lack of confidence in alternative safe-haven assets like the US dollar and Treasury bonds.
