          <p>Following Starbucks' announcement of a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes store closures and corporate layoffs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed the company's stock. He described the move to close underperforming stores as a "necessary" and "very bullish" step in the CEO's turnaround strategy. Cramer believes reallocating resources to better-performing locations will strengthen the company, reiterating his "buy" rating and a $100 price target for the coffee giant's shares.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could play a significant role in resolving the war in Ukraine by ceasing purchases of Russian oil. Speaking to reporters, Trump emphasized that if Erdoğan chose to get involved, his most effective action would be to cut off this key source of funding for Russia's war effort. The comments were made ahead of discussions between the two leaders, which were set to focus on the war and trade, including Turkey's interest in purchasing U.S. fighter jets.</p>

Despite a detailed memo stating there was no probable cause, President Trump's newly appointed U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury anyway. This move follows Trump's public directive to prosecute political adversaries and has raised concerns among career prosecutors about ethics and DOJ policy.</p>

          <p>Shares of used-auto retailer CarMax dropped by more than 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street expectations. The company's CEO described the fiscal second quarter as "challenging," citing changing market conditions and depreciation in its vehicle inventory for the lackluster performance. The significant stock decline has sent ripples through the automotive retail sector, as CarMax is often seen as a bellwether for the health of the used-car market.</p>

          <p>Used auto retailer CarMax saw its stock price fall by over 20% after failing to meet Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for its second fiscal quarter. The company reported lower-than-anticipated earnings per share and a 6% year-over-year decline in revenue, attributing the poor performance to challenging market conditions and inventory depreciation. The results have raised concerns across the auto retail sector, as CarMax's performance is often viewed as a key indicator for the industry's health.</p>

This article examines the value of long-term care insurance, which can protect savings from being depleted by costs for services like nursing homes and in-home health aides, which are not typically covered by Medicare. It suggests that applying for coverage while still in good health is advantageous, as premiums increase with age and pre-existing conditions can lead to denial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has ruled that the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set breached editorial guidelines on harm and offence. The ruling cited the band's on-stage chant of "death, death to the IDF" and other derogatory and antisemitic comments as the primary violations. However, the complaints unit cleared the performance of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime, stating the controversial slogans could be seen as political expression rather than direct threats of violence.</p>

          <p>HSBC, in partnership with IBM, announced it has successfully used quantum computing to improve the accuracy of its algorithmic bond price predictions by 34%. The bank hailed the trial as a "ground-breaking world-first," demonstrating a practical application of the emerging technology in the financial services industry. By combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, HSBC was better able to analyze complex market data, potentially leading to increased margins and greater liquidity in over-the-counter markets.</p>

          <p>Chelsea women's football manager Sonia Bompastor revealed that she is often asked in job interviews if it's possible to be a mother of four and manage a top club, a question she believes would never be posed to a man.

Bompastor, who led her team to a domestic treble, emphasized that while progress has been made, there is still significant room for improvement in addressing sexism within the sport.</p>

          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have received an unexpected boost as consumers rush to buy cars before potential price hikes from new tariffs and the expiration of EV tax credits. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million vehicles, citing this trend of 'pull-ahead' buying driven by policy uncertainty. While this has benefited automakers in the short term, analysts expect sales to slow in the fourth quarter and into next year once the policy changes take full effect. (not investment advice)</p>
