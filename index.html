          <p>Meng Fanli, the current party chief of Shenzhen, has been promoted to party chief of Guangdong's government, effectively making him the governor-in-waiting for China's largest provincial economy. The 60-year-old's appointment is expected to be formally confirmed by the provincial legislature soon. This move fills the vacancy left by incumbent Governor Wang Weizhong, who was recently promoted to party chief of Inner Mongolia. The personnel changes follow a monthly Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, a common time for such high-level provincial appointments.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm, is expected to generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip current conditions along most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. The storm rapidly intensified to Category 5 over the weekend before weakening, but remains a powerful system. Its center is forecast to pass west and north of Bermuda on Tuesday and Wednesday, where tropical storm conditions are possible. This marks Humberto as the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with forecasters also monitoring Tropical Storm Imelda.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday morning, though its path indicates it will move away from the southeastern U.S. and approach Bermuda by Wednesday. The storm, the ninth named system of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is currently north of Great Abaco Island with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. Imelda is expected to bring significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas, causing potential flash flooding and mudslides, with one fatality already reported in Cuba due to landslides.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of deceased hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no future governance role for Hamas and leaves open the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state. While the Palestinian Authority and several Arab nations welcomed the initiative, Netanyahu vowed to "finish the job" of destroying Hamas if the group rejects the agreement.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military personnel have begun legal proceedings against U.S. industrial giant 3M, alleging that faulty combat earplugs supplied by the company caused life-changing injuries, including tinnitus and deafness. 3M previously settled similar claims from 240,000 U.S. servicemen for $6 billion, though without admitting liability, and plans to defend itself in English courts. Veterans like Dave Watson, who served in Afghanistan, describe significant impacts on their daily lives due to hearing problems. This legal action highlights a persistent issue, with studies showing high rates of hearing loss among veterans, and follows a 2018 U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit where 3M paid $9.1 million over allegations the earplugs were too short.</p>

Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the bitcoin, which originated from a large-scale scam in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 victims. The Metropolitan Police's seven-year investigation, spanning multiple jurisdictions, led to her arrest after she fled China using false documents and attempted to launder money by buying property in the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service is working to ensure the stolen funds are returned, with many victims having already received compensation through a Chinese scheme.</p>

A private survey, RatingDog's manufacturing PMI, showed expansion at 51.2, beating forecasts. Analysts suggest the upcoming October Politburo meeting will provide insights into economic policy plans, with the government potentially tolerating a Q3 slowdown if the full-year 5% growth target remains achievable.

Coberg faces up to 30 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for February.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested a criminal investigation into Christopher Wray, his former FBI director, based on false claims from a conservative media outlet that FBI agents were involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. Trump promoted the story, asserting that Wray had lied about FBI involvement. This follows the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump also targeted. Despite an Inspector General report finding no evidence of FBI informants encouraging illegal activity on January 6, Trump appears increasingly emboldened to call for prosecution of political opponents, denying direct pressure on the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A humanitarian convoy led by Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa, including UN and EU diplomats, was attacked with Molotov cocktails by approximately 350 people during a national strike, resulting in 17 soldiers being taken hostage. The incident occurred in Cotacachi amidst violent protests over fuel subsidy cuts, with the country's largest Indigenous rights group, Conaie, reporting a member shot dead by armed forces. President Noboa condemned the "terrorist act" and accused the Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua of orchestrating the demonstrations. A state of emergency has been declared in several provinces as clashes intensify.</p>

          <p>An article suggests that Hong Kong should become China’s gateway to the United Nations, potentially serving as the UN’s Asia headquarters. This move could support the organization's reforms and reinforce Beijing's vision of global governance, particularly given Asia's large population and the UN's limited presence there. Hong Kong's unique attributes, including English as an official language, common law, and low corporate taxes, make it an ideal location. Leveraging institutions like the International Organisation for Mediation, Hong Kong could enhance China's engagement with the UN, where China is already the second-largest donor, effectively bringing the world to China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is on the brink of a shutdown as President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress failed to reach a funding agreement. Republicans advocate for a short-term extension of current spending, while Democrats demand an end to Trump's unilateral spending cuts and a firm agreement on renewing health-insurance subsidies. Both sides are digging in, with Republicans blaming Democrats for making demands and Democrats feeling compelled to resist Trump's policies, especially after previous concessions. The White House has even circulated a memo outlining plans for long-term federal spending and employment reductions during a shutdown, adding to the political tension.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan is currently experiencing a "total internet blackout" following a nationwide shutdown of telecommunications imposed by the Taliban government, weeks after it began severing fiber-optic internet connections. International news agencies have lost contact with offices in Kabul, and mobile internet and satellite TV are severely disrupted. The Taliban has not provided an official reason, but since 2021, they have imposed numerous restrictions under Sharia law. Business leaders warn of serious impacts, and the shutdown has led to disruptions in banking services and flights from Kabul airport, with critics drawing parallels to North Korea's internet isolation.</p>

          <p>California and several other Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration, alleging it stripped them of hundreds of millions in federal security and disaster relief funding due to their sanctuary city policies. Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the cuts as an illegal attempt to coerce states into federal immigration enforcement, defying a recent ruling that barred such conditions on emergency funding. The lawsuit argues that the funding, intended for disaster preparedness and first responders, is being reallocated based on political favoritism rather than objective risk assessments. This marks the 40th lawsuit filed by California against the current administration, highlighting ongoing federal-state conflicts over immigration policy.</p>
