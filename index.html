          <p>Russian forces launched a barrage of drones and missiles across Ukraine, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including children, and numerous injuries, despite an ongoing prisoner exchange between the two countries. Ukrainian air defenses claimed to have neutralized a significant portion of the incoming attacks, but strikes still impacted residential areas and infrastructure in multiple regions. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate acts of terror against ordinary cities and called for increased international pressure on Russia through sanctions. The attacks occurred amidst stalled peace talks and despite a large prisoner exchange, underscoring the continued intensity of the conflict. The author's tone reflects the tragedy of the civilian casualties and the continued need for international intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Alan Bates, a former subpostmaster and advocate for victims of the Post Office scandal, asserts that the government's compensation offer amounts to less than half of his claim. He criticizes the government for presiding over "quasi-kangaroo courts" and shifting the goalposts on judgments, despite promises of a non-legalistic approach. Bates is calling for an independent body to administer compensation schemes for public sector scandals, highlighting the slow progress and ongoing struggles faced by many subpostmasters affected by the faulty Horizon IT system. The government insists it aims to give postmasters the benefit of the doubt and offers a review process for those unhappy with their offers.</p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham advises the public to remain calm following the detection of West Nile virus fragments in UK mosquitoes, stating that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change. While there have been no human cases of locally-acquired West Nile Virus in the UK to date, the expert emphasizes the need for awareness and preventative measures such as avoiding mosquito bites. Surveillance projects are underway to monitor mosquito activity across Britain, and the public is encouraged to cover up and use insecticide to minimize risk.</p>

          <p>Despite continued Russian attacks, including one on Kyiv that left three dead, Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners as part of a larger agreement.

However, the exchange did not halt the fighting, as both sides continued to launch attacks and maintain their positions along the front line. The article also highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts and the vast differences between the two sides regarding key conditions for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist, who was lured to Woeltz's SoHo apartment under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin. The victim, who had been held captive for several weeks, managed to escape and alert authorities, revealing graphic details of the torture he endured, including electric shocks and being forced to smoke crack cocaine. Authorities recovered evidence from the apartment, including weapons and disturbing images, and are continuing to investigate the case, with a second individual initially arrested but later released pending further investigation.</p>
