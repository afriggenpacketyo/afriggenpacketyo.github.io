          <p>The nearly 30-year-old disappearance of Iowa news anchor Jodi Huisentruit is seeing renewed attention as authorities continue the search for her remains and a private investigator fights to unseal case records. A judge has partially unsealed a 2017 search warrant related to the case but kept the supporting affidavit sealed to protect the ongoing investigation, focusing on GPS tracking devices placed on vehicles tied to a person of interest, John Vansice. Huisentruit's family opposes unsealing the documents, fearing it could hinder the investigation. Huisentruit vanished on her way to work in 1995, with her car found at her apartment along with signs of a struggle.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel, with Israeli authorities accusing them of intending to spread hate speech against the country.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized the decision, calling it unacceptable and counterproductive.

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published just before a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, analyzes 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake active periods. The timing of the research has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study suggests the recent quake in Myanmar may not be an isolated incident.</p>

          <p>This article examines the white working class, arguing their distinctiveness stems less from ethnicity and more from geography, as they are often located outside major metropolitan areas with limited social mobility. It critiques the notion of a homogenous white working class, highlighting the diversity of opinions on immigration and the dangers of "ventriloquised xenophobia," where elite prejudices are masked as working-class concerns. The piece also challenges the Labour party's shift away from class politics, suggesting a need to reclaim class-based approaches to address the issues facing the white working class. The article calls for nuanced understanding and recognition of both the distinctiveness and diversity within this demographic.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Britain should not be cowed by Trump's tariff policies but instead should collaborate with the G7 (excluding the US) and the EU to sustain a rules-based global trading system. It suggests re-orienting trade around a new global order, with Canada playing a pivotal role. The author proposes associating Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extending that association to a newly relevant Commonwealth, including African and Asian members.

This new route could provide the PLA with alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel.

          <p>Mark Cuban has cautioned that President Trump's tariff plan, combined with DOGE cuts, could have severe long-term economic consequences, potentially leading to a crisis "far worse" than the 2008 financial crisis. Cuban suggests that the tariffs, if sustained and inflationary, along with workforce reductions led by the DOGE office, could destabilize the economy. He connects the cuts to agencies like the CFPB and the IRS's tax evasion enforcement wing with concerns about economic health.</p>
