        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has entered a shutdown, leading to potential furloughs for up to 750,000 federal workers as Democrats and Republicans failed to reach a funding agreement. The shutdown stems from disagreements over healthcare tax credits and funding priorities, with both parties blaming each other for the impasse. Federal agencies are initiating shutdown procedures, halting non-essential functions, and impacting various services. Essential employees will continue working without pay, and the duration of the shutdown remains uncertain as negotiations continue between lawmakers to find a resolution to the funding dispute. Optimism remains that a compromise will be reached to restore government operations. </p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of government shutdowns in the United States since 1980, detailing the causes and durations of 14 previous funding lapses. The shutdowns occurred under various presidents and congressional control, often stemming from disagreements over spending priorities, budget deficits, or policy issues like healthcare and immigration. The most recent shutdown in late 2018 resulted in significant financial losses, and the article highlights the increasing frequency of these events in recent decades. These shutdowns serve as a reminder of the political gridlock that can disrupt government operations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal government has partially shut down after Congress failed to approve funding, primarily due to disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies. The shutdown has resulted in hundreds of thousands of federal workers facing furlough, with essential employees continuing to work without pay. The article outlines the process by which Congress funds the government annually and the consequences of failing to meet funding deadlines. Negotiations between the parties have stalled, with both sides blaming each other for the impasse, leading to uncertainty about the duration and impact of the shutdown. </p>

          <h2>Congress and the President Continue to Receive Pay During Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 10:24:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the question of whether members of Congress and the President continue to receive pay during a government shutdown. Despite the potential for federal employees to face unpaid work or layoffs, the Constitution guarantees that lawmakers and the President will continue to receive their salaries. The article explains that lawmakers' pay is funded by a permanent appropriation, while other federal entities are governed by the Antideficiency Act, which restricts spending without congressional approval. While congressional staffers' pay may be delayed, the President's salary cannot be reduced while in office, ensuring their compensation regardless of shutdown actions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) posted a banner on its website blaming the government shutdown on the "Radical Left," prompting an ethics complaint alleging a violation of the Hatch Act. Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, argues that the banner is highly partisan and inappropriately promotes the Trump administration. The Hatch Act restricts political activities of federal employees to ensure nonpartisan administration of federal programs. The Office of Special Counsel, responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, has been contacted for comment, raising concerns about ethics enforcement within the executive branch. </p>

          <p>A government shutdown could potentially disrupt air travel in the U.S., although a short shutdown is unlikely to have a major impact. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) deem most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work without pay. However, a prolonged shutdown could lead to labor shortages as employees face financial pressure, potentially causing longer airport security lines and flight delays. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while train travel is unlikely to be disrupted in the near term. </p>

          <p>This article explains what a government shutdown is and what happens when funding runs out, as the U.S. government partially shut down due to Congress's failure to reach a funding deal. A shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for agencies, halting non-essential functions, and affecting various government services. Essential employees continue to work without pay, while others are furloughed, and the Office of Budget and Management has instructed agencies to consider mass layoffs. The shutdown can disrupt travel, delay entitlement programs, and hamper enforcement and investigations, with potential long-term economic consequences. </p>

          <p>The government shutdown will impact the U.S. military, forcing active-duty service members to continue serving without timely pay.

Comey's defense team has multiple avenues to challenge the charges, including arguing selective prosecution and questioning the clarity of the indictment. The appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a Trump ally, as U.S. Attorney adds a layer of political scrutiny to the case. Critics suggest that Trump's involvement could lead to external repercussions, and some view Comey's acquittal as the more likely outcome due to the complexities of the case. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attributed the increase in small boat arrivals to Brexit, citing the UK's departure from EU agreements that previously allowed for the return of asylum seekers. Prior to Brexit, the UK returned more people than it received, but this trend reversed after the 2016 referendum. Migration experts also point to other Brexit-related factors, such as the loss of access to the EU's fingerprint database, as contributing to the rise in crossings. Reform UK has refuted these claims, but data indicates that the UK has had no effective mechanism to return asylum seekers to the EU since leaving the Dublin regulation. </p>

          <p>Germany's Oktoberfest beer festival is set to reopen on Wednesday evening after a temporary closure due to a bomb threat linked to an earlier house fire and suspected suicide. Munich's mayor announced that the festival grounds will reopen at 5:30 p.m. local time, following police confirmation that there is no threat to the event. The closure was prompted by a fire and explosions at a residence in the city's north, leading to precautionary checks at and around the Oktoberfest site. Security has been heightened over the years in response to past threats and a deadly attack in 1980. </p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new private-label grocery brand called Amazon Grocery, aimed at "price-conscious" shoppers, with most products priced under $5. The brand includes over 1,000 items, spanning dairy, produce, meat, snacks, and baking essentials, uniting its Happy Belly and Amazon Fresh brands. This move comes as Amazon seeks to streamline its grocery business, having recently announced the closure of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets in the U.K. The company is also expanding same-day delivery of fresh foods to encourage shoppers to add grocery items to their online orders. </p>

The United Nations had called for the immediate restoration of internet services, citing the risk of harming the Afghan people and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. </p>

She accused the reporter of being divisive and trying to stir up controversy, asserting that Democrats want to save healthcare for all people. The confrontation occurred shortly before the federal government entered a shutdown due to a failure to reach a funding deal. </p>

          <p>The ADP National Employment Report revealed that private employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in September, signaling a weakening labor market. This data may gain more attention due to the potential delay of the government's monthly jobs report because of the government shutdown. Small and mid-sized businesses accounted for most of the job losses, while large employers added jobs. Economists attribute the labor market weakness to economic challenges, such as tariffs and artificial intelligence, with some suggesting that tariffs are a primary culprit. </p>

          <p>A British High Court judge has ruled that PPE Medpro, a company linked to an underwear tycoon, must reimburse the government over $163 million for breaching a contract to supply surgical gowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court found that the gowns were not sterile and could not be used as such, leading to a breach of contract. The company, connected to Michelle Mone, was awarded the contracts under a fast-track model that favored companies recommended by politicians. The government sued PPE Medpro over allegations that the gowns were faulty, and the judgment was welcomed by the Treasury. </p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has fallen following the U.S. government shutdown, raising concerns among traders about the potential economic impact. The dollar index lost 0.2%, putting it on track for its worst annual decline in 22 years, down 10% for 2025. The shutdown, triggered by the Senate's failure to pass a short-term funding bill, has added to existing pessimism surrounding the U.S. dollar. This decline has driven gold futures to reach a fresh all-time high, reflecting investor uncertainty and a shift towards safe-haven assets. (not investment advice)</p>
