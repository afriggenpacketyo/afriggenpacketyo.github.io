            <p>Singapore's President dissolved parliament, setting the stage for a general election on May 3, with Nomination Day scheduled for April 23. This marks Lawrence Wong's first election as prime minister, succeeding Lee Hsien Loong, who had been in office since 2004. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which has governed since 1965, is expected to face challenges for all 97 parliamentary seats amid voter concerns about the cost of living and unemployment. The election occurs during a period of global economic uncertainty, including ongoing trade disputes with the U.S., which is projected to have zero growth this year. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports, potentially leading to tariffs based on national security concerns. The inquiries, conducted under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, require completion within 270 days and could significantly impact industries reliant on imports from countries like Taiwan. Drugmakers fear tariffs could cause shortages and reduced patient access, while Taiwan's government plans simulations for various tariff levels on semiconductors and seeks talks with the U.S. to ensure fair competition for its chip industry. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen over $2 billion in federal funds for Harvard University after the institution rejected a list of demands aimed at combating antisemitism on campus. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights, despite the government's warning of maintaining its financial relationship. The White House's demands included changes to governance, hiring practices, and admissions procedures, which Harvard deemed as direct governmental regulation of its intellectual conditions.

            <p>Following a deadly Russian attack in Ukraine, President Trump controversially blamed Ukrainian President Zelensky for starting the war, attributing blame to both Zelensky and Putin for the conflict. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence and criticized him for seeking missiles, asserting that one should only start a war if they can win. These comments follow previous clashes between Trump and Zelensky, including accusations of gambling with World War Three, and come amidst widespread condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands have been killed or injured since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

The Harbin Municipal Public Security Bureau issued arrest warrants for Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson, accusing them of working with the NSA's Office of Tailored Access Operations. Chinese cybersecurity experts claim the individuals used artificial intelligence (AI) to launch the attacks, targeting critical information infrastructure and enterprises like Huawei.

            <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton are reportedly facing a dilemma regarding the future education of their eldest son, Prince George, with differing opinions on which school he should attend. Kate is said to favor a less traditional, co-ed school, while William prefers Eton College, where he and Prince Harry were educated. Experts suggest Kate's preference stems from her own experiences with bullying, while William values the traditional education Eton provides. The decision reflects the challenge of balancing royal traditions with a desire for a more modern upbringing for the future king.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off, driving yields on the 10-year Treasury to their highest level since February, amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs. This sell-off raised questions about who was selling and why, considering that investors typically flock to U.S. debt during times of uncertainty. Potential sellers include China, Japan's life insurers, and hedge funds, each with their own motivations for reducing exposure to U.S. debt. The situation highlights the complex interplay between trade policy, investor behavior, and global economic dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>At least 40 people were killed in an attack on a Christian farming community in north-central Nigeria by Muslim gunmen, believed to be herders, prompting President Bola Tinubu to order an investigation. The attack on the Zike community in Plateau state resulted in destroyed and looted homes, with some reports suggesting the death toll could exceed 50. Such attacks, often attributed to Fulani herders, are common in the region due to conflicts over land resources, exacerbating tensions between farmers and herders, as well as Christians and Muslims. Amnesty International reports that 1,336 people were killed in Plateau state between December 2023 and February 2024.</p>

            <p>The debate over Formula 1 engines continues, with discussions on returning to V10 naturally aspirated engines ultimately rejected by a majority of engine manufacturers. While some fans romanticize the loud engines of the past, the sport's changing fanbase and the increasing importance of efficiency are key considerations. Fernando Alonso has emphasized the need to be pragmatic and recognize the evolution of technology, suggesting that the future may lie in hybrid engines. The new engine formula, expected around 2030 or 2031, will likely be a hybrid, with discussions ongoing about the size, cylinders, turbocharging, and hybrid proportion of the total power output.</p>

Critics argue the measures are used to distract from more serious problems and mobilize Orbán's right-wing base ahead of elections.
