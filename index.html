          <h2>English Pharmacies Threaten Reduced Hours Due to Funding Dispute</h2>

          <p>Approximately 6,000 community pharmacies in England are planning to reduce their operating hours unless the government agrees to increase NHS contract funding.  The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) cites rising costs and a decade of funding cuts as reasons for the potential action, which could disrupt patient access to services. The government maintains that negotiations are ongoing and the NPA's action is unnecessary.</p>

          <h2>Canada's Abundant Egg Supply Compared to US Shortage</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has an ample egg supply, unlike the US, which is experiencing record-high prices and shortages due to avian flu.  Experts attribute Canada's situation to smaller, more isolated farms, colder climates reducing bird-to-bird transmission, and fewer free-range chickens. The difference highlights contrasting agricultural models and supply management systems.</p>
