            <p>The ACLU is challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, arguing that their clients are at "imminent risk" of being deported to El Salvador. The deportations are based on claims that the migrants are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which the administration considers a "hybrid criminal state" invading the U.S. The ACLU argues that the migrants are not being given due process to challenge their removal, despite a recent Supreme Court ruling requiring it. The case raises concerns about the use of wartime authority to deport non-citizens.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has taken a significant step towards closing Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, deeming it "unlawful" to continue housing juveniles there. The ruling follows a state oversight body's finding that the facility is "unsuitable" due to staffing shortages and safety concerns. The probation department has been ordered to submit a plan for relocating approximately 270 juveniles to other secure locations. The decision comes amid ongoing reports of misconduct, injuries, and allegations of abuse at the facility.</p>

A memo indicates that providers must have private workspaces. This comes after concerns about the ability to conduct confidential sessions with veterans. However, confusion remains about whether therapists will be allowed to continue working from home if private office space is unavailable, and the VA has not commented further on the issue.</p>
