        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, U.S. Treasury yields experienced a surge, with the 30-year yield briefly surpassing 5%, a level unseen since November 2023, before settling slightly lower. The downgrade, attributed to increasing government debt and high interest rates, was largely shrugged off by investors who proceeded to buy bonds, which drove yields down from their session highs. This event echoes a similar market reaction in April when proposed tariffs caused financial instability, prompting the Trump administration to ease back on the measures. Long-term Treasury yields are closely tied to loans for houses and credit cards, and this development could have implications for those rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, allowing potential deportations to proceed while legal challenges continue. This decision reverses a lower court's order that had prevented the administration from ending these protections, which allowed Venezuelans to work and live in the United States without fear of deportation. The government argued that the lower court's intervention undermined the Executive Branch's authority over immigration and foreign affairs. Critics like Ahilan Arulanantham described the action as the largest single stripping of immigration status in modern U.S. history, predicting severe humanitarian and economic consequences.</p>

          <p>Park staff in Yellowstone National Park were forced to trap and kill a 400-pound grizzly bear after it repeatedly accessed human food near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area, and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot. The 11-year-old male grizzly had learned to overturn bear-resistant dumpsters, some weighing 800 pounds, and pull trash cans from their concrete bases in search of garbage. Park officials emphasized that while they go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food, sometimes a bear outsmarts their defenses, necessitating removal for public safety. The last similar incident occurred in 2017, and grizzly bears are protected as a threatened species in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Authorities are continuing their search for seven inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail through a hole behind a toilet, with officials increasing the reward for information leading to their capture. The escape, which Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry called the worst in recent state history, has prompted an audit of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office and the suspension of three jail staff members. The inmates, facing charges including aggravated assault and murder, are considered dangerous, and authorities believe they may be receiving assistance from the public. The escape has drawn scrutiny, with questions raised about the time it took for officials to discover the escape and alert police.</p>

          <p>After an 11-week blockade, Israel has permitted a small amount of UN humanitarian aid, including baby food, into Gaza, a move welcomed by the UN as merely "a drop in the ocean" of what is needed for the territory's 2.1 million residents facing potential famine. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited pressure from U.S. senators as the reason for allowing this "minimal" food supply, while insisting on establishing Israeli-controlled aid distribution hubs under a U.S.-backed plan. This decision has faced criticism from both right-wing Israeli politicians and humanitarian organizations, as Israeli forces continue military operations in Gaza, reportedly killing dozens and displacing thousands more.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms, according to his office. Despite the advanced stage, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective treatment options that Biden and his family are currently reviewing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in American men, with diagnosis rates increasing since 2014. Experts emphasize the importance of early screening for successful treatment, noting that many symptoms may also be due to an enlarged prostate, a common condition among older men.</p>

McMahon's departure follows the resignation of "60 Minutes" executive producer Bill Owens, who opposed settling with Trump and felt increasing scrutiny from Paramount Global, CBS's parent company, compromised journalistic independence.

The ruling asserts that President Trump exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally attempting to disband the USIP, a think tank supporting the executive and legislative branches. Judge Beryl Howell criticized the administration's use of law enforcement to forcibly take over the agency, calling it a "gross usurpation of power" that traumatized USIP employees.

          <p>Mortgage rates have risen sharply, crossing back over 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan hit 7.04%, the highest level since April 11, as bond yields increased following the downgrade announcement. This April surge in mortgage rates impacted the housing market, causing it to pull back during the busy spring season, with pending home sales dropping 3.2% compared to last year. Experts suggest that any further rate increases will likely disqualify some potential buyers and slow down the market, as buyers have recently slowed down whenever the rate goes over that 7% threshold.

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging the use of nationwide injunctions, which are issued by district-court judges, arguing they are unconstitutional and should only apply to individual parties. This effort is seen as an attempt to undermine the rule of law and limit the ability of courts to check the executive branch's power. Critics argue that restricting nationwide injunctions would allow the federal government to violate constitutional rights until each individual files a lawsuit, placing a heavy burden on those whose rights are at stake.

          <p>A new report from First Street indicates that climate change is becoming an increasingly important factor in assessing credit score risk for home mortgages. With climate disasters increasing in frequency and cost, lenders are paying closer attention to the potential impact of flood, wildfire, and wind on property values and the ability of homeowners to repay their loans. In a severe-weather year, annualized climate-driven foreclosures could result in significant bank losses, potentially increasing to $5.36 billion in ten years. As a result, a consumer's credit score could fall or rise depending on the climate risk to their property, affecting borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>
