          <p>The Trump administration plans to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students at U.S. universities, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, escalating the ongoing dispute with Harvard. This move aligns with the administration's broader crackdown on student visas. The Department of Justice has requested a delay in a ruling that challenges President Trump's tariff policy, arguing it could lead to a "foreign policy disaster scenario" and weaken the president's leverage in trade negotiations. The situation has created uncertainty and anxiety among Chinese students hoping to study in the United States, as they face potential visa revocations and stricter scrutiny. The article highlights the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China and the impact on international students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) this June, considering the current economic climate and Federal Reserve policies. While long-term CDs typically offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY), short-term CDs are currently providing the highest interest rates due to market uncertainty. Professionals recommend that individuals assess their financial goals and liquidity needs before deciding between short-term and long-term CDs, as early withdrawal penalties apply. A CD ladder strategy, involving investments in CDs with varying maturity dates, may be useful for navigating the changing interest rate environment (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a U.S. court blocked President Trump's tariffs, experts suggest the administration has several tools at its disposal to work around the ruling. Goldman Sachs economists note that while the ruling blocks the 10% baseline tariff, the Trump administration could utilize Section 122 of U.S. trade law or launch Section 301 investigations. Legal experts also point to the possibility of broadening Section 232 tariffs and pursuing Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930. The Trump administration's swift appeal of the ruling indicates the government's determination to maintain its tariff policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on processing certain immigration applications, offering relief to immigrants from various countries. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law. The pause affected 240,000 Ukrainians and 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the U.S. under Biden-era parole policies, preventing them from obtaining other forms of legal status. The Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman stated that the administration believes the law favors their position.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's criticism of House Republicans' tax bill has frustrated some GOP lawmakers, who argue he lacks understanding of congressional processes. Musk stated that the legislation "undermines the work" done by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and increases the budget deficit. Republican supporters of the bill contend that the spending cuts Musk seeks cannot be achieved through the reconciliation process, which primarily deals with mandatory government funding. Some Republicans defended the bill, arguing it provides tax relief for middle-class families, while fiscal hawks rallied around Musk's concerns about the federal deficit.</p>

          <p>Best Buy has lowered its full-year sales and profit guidance, citing increased costs from higher tariffs on consumer electronics. The company has already raised prices on some items to offset the impact of tariffs, with changes taking effect by mid-May. CEO Corie Barry emphasized that price hikes are a last resort after other cost-cutting measures are exhausted. The company's mix of imports has shifted, with China now accounting for 30% to 35% of its merchandise compared to 55% in March, while a larger percentage comes from the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the court's decision to strike down almost all of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law, not a judicial coup.

The ruling affirms Congress's power over tariffs, and Americans need not fear a judicial dictatorship, as Congress can reinstate the tariffs if it chooses.

However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a market the company estimates could be worth $50 billion. CEO Jensen Huang expressed concerns that these restrictions are encouraging Chinese AI developers to use homegrown chips. Looking ahead, Nvidia sees significant potential in AI inference, where its GPUs are used to serve AI models to millions of customers, and the company's latest Blackwell chips are designed to meet this surging demand.</p>

          <p>Lincoln Center has unveiled a $335 million plan to overhaul Damrosch Park, aiming to improve the aging site and open it up to the surrounding neighborhood. The renovation will include a new amphitheater, tiered gardens, and a pool, responding to community desires expressed during meetings with West Siders. The plan seeks to rectify the impact of urban renewal efforts by Robert Moses, which displaced a largely Black, Afro-Caribbean, and Puerto Rican neighborhood called San Juan Hill. The project aims to make the arts complex more accessible and integrate it better with the neighborhood.</p>

Observers suggest that the decision may be related to ongoing US-China tariff war talks, internal reshuffles, and reduced interest in the "Western-centric" security dialogue.

Analysts noted that the court ruling suggested that extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen, reducing uncertainty. However, White House officials conveyed that they had other avenues for pursuing tariffs, indicating continued volatility in the market.</p>

          <p>After a U.S. court blocked President Trump's tariffs, trade partners reacted cautiously, anticipating continued chaos despite the potential for relief. The ruling, while offering a fragile chance at reprieve, did not roll back sector-specific tariffs or forestall future tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Experts suggest that the Trump administration could find other legal routes to enact tariffs, potentially leading to further investigations into trading partners. Some officials expressed hope that the court challenge would pressure U.S. counterparts to be more reasonable in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse caused a landslide that buried 90% of the village of Blatten, Switzerland, with a 64-year-old man remaining missing. Authorities had evacuated the village earlier this month as a precaution, but the landslide sent mud and rocks down the mountainside, submerging homes and buildings. A large chunk of the Birch Glacier broke off, also burying the nearby Lonza River bed, raising the possibility of dammed water flows. The Swiss government has requested the army to provide clearing equipment and pumps to secure the riverbed.</p>

          <h2>Youth Lawsuit Claims Trump's Anti-Environment Orders Violate Right to Life</h2>

          <p>Twenty-two young Americans have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its anti-environment executive orders, claiming they violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty. The lawsuit alleges that the administration is intentionally boosting oil and gas production and stymying carbon-free energy, breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health. The plaintiffs, between the ages of seven and 25, hail from climate-impacted states and argue that the orders increase emissions and suppress climate research. The youth plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the three executive orders unconstitutional and block their implementation.</p>
