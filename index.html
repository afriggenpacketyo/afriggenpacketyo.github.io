          <p>Senate Democrats reportedly sought the release of several billion dollars in previously approved government funds in exchange for confirming a slate of President Trump's nominees. The negotiations, led by Senator Chuck Schumer, involved funds for health initiatives and international aid. However, the deal ultimately collapsed after President Trump rejected the terms, leading to a stalemate and sharp criticism from both sides. The remaining nominations will now be delayed until the Senate reconvenes in September.</p>

          <p>In an effort to prevent the passage of a new congressional map favoring Republicans, a group of more than 50 Democratic state legislators have left Texas to break the legislative quorum. This move aims to run out the clock on the 30-day special session called by the governor. The proposed maps could create up to five new GOP seats, and the walkout mirrors similar tactics used by Texas Democrats in previous years to stall legislation. Lawmakers who break quorum face potential daily fines and arrest upon their return to the state.</p>

Police and medics responded to the incident on Saturday night but were unable to save him. The band expressed their shock and sadness, offering condolences to the fan's family and friends. The performance was part of the band's highly anticipated reunion tour, with seven sold-out shows scheduled at the 90,000-capacity venue.

Khalid faces charges of conspiracy to commit criminal damage and entering a prohibited place. Four others were previously charged with similar offenses, as the government continues its crackdown on the group's activities targeting arms companies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has announced that new tariff rates on dozens of trading partners are "pretty much set" following a recent executive order from President Trump. The order imposes a baseline 10% tariff on all imports starting August 7, with higher rates for specific countries like Canada, which faces a 35% tariff on certain goods. Greer indicated that further negotiations are unlikely, framing the tariffs as a tool to reduce the trade deficit and fix unfavorable trade terms. The move has created uncertainty, with economists predicting a slowdown in economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite previous public statements from White House officials, Trump administration attorneys have denied in a court filing that a daily quota for immigration arrests exists. Reports in May suggested that officials were pushing for a goal of 3,000 arrests per day, a figure White House adviser Stephen Miller also mentioned on television. The government's new filing, part of a lawsuit in California, claims that while the figure was discussed as a potential goal, no such policy or directive was ever issued to ICE. This discrepancy has drawn scrutiny amid the administration's broader push for mass deportations.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The quake, which occurred Saturday night, caused brief shaking and a loud boom that startled residents across the region, though no significant damage or injuries were reported. This event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in April 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while such events are uncommon on the East Coast, they are not unexpected and this minor tremor is not a cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a thrilling conclusion, with the outcome hanging in the balance. Chasing a record 374 runs, England needs just 35 more with four wickets remaining after rain and bad light stopped play on a tense fourth day. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's seamers saw three quick wickets fall, creating a grandstand finish. The result of this single session of play will decide if England wins the series 3-1 or if India secures a 2-2 draw.</p>
