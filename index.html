          <p>Donald Trump's job approval rating has reached a record low for any president in the past 80 years at the 100-day mark, with only 39% of Americans approving of his performance. A majority of voters disapprove of many of his policies, and there are widespread fears of a recession due to his economic policies. Despite the low approval, people trust him over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems. The poll highlights deep partisan divisions and concerns about Trump's actions regarding the rule of law and government overreach.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students as a measure to alleviate the country's unaffordable housing crisis, a move that signals a significant shift in its approach to international education.
