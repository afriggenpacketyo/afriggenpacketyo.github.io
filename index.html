          <p>The cryptocurrency company Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the exchange at approximately $3.3 billion. This pricing exceeded the anticipated range, indicating strong investor demand despite the company reporting significant financial losses in recent years. A substantial portion of the shares offered will be reserved for retail investors through various trading platforms, and the stock will trade on the Nasdaq. The move is seen as a test for the crypto IPO market, especially following a recent Nasdaq investment in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An extensive manhunt is underway for the suspect who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. Authorities believe the shooter is a college-aged male who used a high-powered, bolt-action rifle, which has since been recovered from a nearby wooded area. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward and has released images of a person of interest, treating the shooting as a targeted attack. Investigators have tracked the suspect's movements, stating he fired a single shot from a building rooftop before fleeing the campus.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to over 27 years in prison after finding him guilty of leading a military coup plot. The court ruled he orchestrated a conspiracy to unlawfully remain in power following his 2022 election defeat, a plan that culminated in his supporters storming government buildings. The verdict, which also convicted seven co-conspirators including senior military officials, has drawn criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, is expected to appeal the sentence.</p>

          <p>On the 24th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and in the shadow of Charlie Kirk's assassination, members of Congress from both parties identified domestic terrorism as the nation's most pressing threat. Republicans specifically linked the killing to left-wing rhetoric, while Democrats also highlighted the broader rise of violent extremism and the increasing danger faced by public figures. The article reveals a bipartisan consensus on the severity of the threat, even as the political blame for its origins remains sharply divided along party lines.</p>

          <p>Several NATO members are deploying additional troops, artillery, and air defense systems to Poland after multiple Russian drones were shot down within Polish airspace. Poland condemned the event as an unprecedented provocation and has requested a session of the UN Security Council. In response, allies including the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Germany, and France have pledged military support to secure NATO's eastern flank. The incident significantly escalates tensions in the region, occurring as Russia and Belarus begin major joint military exercises.</p>

          <p>A neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles is grappling with a severe public health crisis caused by the persistent illegal dumping of rotten produce. Local business owners and unhoused residents report that trucks regularly discard spoiled fruits and vegetables on Naomi Avenue, attracting swarms of flies and unusually large rats. Despite numerous complaints filed through the city's official app, residents say the response has been ineffective, leaving them to contend with the foul and hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a wide-ranging bribery scheme. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury vehicle in exchange for her husband's political influence. While the judge acknowledged her ongoing cancer treatment by setting a 2026 surrender date, he also described her as a "central participant" in the corruption, not merely an innocent bystander.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump and other conservatives are promoting a misleading narrative by exclusively blaming the left for political violence following Charlie Kirk's assassination. The author cites data indicating that far-right extremists have been responsible for the majority of domestic terrorism in recent decades and points to Trump's own rhetoric as a contributing factor. The piece critiques the president for selectively ignoring right-wing violence in order to frame the issue for his own political advantage.</p>

          <p>In an internal meeting, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella conceded that the company's leadership must work to rebuild trust with its employees. His remarks were a direct response to an employee's question about a perceived decline in empathy following recent mass layoffs and a new mandate for a partial return to office work. While acknowledging the company's strong financial performance, Nadella recognized that such changes can damage the social contract with staff and that difficult work lies ahead to mend relations.</p>
