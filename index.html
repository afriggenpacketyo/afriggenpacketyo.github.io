          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has expressed significant worry that the country may need an International Monetary Fund bailout, similar to the 1976 sterling crisis. She stated that key economic indicators are pointing in this direction, citing rising borrowing costs and insufficient economic growth under the current Labour government. Badenoch has offered to work with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to cut welfare spending, arguing it is necessary to escape a "doom loop" of high taxes and unstable public finances. Labour has dismissed her concerns and criticized the offer, pointing to the economic instability that occurred under the previous Conservative government.</p>

In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index fell sharply and the rupiah weakened after President Prabowo Subianto unexpectedly replaced the finance minister. Meanwhile, markets in South Korea and Hong Kong saw gains, tracking positive momentum from the U.S. Nasdaq's record close. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France is facing a deepening political crisis after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou and his centrist government were ousted in a no-confidence vote. The collapse was triggered by a failure to secure support for 2026 budget plans aimed at cutting the nation's significant deficit. President Emmanuel Macron must now appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, facing difficult options that include forming another minority government or calling a risky snap election. The ongoing instability raises concerns about France's ability to implement fiscal consolidation, with credit rating agency Fitch set to release an update on the economy soon.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the immediate evacuation of Gaza City, warning of a significant escalation of force as it continues its operations against Hamas. The directive has caused widespread panic among the city's one million residents, many of whom have been displaced multiple times and have nowhere safe to go. This development occurs as a dispute arose over an incident involving a Gaza-bound aid flotilla docked in Tunisia; organizers claimed a drone attack, while Tunisian authorities stated a fire broke out on the vessel itself.

Phillipson, positioning herself as a "proud working-class woman from the North East," emphasized her experience in combating the political threat posed by Reform UK. The contest has a tight three-day window for candidates to secure the necessary 80 MP nominations, a timeline criticized by some within the party as unfair.</p>

          <p>At a recent virtual summit, India urged its fellow BRICS members—Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa—to address the significant trade deficits it holds with them. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted that India's largest trade imbalances are with its BRICS partners, particularly a record $99.21 billion deficit with China in the last fiscal year. This call for rebalancing comes as the bloc collectively opposes US tariffs, though India's focus remains primarily economic, in contrast to the more geopolitical outlook of China and Russia. The summit saw other members, like Brazil and China, take stronger stances against what they described as US protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>

It contends that by labeling historical exhibits and educational curricula that highlight minority experiences as "divisive," these movements seek to create a narrowed, "patriotic" narrative. This reframing, the author suggests, provides the ideological justification for policies that erode democratic rights, such as mass deportations or the dismantling of diversity initiatives.

          <h2>Apple Prepares to Launch New iPhone Amid Potential Price Hikes Due to Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its new iPhone lineup amid speculation that prices could increase due to the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The new models, expected to be named iPhone 17, still face tariffs of around 25% as they are manufactured in China and India, despite pressure from Washington to move production to the U.S. Analysts suggest prices could rise by $50 to $100 on some models to protect Apple's profit margins. The launch comes as Apple faces pressure to innovate in AI, with some promised features delayed, contributing to a lag in its stock performance compared to other tech giants.

          <p>England's football team, under new coach Thomas Tuchel, faces its most significant test yet in a World Cup qualifier against Serbia in Belgrade. Despite a perfect record of four wins and no goals conceded against weaker opponents, England's performances have been criticized as uninspired. The match will take place in the notoriously intense Rajko Mitic Stadium, providing a stern test of the team's character and tactical progress under Tuchel. A victory would put England in a commanding position in their qualifying group, but Serbia, featuring talented players like Dusan Vlahovic, presents a formidable challenge on home soil.</p>

          <p>China has granted a satellite mobile communication business license to state-owned telecom giant China Unicom, a significant step toward the commercial rollout of its satellite internet services. The license allows the company to offer services like direct-to-phone satellite connectivity, positioning it as a competitor to systems like SpaceX's Starlink. This move follows a new government guideline encouraging the use of low-orbit satellites to expand high-speed data services, particularly in areas like emergency and maritime communications. The development is expected to enhance the resilience of China's supply chains and foster a more competitive market in satellite communications.</p>

          <p>Russia is facing significant social challenges with the return of soldiers from the war in Ukraine, a group that includes numerous pardoned convicts with violent histories. The article highlights the case of a man freed from a murder sentence to fight, who then returned and murdered another woman, as an example of the potential risks. Experts estimate over 1.5 million Russians will have participated in the war, and their return, bearing psychological trauma, could fuel crime and instability. The Kremlin is reportedly attempting to manage this risk by creating programs to integrate veterans into leadership roles, hoping to avoid the wave of organized crime that followed the return of soldiers from Afghanistan in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Tensions are rising in UK towns like Warrington and Wigan over the government's use of hotels and houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) to accommodate asylum seekers. Some residents near asylum hotels are protesting, citing safety concerns and feelings of unfairness, and are demanding their closure. However, in other areas where asylum seekers are housed in HMOs, there are different concerns about community impact, intimidation, and a lack of consultation. As the government plans to close all asylum hotels, experts warn this could increase pressure on the private rental market and shift the problem to deprived areas with cheap housing, potentially exacerbating local tensions.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to commission its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a nearly $5 billion hydropower project funded primarily through domestic bonds and public donations after major international lenders declined to participate. The project has been a source of national pride but also significant controversy, including unconfirmed reports of thousands of deaths during its 14-year construction. Downstream nations Egypt and Sudan remain deeply concerned that the dam will severely reduce their water supplies from the Nile River, and years of negotiations have failed to produce a water-sharing agreement.

          <p>Police in New Zealand have located the three children of Tom Phillips, a fugitive father who had been on the run with them for nearly four years. The discovery came after Phillips was killed in a shootout with police during an attempted burglary; one of his children was with him at the time and helped lead authorities to the other two at a remote campsite. Phillips disappeared with the children in 2021 after losing legal custody. Authorities found firearms at the campsite and stated the children, who are now safe, had been put in harm's way and will require significant time to recover from their ordeal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an enhanced immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz," which it says will target "criminal illegal aliens." The move has drawn sharp criticism from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who stated they received no prior notice and accused the Trump administration of using the operation to stoke fear rather than genuinely fighting crime. Mayor Johnson expressed opposition to "militarized immigration enforcement," citing ICE's track record of alleged human rights abuses. The announcement follows a social media post from President Trump invoking the "smell of deportations in the morning."</p>

Baig alleges these flaws violate a 2020 privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Meta has disputed the allegations, stating that Baig was dismissed for poor performance and that his claims misrepresent the company's security efforts.</p>
