            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off as investors fled the safe haven asset amid turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, raising questions about who is selling and why. Some analysts suggest China may be weaponizing its Treasury holdings, while others point to Japanese life insurers reducing exposure due to policy uncertainty. The sell-off occurred despite mounting recession fears, which typically drive investors towards the safety of U.S. debt. The situation highlights the complex interplay of trade policy, investor sentiment, and global economic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Oil giant BP is being discussed as a prime takeover target, with Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron mentioned as potential suitors. BP's recent strategic reset, focusing on oil and gas while reducing renewable spending, has reignited speculation about a merger with Shell. Analysts cite potential antitrust concerns and Shell's capital discipline as possible obstacles. Exxon Mobil and Chevron could also be interested, particularly if Chevron's pursuit of Hess falls through. (not investment advice)</p>
