San Diego, who was found using an alias in North Wales, faces federal charges for maliciously damaging property with explosives, though no injuries were reported in the original attacks.

          <p>Taiwan is rapidly advancing its long-range strike capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in close collaboration with the United States. These "suicide drones," which are derivatives of the MQM-178 system, are reportedly designed with a range of at least 1,000km, positioning them as a strategic asset capable of striking deep inside mainland China, including major cities. This innovative "high-low" strategy aims to provide an affordable and effective alternative to more expensive cruise missiles, with the system slated for its debut at an upcoming Taipei defense exhibition.

          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are preparing for a stunning spectacle this evening as a total lunar eclipse, commonly known as a "Blood Moon," is set to turn the full Moon a deep red. This astronomical phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, blocking direct sunlight and casting a shadow, while red light is refracted through Earth's atmosphere. While the full eclipse begins at 18:30, visibility in the UK will vary based on moonrise times, with eastern parts enjoying the longest view. Dr. Edward Bloomer of the Royal Observatory Greenwich emphasizes that this event offers a unique and tangible demonstration of the solar system's mechanics.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Simon Tisdall argues that international leaders, including India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron, have repeatedly learned that attempting to curry favor with Donald Trump often leads to unfavorable outcomes. The author contends that Trump's relationships are inherently personal and impermanent, driven by his ego rather than consistent strategic interests. Britain's Keir Starmer is cautioned against adopting a similar "Trump-whisperer" approach ahead of a state visit, as it has yielded little benefit at high reputational cost for others. The piece advocates for a stance of firm resolve and the exploration of alternative diplomatic options when engaging with the former US President, suggesting that resistance proves more effective than deference.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes key UK newspaper headlines, reporting that the new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, plans to announce within weeks a move for asylum seekers from hotels into barracks on former military bases. The Sunday Times suggests that the cabinet is prepared to overhaul human rights laws to counter the influence of Nigel Farage, even if it causes discomfort among some Labour MPs. Additionally, HMRC faces criticism for failing to answer millions of phone calls from businesses, leading to a "staggering" £47bn shortfall in collected taxes. The news also briefly touches on England's underwhelming football victory.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the powerful energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. By rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, water droplets on the surface boil, triggering the formation of vapor bubbles that suddenly collapse, generating a strong force capable of launching jumpers 1.5 meters into the air. This precise technique allows scientists to control how and where these small pieces of material launch from a wet surface, and even enables them to swim in water. This article highlights a significant scientific advancement in robotics and micro-propulsion technology with diverse potential applications.</p>
