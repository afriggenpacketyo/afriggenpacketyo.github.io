        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, in collaboration with Florida state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 undocumented immigrants in a statewide operation. The targeted individuals had final deportation orders. This operation marks the first formal arrangement with state law enforcement under a 287(g) agreement. The move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to accelerate deportations, which have been below the administration's stated goals. The operation spanned four days and represents the latest in a series of raids across the United States conducted in partnership with various federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, survivors and their families gathered to remember the horrors and commemorate the lives lost. British and Canadian troops liberated the camp in April 1945, discovering thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Bergen-Belsen differed from death camps like Auschwitz as it lacked gas chambers; instead, overcrowding, disease, and starvation caused the deaths of tens of thousands, including Anne Frank. The camp serves as a chilling reminder of Nazi cruelty and the suffering endured by Jews, Soviet prisoners of war, Sinti, homosexuals, and others during the Holocaust.</p>

The Rams are expected to make another deep playoff run this season, and their savvy draft strategy positions them for continued success in the coming years, including Super Bowl LXI at SoFi Stadium.

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system is facing a crisis due to inadequate government funding, leading to worker shortages, longer wait times, and rising costs for patients. Many Australians are delaying or forgoing necessary care, and health has become a key issue in the upcoming election. Both major parties have pledged additional funding, but experts argue that sweeping reforms are needed to address the systemic issues.
