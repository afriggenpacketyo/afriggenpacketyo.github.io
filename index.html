          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to Donald Trump, strongly criticized an appeals court decision that ruled most of the former president's tariffs illegal. Navarro described the ruling as "weaponized partisan injustice" and claimed that if the Supreme Court upholds it, it would be "the end of the United States." The administration is preparing to appeal the decision, which found that Trump had overstepped his authority in invoking emergency economic powers to justify the sweeping levies. The article notes that tariff revenue is paid by American consumers, not foreign governments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court Judge issued an emergency order halting the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for takeoff, forcing officials to deplane the minors and return them to government custody. Attorneys for the children argued the deportations would be illegal, depriving them of due process and the right to seek humanitarian protection. The government contended it was repatriating the children at their families' request, a claim disputed by advocates.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asserted that while Germany hopes for a swift end to the war in Ukraine, it cannot come at the cost of Ukraine's sovereignty and independence. In an interview, Merz stated that surrendering to Russia is not a viable option, as it would endanger other nations, including Germany itself. He reaffirmed that supporting Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression remains an "absolute priority" for his government. Germany is a significant military backer of Ukraine, having provided or pledged substantial aid since the 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 at Anfield thanks to a late free-kick from Dominik Szoboszlai in a closely watched early Premier League season contest. The article suggests that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's conservative tactical approach may have cost his team a chance to make a statement against the reigning champions. Despite significant summer spending, Arsenal struggled to create scoring opportunities against a resilient Liverpool defense. The result extends Arsenal's long winless streak at Anfield and gives Liverpool an early psychological advantage in the title race.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned the Trump administration's plans for a large-scale immigration crackdown in Chicago, labeling a potential deployment of troops as an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted by federal officials and criticized the lack of coordination, which he described as dangerous and disruptive. He argued that such actions are un-American and are intended to intimidate communities, including U.S. citizens. The governor also accused the administration of having ulterior motives beyond crime fighting, possibly related to future elections.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order requiring identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that would likely face significant legal challenges. Constitutional scholars note that the authority to regulate elections primarily rests with the states and Congress, not the presidency. This push for stricter voting rules stems from Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and disabled voters, while proponents claim they are necessary to ensure election integrity.</p>

The author argues that while Trump's unpredictability could be seen as an abdication of leadership, it also presents an opportunity for a decisive policy to end the war, unlike the cautious approach of his predecessor. The piece suggests Vladimir Putin is patiently exploiting the confusion, but also notes that he respects U.S. military power.

          <p>This commentary piece argues that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles should have prevented the recent sports scandal at Bishop Montgomery High School, which resulted in the firing of its football coach. The school is facing repercussions for using ineligible transfer students and an on-field altercation, leading to a forfeited game. The author draws parallels to a similar situation at St. Bernard High in 2020, suggesting that the archdiocese failed to learn from past mistakes involving attempts to rapidly build a football program with shortcuts. The article calls for a thorough investigation into how the situation escalated without earlier intervention.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This agreement strengthens the NATO northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 advanced anti-submarine frigates. The partnership represents a significant strategic and industrial victory for the UK over competing bids from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not received the vaccination against the illness during pregnancy. This tragic event underscores government warnings about declining vaccine uptake and the dangers of the bacterial infection for very young babies. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their own first jab at eight weeks old. The case serves as a stark reminder of the severity of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

The UN condemned the arbitrary detention of its staff and is seeking more information from local authorities.

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore addressed his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump, stating he has "no interest in fighting with the president, but I have an interest in fighting for my communities." The dispute began after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard, an offer Moore described as "performative." While acknowledging the city's challenges, Moore touted recent progress in reducing crime and criticized the president's "arrogant criticism and cynicism." He also defended his military record against Trump's attacks, calling it a debate the president should "sit out."</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers brainstormed new ways to support Ukraine, including the possibility of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners. Another novel proposal involves inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" for its defense industry. Discussions also revisited the controversial idea of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv, a move some member states fear could be illegal and destabilize markets.

          <p>The highly anticipated Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic ended in a lackluster 0-0 draw, described in this analysis as one of the worst in recent memory. The article notes that while Rangers showed fight and organization, a positive for their beleaguered manager, their attack was ineffective. Celtic's performance was particularly criticized as "powder-puff," with the team failing to create any significant scoring chances and looking creatively barren. The result leaves both clubs with significant questions to address, particularly Celtic, whose attacking inability was starkly exposed in the goalless stalemate.</p>

          <p>An article from The Economist examines the increasing attention Donald Trump is directing towards America's public universities, framing it as a new front in the culture wars. The piece reflects on the recent campus protests over the war in Gaza, which have drawn conservative criticism and fueled calls for reform in higher education. This focus on universities aligns with a broader political strategy of challenging institutions perceived as bastions of liberal ideology. The tranquil summer campus at UCLA is presented as a stark contrast to the political turmoil brewing around the future of public higher education.</p>

President Prabowo Subianto announced the reversal, which includes reducing a controversial new monthly allowance that had angered the public. The protests, which have at times turned violent, were fueled by multiple issues but crystallized around perceptions of political entitlement. While making this concession, the president also warned that he has ordered security forces to take strong action against looting and property damage, labeling some protest activities as "treason."</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. The Bay Foundation led an effort over 13 years, employing divers to smash nearly 6 million voracious purple sea urchins that had decimated the kelp. This allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to regrow across 80 acres, restoring critical habitat for over 800 species and improving water quality. The project's success, turning barren sea floors back into thriving underwater forests, serves as a potential model for other coastal regions where kelp is struggling.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party, if elected, will remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. The plan aims to "maximize extraction" by scrapping the need for producers to reduce emissions or invest in carbon storage technologies. Badenoch claims that current net zero measures are a burden that ultimately leads to higher energy bills for consumers. The policy marks a significant shift in climate policy and stands in stark contrast to the current Labour government's commitment to banning new exploration licenses.</p>
