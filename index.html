            <p>China's economy is facing increasing deflationary pressures as consumer prices continue to decline and producer price deflation deepens, signaling potential challenges for Chinese exporters amid escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The consumer price index contracted for the second consecutive month, while producer prices fell for the 29th straight month, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Despite these challenges, the Chinese government is considering further stimulus measures focused on boosting domestic consumption, including increased subsidies for consumer trade-in programs, to offset the impact of rising tariffs. These measures aim to achieve the country's ambitious growth target of around 5% amid ongoing trade uncertainties (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Former England striker Eni Aluko has spoken out after winning the first stage of a High Court libel claim against ex-footballer Joey Barton, stating that she hopes the judgment will make people think twice about online behavior. Aluko said she should not have to be anxious that her race and gender would be attacked every time she was on TV. The judge ruled Barton's comments were defamatory by meaning or innuendo. Aluko hopes the finding will encourage others to speak out about online abuse and that there is a double standard held for her, sometimes a triple standard held for her as a black women, if she says anything.</p>

            <p>Robert King, a 35-year-old Texas man, has been ordered to remain in jail after being charged with making online threats against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

A judge deemed him a flight risk and a risk to the community, despite his attorney's argument about his mental health issues. The threats came to light through the FBI tip line, and King was living with his sister and brother-in-law, a police officer and former Customs and Border Protection agent, at the time of the incidents.</p>

            <p>England is preparing for local elections that, while lacking the glamour of a general election, hold significant implications for local services and national politics. Voters in various parts of England will elect councillors and mayors, testing support for major parties like the Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats. The elections serve as a barometer of national sentiment, with results closely watched for insights into the government's performance and potential shifts in the political landscape. Issues such as local authority finances, rising council tax bills, and the quality of local services are expected to influence voter decisions.</p>

The tariffs could lead to soaring inflation, lower interest rates, stock market listing delays, and increased corruption.

            <p>Analysts are cautioning that President Donald Trump's decision to temporarily pause tariffs on most nations, while escalating tariffs on China, does not signal a shift in his overall trade objectives and that further market volatility is expected.

Despite the temporary pause, analysts emphasize that the threat of higher tariffs from Trump will persist, creating ongoing uncertainty for businesses and investors. A report by ING noted that current tariffs on Chinese products could provide tax revenue of US$835 billion, calling the current situation “not only chaotic, [but] crazy.” (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The port of Duluth-Superior, a logistical and engineering wonder located in the northernmost part of the United States, serves as a frontline in the global trade war. Vast ocean-going vessels are loaded and unloaded with products essential to the global economy, such as iron ore, cement, and grain. The port, which supports over 7,000 jobs and generates $1.6 billion annually, faces increased unpredictability due to tariffs. Farmers in the region, who overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, express anxiety about the potential long-term impact on their livelihoods (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate two senior officials from his first administration who became critics: Miles Taylor and Christopher Krebs. Taylor, who wrote an anonymous op-ed and a tell-all book critical of Trump, is accused of "treason." Krebs, who served as Trump's election security director, was fired for correcting claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The directives mark Trump's first formal orders to investigate political enemies, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

            <p>A group of MPs is calling for a streaming levy, where streaming services pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences. The report by the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content. Industry figures are worried that the next potential hit UK shows like Adolescence won’t get made without the right kind of investment. The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK (not investment advice).</p>
