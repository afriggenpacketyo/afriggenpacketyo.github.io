          <p>Over 3,200 Boeing defense unit employees have commenced a strike, marking their first work stoppage since 1996, after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 stated that the proposed deal, which included a 20% wage increase and a $5,000 bonus, did not adequately reflect their members' skills and critical role in national defense. Boeing's CEO previously downplayed the potential impact, despite the defense unit contributing significantly to the company's revenue. This action follows a larger commercial aircraft worker strike last year, highlighting ongoing labor tensions within the company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany plans to implement an increase in the "mother's pension" by January 1, 2027, a year earlier than initially scheduled, despite a significant federal budget gap. This third-step increase adds approximately €20 per child per month for children born before 1992, aiming to equalize benefits with those born later. While the Christian Social Union (CSU) hails it as a benefit for 10 million women, critics argue the €5 billion annual cost is poorly targeted and fails to address the broader gender pension gap or poverty among the elderly. Experts suggest more effective measures like better childcare are needed.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK car finance customers may be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, expected to begin payouts in 2026, advising consumers against using claims companies for now. Eligibility largely depends on whether customers were treated "fairly," particularly those with banned discretionary commission arrangements. Individuals can check their contracts or await the FCA's scheme, which will include a consultation in October. This article provides crucial guidance for those potentially affected by mis-sold car finance.</p>

          <p>Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," chronicles the dramatic upheaval of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which led to the deposition of Iran's reigning monarch. The article highlights how the book explores the pivotal role played by blunders from American policymakers in shaping the outcome of this transformative event. This historical account sheds light on the complex shift from an allied relationship to one of animosity between the United States and Iran. The book provides a detailed narrative of the revolution's impact on diplomatic ties.</p>

Despite government claims of legal action for redress, villagers demand their original lands back, expressing skepticism about alternative plots or compensation.

          <p>Authorities in Idaho have released a detailed 3D replica of the house where Bryan Kohberger murdered four University of Idaho students, following his guilty plea. Kohberger accepted four consecutive life sentences without parole for the murders and one count of felony burglary, avoiding the death penalty. The 3D model, originally intended for the canceled trial, provides a virtual walkthrough of the torn-down residence, though unfurnished. Investigative documents released after the gag order lift revealed details like the victims being found together under a blood-covered blanket, and evidence of a struggle. This article offers a glimpse into the crime scene through forensic technology.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, becoming the latter's first PCC. Matthews, who was re-elected in May 2024, stated that the "dark heart of wokeness" needed to be removed from the criminal justice system and criticized both Conservative and Labour governments for failing the country. This defection is seen as another local government milestone for Reform UK, solidifying their base and adding to the perception of a fraying Conservative Party at the local level. Critics from both major parties have condemned the move.</p>

First Minister John Swinney praised her "invaluable contribution to public life" over the past decade. Her departure, along with over 20 other SNP MSPs, is seen as a "hammer blow" to Swinney's government, as she was considered one of the Scottish Parliament's brightest talents.</p>

Unlike previous trends, Labubu is openly displayed, challenging historical US views of adult "cuteness" as regressive. This trend reflects a changing perception of adulthood, with more people rejecting rigid norms and finding joy in playful expression.

          <p>Tesla has granted CEO Elon Musk $29 billion worth of shares, aiming to retain him after a US court invalidated his 2018 pay package, valued at over $50 billion. The company's board expressed confidence this new award will incentivize Musk, especially amid an intensifying "war for AI talent." This move seeks to boost Musk's voting power and signals Tesla's pivot towards becoming an AI and robotics-focused company. The award is contingent on the Delaware court not reinstating the original 2018 deal, which Musk is currently appealing.</p>

          <p>Tensions are escalating in Switzerland as a looming August 7 deadline for a trade agreement with the US threatens 39% duties on Swiss imports. This high tariff rate, surprisingly imposed under President Trump's new trade policy, has shocked Swiss officials and business leaders. Despite a recent phone call between leaders yielding no agreement, Switzerland intends to continue negotiations, possibly beyond the deadline, with a new "attractive offer." Industry groups warn of severe economic fallout and job losses, highlighting the critical importance of the US market for Swiss exports.</p>

The series saw a record 7,187 runs scored in a five-Test match, with every game extending to the final day, a rarity in modern cricket.

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a dip after the conglomerate reported a 4% year-over-year decline in second-quarter operating earnings, totaling $11.16 billion. The dip was primarily attributed to a drop in insurance underwriting profits, despite gains in other sectors. Investors were also disappointed by the company's continued stock-selling spree, dumping $4.5 billion in equities, and the absence of any stock repurchases, even as shares corrected. The article notes a significant $3.8 billion write-down for Berkshire's Kraft Heinz stake, reflecting past overpayment and increased competition in the branded food category.</p>

          <p>The article warns high earners about a potential "SALT torpedo" — an artificially high federal tax rate of 45.5% — affecting those with modified adjusted gross income between $500,000 and $600,000 under President Trump's new tax legislation. This occurs due to a phaseout of the increased $40,000 federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). Financial experts advise managing unexpected income and considering strategies like opting for ETFs over mutual funds in taxable accounts to limit year-end tax hits. Switching to pretax 401(k) contributions is also suggested to lower adjusted gross income (not investment advice).</p>

Made with flexible SBS material, these shingles undergo rigorous UL 2218 Impact Resistance Tests, with Class 4 being the highest rating. While not invincible, they significantly reduce severe damage compared to standard asphalt shingles. Though costing 10-25% more, the investment can be worthwhile, especially in storm-prone areas, as they may lead to lower future repair costs and potential insurance discounts.

Despite this, analysts predict Nvidia's AI chip market share in China will decline due to increasing competition from domestic chipmakers like Huawei, Cambricon, and Hygon. US export controls have inadvertently fostered a unique opportunity for Chinese vendors to develop advanced alternatives, leading to a projected surge in China's AI chip market localization.
