          <p>Advocacy groups are criticizing Republican plans to cut health and food benefits for low-income individuals to offset costs associated with new Trump programs and tax cuts. The proposed cuts, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill," would significantly impact Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), potentially affecting millions of Americans. According to the article, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates substantial reductions in funding for these programs, while tax cuts would largely benefit the wealthiest Americans.
