          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since the 2024 election, criticizing the Trump administration's policies, particularly the trade war. Harris described the tariffs as reckless, asserting they are hurting workers, families, and businesses by raising costs and paralyzing economic activity. She cautioned against complacency, urging Americans to stand together and defend their country's ideals. While acknowledging that the situation may worsen before it improves, she emphasized the importance of collective action and resilience. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has significantly lowered its growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. This downgrade comes alongside the BOJ's decision to hold interest rates steady, complicating its efforts to normalize monetary policy. President Trump's tariffs are weighing on Japan's economy, already struggling with weak consumer spending and inflation outpacing wage increases. The BOJ projects core prices to rise by 2.2% this fiscal year, slightly lower than previous forecasts. </p>

          <p>Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, reported that Chinese online retailers have decreased their advertising spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Trump's trade policies.

Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell below Wall Street projections, and the company anticipates headwinds to its advertising business. These comments echo similar warnings from Google and Snap about potential advertising challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
