          <p>Downing Street has affirmed its full support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves after she appeared visibly upset and tearful during a contentious session in the House of Commons. The prime minister's office stated Reeves was "going nowhere" following questions about her future amidst a government U-turn on welfare reform. The incident coincided with a dip in the pound's value and a rise in government borrowing costs, though a spokesperson for the chancellor attributed her emotional state to a private, personal matter. Colleagues from across the political spectrum expressed their well wishes for her.</p>

          <p>The B-2 bomber pilots who conducted a recent strike on Iranian nuclear facilities have been advised to maintain a low profile during their July Fourth visit to the White House. President Trump, who invited the pilots to be celebrated as heroes, has claimed the mission "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. However, for security reasons, no public ceremony is planned and the pilots' identities will not be disclosed. The visit follows a dispute over the mission's effectiveness, with initial intelligence assessments suggesting a more limited setback for Iran than the administration has publicly stated.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction, a bail hearing has been set for Sean Combs, with prosecutors and defense attorneys disagreeing on the appropriate prison sentence. Prosecutors argue for a sentence of four to five years, while the defense suggests around two years. In court filings, prosecutors are urging the judge to deny bail, citing Combs as a flight risk and a danger to the community. They presented hotel security footage of an assault on his former partner Cassie Ventura and letters from other victims, including Ventura, who expressed fear of retaliation if he is released.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven people unaccounted for, according to officials. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, triggered mandatory evacuations and sparked multiple grass fires burning approximately 80 acres. Family members of workers at the facility have gathered nearby, anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones. The blast was felt miles away, and the resulting smoke plume reached up to 15,000 feet, disrupting power for thousands and forcing nearby communities to reassess their Fourth of July fireworks shows.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported approximately 384,000 vehicle deliveries for the second quarter, a 14% decrease compared to the same period last year, marking its second straight quarterly decline. Despite the drop, the figure surpassed some analysts' lower expectations, causing the company's stock to rise. The electric vehicle maker is facing heightened competition from other manufacturers, particularly in China, and a potential brand backlash linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities. The company's sales have also been impacted by plateauing demand for electric vehicles and customer anticipation for updated models.</p>

          <p>The European Commission, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, is set to face a no-confidence vote in the European Parliament next week. The motion was initiated by a right-wing MEP who criticized a lack of transparency regarding text messages exchanged with Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for a multi-billion euro COVID-19 vaccine deal. Although the vote is largely symbolic and unlikely to pass, it highlights growing frustration within Brussels over the Commission's recent decisions. For the motion to succeed, it would need an absolute majority, which would compel the entire Commission to resign.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ruled against the Trump administration's suspension of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, stating the president exceeded his authority. Judge Randolph Moss determined that declaring an "invasion" to unilaterally ban asylum claims is unlawful and supplants immigration laws enacted by Congress. The ruling, which gives the administration 14 days to appeal, could require officials to resume processing asylum seekers. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups after the administration abruptly closed the border to legal applicants upon taking office.</p>

The warrant is tied to a probation violation for an aggravated sexual abuse charge from last year, in which he was accused of the sexual assault and strangulation of a female park employee.

          <p>The Trump administration has paused more than $6 billion in congressionally approved federal funding for a range of education programs just weeks before the new school year. According to a Department of Education memo, funding for after-school support, teacher training, and English language programs is under review and will not be disbursed on July 1. The move has sparked outrage from educators and Democratic lawmakers, who warn it will harm students and force cash-strapped school districts to make painful cuts. An administration spokesperson stated the pause is for a programmatic review of how funds are spent.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive domestic policy package, is nearing final passage in Congress. The legislation includes approximately $4.5 trillion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses, along with significant spending increases for border security, immigration enforcement, and defense. To offset these costs, the bill proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which could cause millions to lose coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add about $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>
