          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round, marking the largest private fusion investment in Europe to date. Investors are optimistic about the company's potential to develop the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, is seen as a pivotal technology for the energy transition, potentially providing virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. While some researchers remain skeptical about the timeline for commercial scalability, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade. The company believes it is well-positioned to leverage momentum in the fusion energy sector and shift global energy dependence from natural resources to technological leadership.</p>

          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and others for an unlawful investigation has been finalized. The case involved a suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment, specifically spray-drying apparatus that investigators believed could be used in biological weapons production. Okawara and two other men will receive approximately 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages after their arrests and indictments were recognized as illegal. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation, prompted by a petition with over 40,000 signatures and concerns raised by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry regarding the legal interpretation of export control rules.</p>

          <p>Shares of Zara owner Inditex experienced a decline after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to the summer season. The Spanish retailer posted revenues of 8.27 billion euros ($9.44 billion) for the fiscal first quarter, slightly below analysts' forecasts, with net income also falling short of estimates. Summer sales growth slowed to 6% compared to 12% in the same period last year, raising concerns about broader consumer sentiment and spending patterns. Inditex, which operates brands like Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti, cited uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S., its second-largest market.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, following a public disagreement between the two. The feud was sparked by Musk's disapproval of Trump's spending bill, leading to a series of exchanges on social media. Musk even considered creating a new political party during the dispute. Trump responded with threats of "serious consequences" if Musk were to fund Democrats, given the federal contracts held by Musk's companies. Musk later acknowledged that his posts "went too far."</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has indicated that the current share price of Commerzbank is too high for a potential takeover bid to be viable. UniCredit has acquired a 28% stake in Commerzbank through derivatives and has the ECB's authorization to increase its holding to 29.9%. Orcel stated that an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value would not be in the best interest of UniCredit's investors. He emphasized that UniCredit is not currently pursuing a merger bid and would seek a "constructive solution" to address opposition from the German government before considering such a move.</p>

Zelenskyy also noted the use of North Korean ballistic missiles and the spread of Russian-Iranian drone technologies to North Korea, which he described as a significant threat to Europe and Asia. Russia's Defense Ministry reported shooting down 33 Ukrainian drones, while Ukrainian officials claimed a drone strike caused a fire at an explosives plant in Russia's Tambov region.</p>

          <p>Asia is progressively reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committing to increasing the use of local currencies in trade and investment. The move is driven by concerns over the dollar's potential weaponization in trade negotiations and sanctions, leading countries to re-evaluate their U.S. dollar portfolios. This de-dollarization trend is also evident in central bank reserves and trade transactions, as Asian economies seek to mitigate foreign exchange risks by using their own currencies. Investors are increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures, further fueling demand for local and alternative currencies. (not investment advice)</p>

The article references a book titled 'Harvard Hates America' and a letter from a former congressman criticizing the perceived left-leaning bias in universities. It argues that Trump's administration's attacks on Harvard and Columbia are part of a broader, decades-long effort to undermine universities for political reasons. The article suggests that Republicans aim to counter the trend of college-educated individuals voting Democratic, and shift funding towards trade schools and vocational education.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has expressed regret over his recent criticisms of President Trump, following a social media feud between the two. President Trump has stated that he is not interested in repairing his relationship with Musk, his former adviser. The conflict stemmed from Musk's disapproval of Trump's spending bill, which led to a public exchange of words on social media platforms.</p>

          <p>India's foreign minister has expressed optimism about reaching a trade agreement with the United States before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on July 9. Trade negotiations between the two countries had already commenced before President Trump unveiled tariffs on global partners, including India. The US delegation recently held meetings with Indian trade ministry officials in Delhi, with both sides reporting productive discussions. While the US remains keen on reducing its trade deficit with India, Delhi is unlikely to offer concessions in politically sensitive sectors such as agriculture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's ambassador to China, Kenji Kanasugi, has emphasized the need for China and Japan to improve public opinion towards each other as they work to stabilize ties amid shared concerns about tariffs imposed by the US.

The relationship between Beijing and Tokyo has been strained by historical issues, territorial disputes, and China's import ban on Japanese seafood following the release of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Political friction has also deepened as Tokyo aligns more closely with Washington's efforts to contain China.</p>

The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, permitted the sterilization of people with disabilities without their consent.
