          <p>With a federal government shutdown just days away, Democratic leaders are holding firm on their demand that any short-term funding bill must include protections for health care programs, specifically the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits. Republicans have called these demands unreasonable, leading to a legislative stalemate as President Trump has backed out of negotiations. The impasse increases the likelihood of a shutdown, with both parties seemingly betting that the other will be blamed for the consequences, including a potential spike in health insurance premiums for millions.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Virginia have recommended against bringing criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey, concluding there is insufficient evidence to secure an indictment for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this, the newly appointed U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury, acting on a directive from President Trump to prosecute political adversaries. This move is being pursued against the advice of career staff, who have warned of ethical issues and DOJ policy violations, as the five-year statute of limitations is about to expire.</p>

          <p>Shares of used auto retailer CarMax plummeted by over 20% after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The company cited a challenging market, including depreciation of its inventory and a pull-ahead in sales earlier in the year, for its lackluster performance. CarMax's overall vehicle sales declined by 4.1% compared to the previous year, contributing to a significant drop in net income. The poor results have also negatively impacted the stock prices of other car retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

He stated that Ukraine possesses combat drones capable of traveling up to 3,000 kilometers, emphasizing that these attacks would be directed at military positions, not civilians. This escalation follows Ukraine's recent focus on striking Russia's energy infrastructure, which Zelenskyy described as a form of effective sanctions.</p>

As part of the settlement, Amazon must also simplify its cancellation process and provide clearer disclosures about automatic enrollment after free trials.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Merits of Long-Term Care Insurance Amid Escalating Senior Care Costs</h2>

          <p>The rising cost of senior care, with nursing homes now exceeding $120,000 per year, is prompting many to reconsider the value of long-term care insurance. This type of insurance is designed to cover services that Medicare typically does not, such as assistance with daily activities like bathing and meal preparation, which make up the bulk of long-term care needs. Experts suggest that purchasing a policy sooner is advantageous, as premiums increase with age and health issues can lead to denial of coverage. This financial planning tool can help protect retirement savings from being depleted by unpredictable and substantial healthcare expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, his critics view the sentence as long-overdue accountability for a politician who has repeatedly pushed legal boundaries. The case underscores the deep polarization in French politics, with the right decrying judicial overreach and the left seeing it as a fight against elite impunity.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Portland, Oregon, are conducting a manhunt for a 26-year-old man accused of murder who was mistakenly released from custody due to a clerical error. The suspect, Ty Anthony Sage, was freed after posting a $5,000 bail, despite a judge having previously denied him bail in connection with a 2021 robbery and shooting that killed a 15-year-old. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office has taken responsibility for the "monumental mistake," acknowledging a failure in the system. The victim's family has expressed fear and frustration over the release of their son's alleged killer.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has partly upheld complaints against the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set, ruling that it violated editorial guidelines on harm and offence. The performance, which was live-streamed on iPlayer, included a chant of "death, death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments characterized by the BBC as antisemitic. However, the unit cleared the broadcast of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime. The incident had previously drawn an apology from the BBC's director general and led to changes in how live music events are streamed.</p>

          <p>HSBC, in collaboration with IBM, has successfully used quantum computing to improve the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions in a trial hailed as a "world-first" for the financial industry. By combining classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, the bank achieved a 34% improvement in estimating the likelihood of a trade being filled at a specific price. This breakthrough demonstrates the practical application of quantum technology to solve complex financial problems in over-the-counter markets. The success suggests that quantum computing is on the verge of providing a significant competitive edge in financial services. (not investment advice)</p>

Bompastor, who led her team to a domestic treble, emphasized that while progress has been made, there is still significant room for improvement in achieving gender equality in football.</p>

          <p>American golfer Bryson DeChambeau has publicly called on Donald Trump to "inspire" the U.S. team to victory at the Ryder Cup, ahead of the former president's planned appearance at the event. DeChambeau expressed hope that Trump's presence would be a "great force" to rally support from the crowd at Bethpage Black in New York. His comments contrast with the more subdued reaction from European player Robert MacIntyre, who dismissed Trump's visit as just another spectator.

          <p>A new report from the Wall Street Journal details the Trump administration's chaotic and disorganized response to the Jeffrey Epstein files saga, which reportedly caused significant turmoil within the White House. The report alleges that President Trump was worried some of his friends might be implicated in the files and that the documents could have been doctored to harm him. The administration's handling of the issue, including a poorly received publicity event with right-wing influencers, has been described as a series of "unforced errors." High-level strategy meetings were reportedly convened in the Situation Room to manage the escalating political crisis.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have received a surprising boost as consumers rush to purchase vehicles out of fear of impending tariffs and higher prices. Cox Automotive has raised its 2025 sales forecast, citing stronger-than-expected demand driven by policy uncertainty. A recent surge in electric vehicle sales also occurred ahead of the expiration of a federal tax credit. While this "pull-ahead" effect has benefited automakers in the short term, analysts expect sales to slow in the fourth quarter and into the next year as these incentives disappear and potential tariff costs are priced in.
