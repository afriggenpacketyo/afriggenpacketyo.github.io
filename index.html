          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The remains are believed to belong to the seven individuals reported missing after the incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics. The facility was later found to be operating without the necessary local licenses on a property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. The blast caused significant damage, destroying structures, sparking grass fires, and prompting evacuations in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis of the critical threat facing the United Nations and global multilateralism due to potential deep funding cuts by the Trump administration. The US, as the UN's largest contributor, is reviewing its financial commitments, with a proposed budget seeking an 87% reduction in UN funding. Such cuts could cripple essential agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme, undermine peacekeeping missions, and hinder global efforts to address humanitarian crises. The author argues that the weakening of the UN would lead to a more dangerous and chaotic world, urging other democracies to defend the institution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 01:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that MI5's internal inquiries into providing false evidence were "deficient" and ordered a new, more robust investigation. The case centers on the agency's handling of a violent neo-Nazi informant who abused women, and MI5's subsequent attempts to cover up its actions by lying to three different courts. A BBC investigation revealed that MI5 falsely claimed it had not confirmed the agent's identity to journalists, a lie that unraveled with recorded evidence. The court found that MI5 continued to provide misleading information even during its internal review.</p>

          <p>After a lengthy trial, a Los Angeles jury has found Monica Sementilli guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors argued that she and her lover, Robert Baker, plotted the murder to collect on a life insurance policy and be together, staging the crime to look like a burglary. Key evidence included thousands of texts between the lovers, surveillance footage, and Baker's DNA found at the house. Baker pleaded no contest and was sentenced to life, while Monica Sementilli has now been sentenced to life without parole.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey that would form the basis for his book "Life on the Mississippi." The trip represented a return to the scenes of his youth, which he considered a time of ultimate freedom and independence from societal constraints. Despite his fame and the changes to the river landscape, Twain felt completely at home in the pilot house of a steamboat. This experience reinforced how his early years remained the "magical touchstone" of his life.</p>
