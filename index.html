          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run home run, his ninth of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 7-4 win against the Miami Marlins. Ohtani's homer, clocked at 117.9 mph, was the hardest-hit in MLB this season. He expressed confidence in his performance, especially homering off a great pitcher in a clutch situation. The game also saw contributions from Freddie Freeman, who hit a two-run homer, and Kim Hye Seong, who recorded his first two MLB hits.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The DOJ noted that between 2014 and June 2023, Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons, which Credit Suisse AG Singapore knew or should have known were U.S., with total assets valued at over $2 billion. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, breaching a 2014 plea agreement. Whistleblowers provided detailed evidence leading to this settlement, feeling vindicated after a decade of waiting.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, a conservative Christian Democrat, will be sworn in as Germanyâ€™s next chancellor after less than two months of negotiation between the Christian Democratic Union and the incumbent Social Democrats. Germany faces significant challenges including a slumping economy, high labor costs, failing public infrastructure, and the rise of the far-right AfD. Merz has tapped several people from the private sector for his cabinet, an unusual decision for Germany, and has included ministers not born in Germany. The new coalition government hopes to deliver political change and maintain stability amidst growing challenges.</p>

Over 64.9% of foreign visitors were from countries that are members of Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting the initiative's role in driving transaction growth.

          <p>President Trump closed a loophole that allowed cheap goods from China to enter the United States without tariffs, potentially impacting delivery companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL. The de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free imports of goods worth $800 or less, is now eliminated for goods from mainland China and Hong Kong. UPS expects a 25% decline in revenue from shipping packages from China to the U.S., its most profitable trade lane, and has announced 20,000 job cuts.

          <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom of California proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal, if approved, would represent the largest government subsidy program for the industry in the United States. This initiative comes as Hollywood has lost production to states and nations offering tax credits and cheaper labor. The move aims to strengthen domestic production and bring more filming back to the United States.</p>
