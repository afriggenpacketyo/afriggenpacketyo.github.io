          <p>Major food and beverage chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly relying on new and customized drinks to drive sales, particularly among younger consumers. This strategy focuses on cold beverages, specialty coffees, and energy drinks, which have seen significant growth on menus as consumers now often visit establishments specifically for a beverage rather than as a food add-on. While this trend presents a profitable opportunity, chains face challenges from price-sensitive customers and rising competition in the beverage space.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Mark Penn asserts that President Trump's direct diplomatic engagement with Russia and Ukraine represents an unprecedented and effective effort to end the war. The author argues that, contrary to critical media portrayals, Trump is successfully uniting European leaders behind a common goal for peace. The piece contrasts these actions with what it characterizes as the inaction of the Obama administration and the physical and mental lapses of the previous president, urging the press and public to support the current diplomatic push.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has downplayed the likelihood of an imminent meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, suggesting any such talks would require extensive preparation. This comes as U.S. President Donald Trump actively pushes for a bilateral summit to end the war in Ukraine, admitting that it is possible Putin may not want to make a deal. Despite the uncertainty from Moscow, European leaders and President Zelensky have expressed their openness to direct negotiations in any format.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has publicly stated that the club has broken promises, leading to a loss of trust that makes his continued relationship with the team untenable. His statement aims to force an exit after the club rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool, with Isak claiming he had an understanding that he would be allowed to leave for the right price. Any potential transfer now appears to depend on Newcastle's ability to sign suitable replacements before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has affirmed its AA+ long-term credit rating for the United States, stating that it expects revenue from President Trump's tariff policies to largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. However, the rating agency issued a warning that a downgrade could occur within the next few years if budget deficits continue to rise. It also cautioned that political developments that undermine U.S. institutions or the independence of the Federal Reserve could also pressure the rating. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The senior housing market is experiencing a significant supply-demand imbalance as the baby boomer generation ages, driving up demand for facilities while new construction slows to its lowest level since 2009. This gap is creating a strong investment opportunity, with real estate investment trusts like Ventas acquiring billions of dollars in properties. High interest rates are a primary barrier to new development, but the sector is seeing robust rent growth and rising occupancy rates. (not investment advice)</p>
