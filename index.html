          <p>The Israel Defense Forces stated that over 250,000 Gaza City residents have moved southward to a designated "humanitarian zone" amid escalating military operations targeting Hamas. The IDF has intensified its attacks in Gaza City, focusing on buildings allegedly used by Hamas militants, while urging civilians to evacuate for their safety. Hamas, however, has called on residents to stay put, leading to a complex and dangerous situation for those caught in the conflict. Meanwhile, medics report numerous fatalities as the offensive continues in the city, and international concerns rise over the humanitarian impact. The conflict began after Hamas launched a major attack on Israel in October 2023. </p>
