        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Shares initially jumped nearly 17% before settling to a 7% increase, continuing a week-long trend that has seen the stock rise by over 58%. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to their potential to streamline payments and attract interest from major companies like Amazon and Walmart. The GENIUS Act aims to enhance consumer protections and promote the use of blockchains for global dollar transactions, potentially fostering wider adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The bill's passage signals increasing regulatory clarity, which is driving investor confidence in the stablecoin market. Optimism in the market is growing as regulatory frameworks become more clear. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, citing a lack of significant inflationary pressure from tariffs. In an interview, Waller emphasized the importance of proactively addressing potential labor market slowdowns by easing monetary policy. While the FOMC recently voted to hold interest rates steady, Waller's perspective suggests a willingness to act sooner rather than later to support economic stability. His stance contrasts with other officials who prefer to wait for more conclusive data on the impact of tariffs. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures as investors reacted positively to the prospect of lower borrowing costs. The market may be volatile in the coming months.

          <p>Taichi Kokubun, a member of the Japanese pop group Tokio, has been removed from the TV program "The Tetsuwan Dash" following allegations of past misconduct. The decision was made after a third-party investigation found that Kokubun had breached compliance rules on multiple occasions, reportedly involving behavior that could be considered sexual harassment. While details of the misconduct remain undisclosed to protect privacy, the TV network's president confirmed it was not a criminal matter. Kokubun has since issued an apology and announced an indefinite suspension of his activities. This incident occurs amidst increased scrutiny of Japan's entertainment industry, following other sexual misconduct scandals. The industry is trying to ensure greater compliance in light of recent events.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for thunderstorms across parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The UKHSA has issued an amber heat-health alert for England, warning of significant pressures on health and social care services. Some areas are at risk of tropical nights where temperatures do not drop below 20C. The hot weather has also led to a surge in wildfires, with firefighters responding to more than 500 across England and Wales this year. Authorities are urging the public to take precautions to prevent fires and protect vulnerable individuals during the heatwave. Climate change is contributing to more frequent and intense heatwaves.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics reveals that stricter state gun control measures are associated with a relative decrease in firearm deaths among children aged up to 17. The research divided states into categories based on the strength of their gun control laws and analyzed pediatric firearm death rates over a 12-year period. States with more permissive gun laws saw a notable increase in children's deaths from gun violence, while states with stricter laws experienced stagnant or declining rates. Experts emphasize the need for lawmakers to prioritize measures such as universal background checks and safe-storage regulations to protect children. The study suggests that policy choices can significantly impact the safety of children with regard to firearms.</p>

          <p>A debate has been ongoing regarding whether a return to office by President Trump would drive Europe and China closer together, however that prospect seems to have diminished. While EU leaders initially signaled openness to deeper trade ties with Beijing, recent impatience with China's lack of substantial progress on trade issues has surfaced. Brussels has grown frustrated with Beijing's reluctance to address trade grievances. This shift suggests that the EU is unlikely to align more closely with China, even in the face of potential trade challenges with the United States. Trade relations between the EU and China remain strained.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Invasive insects, such as the Asian tiger mosquito and the Asian hornet, are increasingly prevalent across Europe due to milder winters and global trade, causing significant harm to human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. These species compete with native insects, spread diseases, and damage crops, costing the EU billions annually. The Asian hornet, for example, preys on crucial pollinators like honeybees, while the brown marmorated stink bug damages fruit and vegetable crops. Efforts to manage these pests include trapping, nest removal, and biological controls, but experts emphasize that complete eradication is nearly impossible. Climate change is exacerbating the problem, making it crucial to implement stronger controls and develop sustainable alternatives. Invasive species are a major threat to native plants and animals in Europe.</p>

          <p>Singer Chris Brown pleaded not guilty in London to a charge of grievous bodily harm with intent, stemming from an alleged incident at a London nightclub in 2023. Brown was arrested in Manchester last month but was released after paying a security fee and has continued his tour. He has a history of legal issues, including a felony assault conviction against Rihanna in 2009. The case is ongoing, and Brown is scheduled to appear in court at a later date.

          <p>The BBC has decided not to broadcast a documentary about doctors working in Gaza due to impartiality concerns. The documentary, titled "Gaza: Doctors Under Attack," was produced by an independent production company and commissioned by the BBC. The BBC said it was "determined to report all aspects of the conflict in the Middle East impartially and fairly" and is transferring ownership of the film material to the production company. This decision follows public comments by the film's directors that criticized the BBC's coverage of the war in Gaza. The BBC maintains it will continue to cover events in Gaza impartially. The corporation is trying to maintain its journalistic integrity.</p>

          <p>Authorities in southern Mexico are assessing the damage caused by Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm. The storm resulted in at least two deaths and caused landslides, blocked highways, and downed power lines. Coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco, took the storm seriously due to memories of the devastating Hurricane Otis in 2023. Restaurants, shops, and supermarkets are gradually reopening, but schools remain closed as authorities continue to monitor rising rivers. Despite the rain, residents are beginning to venture out and assess the damage. The community is recovering from the storm.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is poised to enact profound social change as it moves closer to legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales. The Commons has backed a change in the law, and it is now likely, even highly likely, that the House of Lords will pass it too. This follows a recent vote by MPs to change abortion legislation, indicating a socially liberal shift in the country. This potential change is compared to other significant social reforms, such as the decriminalization of homosexuality and the introduction of gay marriage. Social change is coming to the UK.</p>

          <p>Republicans' proposed One Big Beautiful Bill Act could significantly impact low-income children and families by scaling back resources for key social safety net programs, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill aims to pay for an extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts by changing or reducing programs that provide healthcare, food benefits, and financial assistance. Proposed changes include allowing states to impose waiting periods for CHIP enrollment, adding work requirements to Medicaid, and expanding work requirements for SNAP. These changes could decrease resources for the poorest households by about $1,600 per year, while the wealthiest households could see an average annual gain of $12,000. There is disagreement on the benefits of this bill.</p>

          <p>A security review has been initiated across UK military bases after pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and vandalized military planes with red paint. Prime Minister Starmer condemned the action as "disgraceful," while the Ministry of Defence is working with police to investigate the incident. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, stating that the activists evaded security and put the air-to-air refueling tankers "out of service," although the RAF expects minimal operational impact. The group has engaged in similar activities targeting arms companies since the start of the war in Gaza. Security is being reviewed at UK military bases.</p>
