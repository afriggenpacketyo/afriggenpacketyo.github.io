          <p>Ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held discussions with senior Ukrainian officials in New York. The meeting focused on providing a status update on the war with Russia and reaffirming the goal of bringing both nations to the negotiating table to end the conflict. Witkoff's diplomatic approach has been praised by various U.S. and foreign officials as a constructive step toward brokering a peace agreement, despite criticism from some quarters regarding his experience. This diplomatic push continues even as Ukraine faces renewed large-scale attacks from Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. Typically, this security detail is provided for only six months after a vice president leaves office, but Harris had received an extension which has now been canceled. The decision comes as Harris is preparing for a national tour to promote her new book, which recounts her brief presidential campaign. A spokesperson for Harris acknowledged the change and expressed gratitude to the Secret Service for their service.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from the 2025 US Open after a decisive loss to Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina in the third round. Rybakina, the ninth seed, dominated the match with a powerful performance, winning 6-1, 6-2 in just 62 minutes. Raducanu, the 2021 champion, struggled with her serve and was unable to counter Rybakina's aggressive returns and baseline winners. The defeat marks an end to her run in New York, which had been seen as a sign of recent progress in her career.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the initial phase of a major offensive into Gaza City, declaring it a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending humanitarian pauses in the area. This escalation of the war against Hamas comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the recovery of the bodies of two hostages taken during the October 7th attack. The planned expansion has drawn international criticism and sparked domestic protests from citizens, including hostage families, who fear for the safety of those still held captive. The conflict continues to cause a severe humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court hearing concluded without a decision on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. Cook's legal team is challenging the administration's claim that it has legal cause for her removal, which is based on allegations of mortgage fraud leveled by a Trump appointee. The Department of Justice argued that determining "cause" is at the president's discretion, a position that raises significant questions about the Federal Reserve's independence.

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's injunction, arguing that the administration likely overstepped its authority in trying to terminate the protections. The ruling provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled their country's severe political and economic crisis. The Department of Homeland Security, under the Trump administration, had argued that conditions in Venezuela had improved enough to end the temporary program.</p>

The article highlights a shift toward "reverse translational research," where scientists study patients' real-world experiences to identify objective biomarkers for pain. This approach has led to groundbreaking trials using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to predict and intercept pain signals before they are fully experienced. While not yet widely available, these advancements demonstrate that pain circuitry is measurable and treatable, offering new hope for millions.</p>

The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggested the levy could raise up to £8 billion annually to offset taxpayer losses from the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that the program's design has resulted in a "government subsidy to commercial banks."

The piece suggests that the current crisis should prompt a broader conversation about reforming central banking to be more transparent and aligned with public priorities.

Newsom's strategy involves using small, targeted CHP teams to supplement local police in high-crime areas, a tactic that has been in use for years to address specific issues like auto theft. In contrast, Trump's deployment of troops is framed as a more authoritarian intervention to impose order.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her seventh album, "Man's Best Friend," and discussed her creative process and the public debate surrounding its initial cover art. In an interview, Carpenter explained that the album was written during a difficult personal period and that her songwriting is a way to process her experiences, including her sexuality. The original album cover, which depicted her in a kneeling position, was intended to be open to interpretation about control and the lack of it. Carpenter stated that while some critics misunderstood the image, her fans and family understood its intended meaning and context within the album's themes.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she does not plan to seek a third term in 2026. According to sources, Ernst, who has served in the Senate since 2015, intends to announce her decision next week and plans to move to the private sector. The 55-year-old senator had previously stated her intention to serve only two terms. Her departure will open up a key seat, adding to the list of retiring Senate Republicans and setting the stage for a competitive race, with several Iowa Democrats having already launched their campaigns.</p>

Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, but they face increasing competition from both licensed rivals and illegal offshore betting sites. In response to the growth of unlicensed gambling, which costs states an estimated $4 billion in tax revenue, law enforcement is stepping up its crackdown. Recently, Los Angeles filed a lawsuit against an online casino operator, and attorneys general have urged federal action. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This op-ed argues that the long-term shift in the U.S. education system from liberal arts to STEM and vocational training has left citizens ill-equipped for the demands of self-government. The author contends that the Trump administration's campaign for a "pro-American" history curriculum exploits this vulnerability, as a populace without historical literacy and critical thinking skills is more susceptible to propaganda. The piece asserts that public education's primary goal should be to create capable citizens, and the decline of the humanities has diminished empathy and the ability to evaluate complex arguments. It calls for a restoration of the liberal arts to the center of American education to safeguard democracy.</p>

Following the deadly school shooting in Minneapolis, he expressed openness to bipartisan solutions focused on mental health but reiterated that the problem is not guns but the "human heart," indicating no new gun control legislation is imminent.</p>

          <p>A long-standing U.S. tariff exemption for small-value packages, known as "de minimis," has been ended by the Trump administration, a move expected to increase costs for consumers and create logistical challenges. The rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country tariff-free, benefiting direct-to-consumer e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu as well as small overseas businesses. The change means these companies must now incorporate tariffs into their pricing, which could lead to noticeable price hikes and shipping delays. The White House justified the move by citing the need to protect American manufacturers and prevent the smuggling of illegal goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has informed Congress that he will not spend $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid, using a rare procedural tool known as a "pocket rescission." This maneuver involves proposing to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that Congress does not have the mandatory 45-day window to act, causing the funds to expire. The move, which targets the State Department and USAID, effectively allows the president to cut spending without legislative approval, raising concerns about bypassing Congress's power of the purse. This action is consistent with the administration's broader policy of making deep reductions to foreign aid.</p>
