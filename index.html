        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra pending an investigation into alleged ethical breaches. The case stems from a leaked phone call where she appeared to criticize a top army commander regarding a border dispute with Cambodia, a sensitive issue in a nation with a powerful military. This decision plunges her government into uncertainty, as it now holds a very slim majority after a key party left her coalition following the leak. An acting prime minister has been appointed while the court reviews the case.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, announced that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now considered "done." This declaration follows the eurozone's inflation rate falling to 1.9%, just below the bank's 2% target, and a reduction of the key interest rate from 4% to 2% over the past year. While the primary mission of taming the 2021-2022 price shocks is over, the ECB remains prepared to adapt to new economic developments and will continue monitoring data closely.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly fall since February 2023, dropping by 0.8% in June. This decline is largely attributed to weakened buyer demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which increased costs for many homebuyers. Despite the monthly dip, the annual price growth remains positive at 2.1%, and economists anticipate a market recovery driven by low unemployment and the possibility of future interest rate cuts.

          <p>The U.S. Senate held a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's massive tax and spending package, the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Republicans are utilizing the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority, to push the legislation forward ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. Democrats have used the procedure to force votes on the bill's most controversial elements, including cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, in an effort to highlight political divisions.</p>

          <p>A new law in Iowa has made it the first state in the U.S. to officially remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating legal protections against discrimination for transgender and nonbinary individuals. The law also strictly defines female and male based on reproductive organs at birth and prohibits changes to the sex designation on birth certificates. This move, which has been met with strong protests, is part of a wider trend in Republican-led states to enact laws restricting transgender rights.</p>

The author connects this to a broader political movement against Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) principles, especially in the United States. The piece concludes that this trend exposes the unreliability of capitalism as a driver for progressive change, as corporations quickly abandon such values when they become politically inconvenient.</p>
