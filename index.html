            <p>Former border czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's policy of sending "designated terrorists" to El Salvador's Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT), citing his decades of experience with border security and the "travesties" he has witnessed. Homan argued that protecting American citizens justifies sending even those without criminal records to such prisons. His comments came amid controversy and accusations from Democrats who claim the policy violates due process. The remarks were in response to the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose deportation is under scrutiny. Optimism score: 45</p>

            <p>Former White House Border Czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting he is a "public safety threat" and MS-13 member. Homan claims the administration does not have the ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., stating he is under El Salvador's authority. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia and accused him of neglecting victims of MS-13. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his gang affiliation, and the Supreme Court has ordered the administration to facilitate his return. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>British fighter jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace in separate incidents earlier this week, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence. RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea and another aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. The intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing mission, Operation Chessman, working alongside Sweden. The mission demonstrates the UK's commitment to NATO and its ability to defend the Alliance's airspace. Optimism score: 70</p>

            <p>A new study suggests that the Step Pyramid of Djoser, the oldest of Egypt's monumental pyramids, was built using a hydraulic lift system. This would significantly predate previous understandings of hydraulic engineering. The landscape, waterways, and pyramid's internal architecture support this theory, indicating that the ancient Egyptians had a sophisticated understanding of hydraulics. The team believes a system of dams and canals provided the necessary water to power the construction. Optimism score: 75</p>
