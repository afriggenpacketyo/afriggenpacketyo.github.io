          <p>Target's shares fell approximately 8% despite the company exceeding Wall Street's earnings and sales forecasts for the second quarter. The retailer announced that current COO Michael Fiddelke will become the new CEO in February, succeeding Brian Cornell. Fiddelke outlined priorities to recapture Target's unique brand identity, improve customer experience, and leverage technology, as the company has faced stagnant sales and declining store traffic for several years. The announcement comes as Target also ends its partnership with Ulta Beauty, though its digital sales showed a positive increase of 4.3% during the period.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova announced a $41 million investment to expand its generator manufacturing operations in Schenectady, New York, aiming to increase its gas power capacity. This move is a response to the unprecedented demand for its heavy-duty gas turbines, largely driven by the energy needs of new AI data centers. The company's gas turbines are reportedly sold out for 2026 and 2027, creating a significant order backlog. While this investment focuses on generators, which are crucial components that work with turbines, it is seen as a key step to prevent further supply chain bottlenecks and support the overall gas power business.

          <p>Chris Brain, a 68-year-old former priest, has been found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women at Inner London Crown Court. The charges stem from his leadership of the Nine O'Clock Service (NOS), an influential evangelical movement in Sheffield during the 1980s and 90s. Prosecutors detailed how Brain sexually abused women who were part of a "homebase team" tasked with caring for him, often during massages. The jury acquitted him of 15 other charges and is still deliberating on five remaining counts, including one of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has publicly addressed a social media post made by her mother, which criticized Connecticut Sun player Bria Hartley following Cunningham's season-ending knee injury. Cunningham clarified that the injury, an MCL tear sustained when Hartley fell into her leg, was an unintentional basketball play and that she holds no ill will towards Hartley, whom she considers a friend. She revealed on her podcast that she asked her mother to delete the post, which called Hartley a "disgruntled player."

          <p>Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency appointed by President Trump, has publicly stated that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook should resign or be fired over allegations of mortgage fraud. Pulte's comments followed his letter to the Department of Justice requesting a criminal investigation into Cook, claiming she falsified documents to secure more favorable loan terms on properties in Michigan and Georgia. President Trump amplified the call for her resignation on social media. This move represents an escalation of the Trump administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve and its officials.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, is moving up the Atlantic and threatening the North Carolina coast with strong winds and significant coastal flooding. Although not expected to make a direct landfall in the U.S., mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for parts of the Outer Banks, including Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands. Officials are warning residents along the entire East Coast of "life-threatening surf and rip currents" for several days, urging them to stay out of the ocean. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 strength, is the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has condemned a U.S. appeals court decision that temporarily blocked a land transfer required for the Resolution Copper mine project in Arizona. In a social media post, Trump labeled the opposition from groups including the San Carlos Apache Tribe as "Anti-American," arguing the delay jeopardizes jobs and a needed copper supply. The project, a joint venture between mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, has faced long-standing legal challenges over religious, cultural, and environmental concerns.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a state law that would have required all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. U.S. District Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law, set to take effect September 1, likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. The lawsuit was filed by several families and civil liberties groups, who argued the mandate constituted unconstitutional religious coercion of students.

The move is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown, which also includes allocating $46 million for new wall construction. This announcement comes as border crossings have dropped to record lows, which the administration attributes to its deterrent policies of sweeping arrests and detentions.</p>

The breakthrough involves a specially engineered yeast that produces all the essential nutrients bees need to survive, particularly lipids called sterols, which were previously difficult to manufacture. In trials, bee colonies that consumed the supplement had up to 15 times more offspring that grew to adulthood. This development could help beekeepers sustain their colonies when natural pollen is scarce, which is crucial for global crop pollination.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their GCSE and other Level 2 qualification results this Thursday. After several years of grade adjustments following the COVID-19 pandemic, the pass rate is expected to be similar to 2024 levels. However, education experts warn that students may face increased competition for places at popular sixth form colleges due to a larger population of 16-year-olds and growing demand. This cohort of students began secondary school under pandemic restrictions, adding a unique context to their educational journey as they await their crucial grades.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Florida and University College London reveals that daily reading for pleasure among American adults has declined by over 40% in the last two decades. Analyzing data from 2003 to 2023, researchers found a steady drop, with the percentage of adults who read for leisure on a typical day falling from 28% in 2004 to 16% in 2023. The decline is attributed to digital distractions, an overall decrease in leisure time, and uneven access to books. This trend is concerning to researchers, as reading for pleasure is linked to improved well-being and mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A High Court decision to block a hotel in Epping, UK, from housing asylum seekers has created potential challenges for the government's accommodation strategy. The ruling was based on the local council's argument that the hotel's change of use breached planning controls and negatively impacted the community, citing factors like protests and fear of crime. While the decision does not end the nationwide use of hotels for asylum seekers, it may empower other councils to pursue similar legal action if they can demonstrate tangible harm. This could complicate the government's efforts to manage the asylum seeker backlog and reduce reliance on costly hotel accommodations.</p>

          <p>Even as mortgage rates have fallen to a 10-month low, many potential home buyers, particularly first-timers, remain on the sidelines due to record-high home prices and a persistent lack of inventory.

Many prospective buyers are waiting for both prices and interest rates to fall further before entering the market.
