        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US court ruling challenged President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, a key economic tool he has used extensively. The court gave the White House 10 days to remove almost all tariffs, but a federal appeals court has stayed the trade court's ruling, which means that those tariffs will stay in place for now. The administration argued that the ruling would cripple the president's ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. Economists and analysts have expressed concerns about the instability caused by Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, with some coining the term "Taco trade" to describe his tendency to back down from imposing steep import taxes.

Faizan, who was a favorite and last year's runner-up, triumphed after a dramatic final round where the last three contestants misspelled their words.

The spelling bee marked its 100th anniversary this year, although the winner was the 110th champion due to past ties.</p>

During the execution of search warrants, 288 stolen bicycles and other stolen merchandise were recovered, and the five suspects were taken into custody, who are now under investigation for their involvement in the theft.</p>

          <p>A new Israeli-backed aid distribution system in Gaza is struggling to meet the overwhelming need, with the United Nations describing the amount of food being distributed as "less than a drop in the ocean." The situation highlights the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where access to essential resources remains severely limited. The challenges in providing adequate aid underscore the urgent need for more effective and comprehensive solutions to address the widespread food insecurity and hardship faced by the population. The effectiveness of the current aid efforts is questionable given the magnitude of the need.</p>

She stated that Britain cannot afford such policies and needs leaders who approach economics seriously. Her comments follow Farage's pledge to remove the cap and Labour's indication of potentially doing the same, sparking debate over the financial implications and the role of the welfare state.</p>

Trump praised Musk and stated he will "always be with us, helping all the way." Musk's tenure at DOGE, which began in January, is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. Despite criticism from Democrats, DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, and markets have reacted positively to Musk's return to the private sector.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's 129-day tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) concluded with significant impacts on the federal government, marked by spending cuts and controversies. Musk aimed to cut at least $2 trillion, later shifting to $1tn and ultimately $175bn, through asset sales, lease cancellations, and workforce reductions. His presence raised ethical concerns due to potential conflicts of interest with his companies, such as SpaceX and Tesla, which have government contracts. Additionally, Musk's role led to cuts in USAID programs, sparking debates about US isolationism and the spread of misinformation within the government.</p>

Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to reinforce tracks affected by landslides and coastal erosion. The rail line, used by Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, was closed in April for emergency construction approved by the California Coastal Commission. Crews have placed 5,900 tons of large boulders and will add up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail. The total cost of the projects is estimated at $300 million.</p>

          <p>A 43-year-old mother with stage 4 colorectal cancer is experiencing life-threatening delays in her treatment due to cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented by the Trump administration. Natalie Phelps, who is part of a cell-based immunotherapy trial, was informed that her treatment would be delayed by several weeks due to staff reductions. This delay has caused significant anxiety as her cancer has progressed, raising concerns about her eligibility for the trial.

The administration is pushing ICE to carry out a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, which would significantly expand immigration enforcement.
