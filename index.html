          <p>The House of Representatives is debating a massive policy and tax bill backed by President Trump, following its narrow passage in the Senate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate's version would add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over ten years, creating concern among some Republican fiscal conservatives. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a slim majority and potential attendance issues, making the vote uncertain. Meanwhile, President Trump announced a revised trade agreement with Vietnam, lowering tariffs in exchange for market access for U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>The High Court in the UK has ordered a new, "robust and independent" investigation into MI5 after it was revealed the security service provided false evidence to multiple courts. The case originated from a BBC investigation into a neo-Nazi informant. The judges rejected two previous internal inquiries as "seriously deficient" and commended the BBC for exposing the issue. The new investigation will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, as the court seeks to restore trust in the justice system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the president to fire three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). This follows a lower court's ruling that blocked the removal of the commissioners, who were appointed by the previous administration for fixed seven-year terms. Federal law protects such commissioners from at-will removal to ensure agency independence from political influence. The administration argues the president should have unrestricted power to remove executive officers, escalating a broader test of presidential authority over independent agencies.</p>

Defense lawyers successfully argued that Combs' staff were not knowingly complicit in the alleged "freak-offs," undermining the enterprise element of the charge. Each of the two guilty counts carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, with sentencing to be determined later.</p>

          <p>Iran has ordered the suspension of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), limiting access for inspectors to its nuclear facilities. The move, signed into law by President Masoud Pezeshkian, is conditioned on guarantees for the "security" of its nuclear sites, following recent US and Israeli airstrikes. This action could impede the international community's ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program, which has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. The decision drew immediate condemnation from Israel, which urged European nations to reinstate UN sanctions against Tehran.</p>

          <p>Fabricated news segments created with artificial intelligence are increasingly appearing on social media platforms like TikTok, mimicking the style of legitimate journalism to spread misinformation. These "synthetic newscasts" are easy and cheap to produce using new AI video-generation tools, making it difficult for users to distinguish real news from fake. Digital forensics experts warn that these videos, which often tackle polarizing topics, are designed to provoke outrage and can erode public trust. Viewers are advised to look for subtle clues like unnatural speech and to rely on trusted news sources.</p>

While the original protests had clear political leaders, the current movement is seen as a more grassroots, leaderless effort.
