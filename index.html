          <p>Friedrich Merz has named Johann Wadephul, a close ally and experienced CDU lawmaker, as Germany's new Foreign Minister, succeeding Annalena Bock. Wadephul, known for his pro-European stance and support for Ukraine, has been advising Merz on foreign policy and has already engaged with foreign ministers in Paris, London, and Warsaw. His appointment signals a shift in Germany's diplomatic priorities and a continued commitment to European integration and support for Ukraine against Russian aggression.

CENTCOM states that these strikes have degraded the pace and effectiveness of Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, decreasing ballistic missile launches and drone attacks, though the Houthis continue to launch attacks, backed by Iranian support. The Houthis began targeting shipping in late 2023, disrupting trade through the Suez Canal, in what they claim is solidarity with Palestinians. Optimism score: 20</p>

          <p>Timothy Garton Ash argues that liberals worldwide must unite against the growing strength of anti-liberal powers, particularly in the face of assaults on liberal values from the United States. He emphasizes the need to disperse and control power to ensure freedom, advocating for a coalition of states, civil society actors, and active citizens to counter the rise of anti-liberal nationalism. He identifies the need to address the problems created by liberalism itself, including inequality and cultural neglect, to strengthen the fight for equal individual liberty. Optimism score: 60</p>
