          <p>Green Tea Group experienced a weak start in its Hong Kong stock market debut, with shares initially unchanged before declining by 7%. The company raised HK$847 million (US$108.5 million) through its IPO, but traders are more focused on the upcoming debut of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery pack maker. CATL's US$5.3 billion IPO is highly anticipated, overshadowing smaller stock sales like Green Tea Group's. Fifteen companies raised HK$17.7 billion in Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, positioning the city as a prominent IPO destination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting and then deleting an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to spell "8647," which Republicans interpreted as a threat to President Donald Trump.

Comey initially captioned the photo "Cool shell formation on my beach walk," but later removed the post after allegations of incitement to violence. Comey stated he opposes violence of any kind, and did not realize the numbers were associated with violence.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million patients by 2050. In 1990, China had approximately 4 million dementia patients, which increased to 17 million by 2021. Researchers from Fudan University analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease database and found that the incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of dementia cases have doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but tripled in China. The study did not specify a singular reason for the increase, but noted that China's rapidly aging population is a contributing factor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is facing challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Since 2007, over 900 humpback whales have been injured or killed by these ropes. Some fishermen are using experimental pop-up technology, developed by the U.S. military, which uses remote-controlled devices to bring crab cages to the surface, reducing rope usage and whale entanglements. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to mitigate the risk to whales, though fishermen using the pop-up gear can continue fishing.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, approximately 50,000 years ago. This migration occurred when lower sea levels created a land bridge connecting the two continents, allowing for genetic exchanges between horse populations. Among the fossils studied were Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The findings were published in the journal Science, highlighting the dynamic movement of species across continents in prehistoric times.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices have expressed reservations regarding Donald Trump's attempt to circumvent the Constitution by restricting birthright citizenship. The cases before the court stem from Trump's executive order denying U.S. citizenship to babies born on American soil if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The plan contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States. The court is also considering the Justice Department's argument against nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges, which they claim unfairly limit the president's authority.</p>

          <p>An audit in Maryland revealed that medical examiners miscategorized dozens of deaths occurring in police custody over the past two decades. The report found that at least 36 of these deaths should have been classified as homicides but were instead labeled as accidental or due to natural causes. The audit, prompted by the police killing of George Floyd, indicated evidence of racism and pro-police bias. Maryland's attorney general stated these findings have profound implications for the justice system, reflecting systemic issues rather than individual misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, leaving Treasury officials scrambling to understand the scope and pace of the rollback. Syria's transitional government has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges and rebuild the war-torn country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The gross domestic product data was worse than economists' expectations, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from President Donald Trump's trade policies have impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had recently cautioned that the country's economy is likely to moderate, citing the effects of global trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, faced a 145% tariff hike, followed by a reduction to 30% after a U.S.-China truce. The situation forces businesses to either pay higher shipping costs or delay orders, hoping for further tariff reductions.

The civil trial was the first time a court assessed war crimes claims by Australian forces. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence but has not been charged in a criminal court.
