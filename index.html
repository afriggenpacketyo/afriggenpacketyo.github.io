          <p>Baltimore's gun violence has decreased significantly, partly due to the Safe Streets program.  This initiative employs individuals with criminal records as "trusted messengers" to mediate conflicts and provide resources in high-crime areas. The program's success is evident in Brooklyn's record-breaking streak without homicides, and similar programs across the US have shown positive results. This innovative approach highlights the potential of community-based solutions to address crime.</p>
