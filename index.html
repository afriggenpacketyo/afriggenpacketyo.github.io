          <p>This article details the timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to El Salvador in March 2025, despite a 2019 court order protecting him from deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration alleged gang ties to MS-13, which his family denies. After legal battles, including Supreme Court involvement, Garcia was eventually indicted for human trafficking and brought back to the U.S. to face charges. The case raised questions about due process and the government's handling of immigration matters.</p>

The race distance is shortened to 1 1/4 miles due to the temporary venue change.

          <p>Jonathan Turley discusses Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, not for a removal hearing, but to face human trafficking charges that could lead to imprisonment and subsequent deportation. Turley argues that the Trump administration's initial failure to simply bring Garcia back for a removal hearing led to further scrutiny of his background. Allegations of gang involvement and domestic abuse surfaced, complicating his case and leading to the indictment. The article suggests that Garcia's notoriety may have contributed to his legal troubles.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of imposing time limits on federal rental assistance, examining a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. The Delaware program offers incentives like interest-bearing savings accounts to help people transition off subsidies. While some argue that time limits encourage self-sufficiency and turnover, others worry about the potential for increased homelessness, citing a failed experiment in Washington state. The article suggests that additional support, such as savings programs and assistance with budgeting, is crucial for the success of time-limited rental aid.</p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the liquor industry as their preferences shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town known for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to meet the demand for low-alcohol wines. Liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger consumers, focusing on self-indulgent experiences rather than social rituals. This shift marks a significant change in China's alcohol market, where baijiu has long been the dominant choice.</p>

The increased surveillance also affects entire neighborhoods, with businesses reporting a decline in customers and community members expressing fear of deportation.

          <p>A recent report reveals that fees on forgotten 401(k) accounts can cost workers thousands of dollars in lost retirement savings. Former employees who leave their 401(k)s with their previous employers may be charged additional maintenance fees that erode their principal and reduce potential compound growth. While rolling over funds into an IRA may seem like a solution, IRAs often have higher investment fees. The Department of Labor has created a retirement savings lost and found database to help workers locate old retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the controversy surrounding President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on the Army's birthday. While some critics view the parade as an authoritarian display of power, the author argues that it could be a patriotic celebration and an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the military. The parade could also help address the military's shrinking recruitment numbers by bringing Americans closer to service members. The author acknowledges the risk that Trump may use the event for political purposes but suggests the military should focus on honoring the troops.</p>
