          <p>The Trump administration announced new tariffs, including a 100% duty on branded pharmaceutical products, set to begin on October 1. This move, aimed at encouraging domestic manufacturing, caused an immediate negative reaction in Asian markets, with major pharmaceutical stock indices in Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong experiencing significant declines. The announcement also included new levies on heavy trucks and furniture, adding to broader trade tensions. The article notes these developments occurred as the administration also approved a new deal structure for TikTok's U.S. operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported heavy trucks, effective October 1, as part of a broader strategy to shield U.S. manufacturers from what he termed "unfair outside competition." The move is intended to protect major American truck companies like Peterbilt, Kenworth, and Freightliner. This specific tariff was part of a larger set of duties announced simultaneously, which also targeted pharmaceuticals, kitchen cabinets, and furniture. The administration justified the tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which permits such actions on national security grounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, President Trump stated that Comey had "placed a cloud over the entire nation" with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. In an exclusive interview, Trump called the probe a "hoax" that was "terrible and so corrupt," asserting that it could have led to wars. He characterized Comey as a "terrible man" and suggested the scandal was worse than Watergate. The indictment charges Comey with making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning about a dramatic increase in infections from a "superbug" known as NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE). Between 2019 and 2023, infections from this bacteria, which is resistant to powerful antibiotics, surged by more than 460%. While the exact cause is undetermined, experts note an association with antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health officials are concerned because the bacteria is difficult to treat, can spread easily in healthcare settings, and poses a significant threat of increased infections and deaths.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Comey Indictment Serves as a Test for Future Political Prosecutions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 21:35:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is more than just personal retribution by President Trump; it represents a strategic move to test the politicization of the justice system. The author suggests the administration plans to target political opponents and their financial backers, citing recent executive orders aimed at investigating liberal donors. The piece frames the prosecution as a forward-looking effort to undermine the rule of law ahead of the 2026 elections, thereby protecting the president from future accountability. It warns that the case puts not only Comey's rights at risk, but also the integrity of the democratic process itself.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The charges relate to testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020 concerning his knowledge of an information leak to the media. In response, Comey posted a video stating he is "not afraid" and that the charges are a cost of "standing up to Donald Trump." The indictment has drawn sharp political reactions, with Attorney General Pam Bondi stating "no one is above the law," while critics like Senator Mark Warner condemned it as a "dangerous abuse of power."</p>

The execution proceeded despite pleas for clemency from the victim's son, Will Berry, who had forgiven West and urged the governor to commute the sentence to life in prison. In a final statement, West acknowledged this forgiveness and expressed that he was at peace. The execution method, which involves inducing hypoxia by breathing pure nitrogen, has been used seven times in the U.S. The victim's son expressed astonishment that the execution was carried out and offered condolences to West's family.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to a $1.5 billion settlement between the AI company Anthropic and a group of authors and publishers. The lawsuit alleged that Anthropic illegally used nearly half a million pirated books to train its Claude chatbot models. Under the agreement, authors and publishers will receive approximately $3,000 for each book involved, although it does not cover future works. The Authors Guild hailed the settlement as a milestone that sends a clear message to AI companies about the high cost of copyright infringement. The case resolves claims about how the training materials were obtained, while a previous ruling on AI training as "fair use" remains intact.</p>

          <p>A California bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the programs they interrupt. The legislation was inspired by the experience of a legislative aide whose sleeping baby was repeatedly awakened by blaring ads. While a 2010 federal law, the CALM Act, already governs commercial volume for broadcast and cable TV, it does not apply to streaming platforms. Because of California's market size, the bill could effectively set a new national standard if signed into law by the governor, as companies are unlikely to create separate policies for the state.</p>

An autopsy revealed the child suffered numerous broken bones, bite marks, and multiple fatal injuries. Milam's final appeals, which argued his conviction was based on discredited bite mark evidence and that he was intellectually disabled, were rejected by the Supreme Court.

This will likely encourage Chinese companies already active in this space to increase their research and development spending. Metsera is focused on developing drugs that offer better efficacy and tolerability with less frequent injections than current market leaders. The acquisition is seen as part of a broader portfolio-strengthening strategy by major players like Pfizer, Roche, and Eli Lilly. (not investment advice)</p>

One part is booming, driven by massive investments in artificial intelligence from cash-rich tech giants who are largely indifferent to interest rates. The other part, consisting of foundational consumer-oriented sectors like housing, autos, and retail, is struggling and requires interest rate cuts to avoid further decline. Cramer argues that while overall GDP growth appears strong, this strength is heavily concentrated in the tech sector, masking the weakness affecting the daily lives of most of the workforce. Recent disappointing earnings from companies like CarMax and KB Home, alongside layoffs at Starbucks, underscore this troubling divide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Urban Rat Populations Are Surging Globally, Driven by Climate Change and Waste</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities around the world, from New York to London, are experiencing a significant increase in their rat populations, a phenomenon some are calling "Ratmageddon." Experts attribute the surge to several factors, including rising global temperatures, which allow rats to breed more successfully during warmer winters. A recent study found a strong correlation between temperature increases and spikes in rat activity in major cities. Additionally, increased food waste from a growing urban population and, in some cases, less frequent trash collection, provide an abundant food source that fuels the population boom. This poses a public health risk, as rats can transmit diseases like leptospirosis to humans.</p>

          <p>The owner of the Kumonoue Fuji Hotel in Japan has been detained after allegedly ordering workers to illegally cut down 23 of a neighbor's trees to secure an unobstructed view of Mount Fuji. The incident, which occurred several years ago, escalated after the neighbor, identified as Inoue, refused to remove the trees. Hotel workers allegedly trespassed onto the property, felled the trees, and spread herbicide. Initially, hotel management denied involvement and the owner fled the country, but was eventually apprehended in April 2025. The case highlights an extreme example of a neighbor dispute, with one hotel staffer reportedly boasting that "the Japanese police can't catch us."</p>

The bodies of Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5) were found in early June at a campground; an autopsy revealed they had been suffocated. Decker, who had a history of worsening mental health issues, failed to return the girls to their mother after a scheduled visit, triggering a massive three-month search. He was a former Army infantryman with survival training, and his remains were found in a remote wooded area, ending the extensive manhunt.</p>

          <p>Costco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a 14% increase in membership fee income and a 13.5% rise in e-commerce sales. The warehouse club has successfully attracted more members, particularly younger shoppers, as consumers continue to seek value. The company noted it has been working to offset the impact of tariffs by introducing private-label alternatives and shifting its merchandise assortment. Despite decelerating same-store sales growth, overall traffic to its stores and website increased globally. The results indicate Costco's business model remains robust in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans is facing a potential exodus of hundreds of volunteers over a controversial plan to close more than half of its 200+ branches across the UK and Ireland. The proposal aims to consolidate operations into larger offices and a remote, work-from-home model, which leadership claims will allow them to answer more calls and reduce wait times. However, many volunteers argue the closures will sever vital local community ties and that the support structure for remote volunteers is inadequate. Critics fear the loss of experienced volunteers could compromise the charity's ability to provide its life-saving services, with some branches calling for a no-confidence vote in the chairman.</p>

          <p>After being viewed as a prime takeover target earlier in the year, British energy giant BP has seen its position strengthen significantly, quieting acquisition rumors. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since April, outperforming rivals, due to a strategic reset, leadership changes, and recent successful oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized a focus on growth to drive shareholder value. Analysts note that improved quarterly results and the appointment of a new chairman with a history of successful turnarounds have boosted investor confidence, making a takeover less likely and marking a notable turnaround from its previous embattled state.

Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the legal action is necessary to ensure states are maintaining clean voter rolls in compliance with federal law and to safeguard elections against fraud. California's Secretary of State, Shirley Weber, condemned the lawsuit as a "blatant overreach" and a "fishing expedition" intended to intimidate state officials into releasing the private information of millions of voters.

In response, a new letter from a group of over 1,200 industry figures, including Liev Schreiber and Mayim Bialik, rejects the boycott as "discriminatory and antisemitic propaganda." This second letter, organized by the group Creative Community For Peace, accuses the first of spreading misinformation and shielding Hamas from accountability, urging artists to instead call for the release of hostages.</p>

To qualify, borrowers only need to attest that the fires caused a financial hardship.
