          <p>Japan remains at 118th place out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap rankings, the lowest among G7 nations, according to the World Economic Forum. While there has been improvement in women's economic participation, Japan ranks poorly in political empowerment due to the low number of female government ministers and the lack of a female prime minister. The report estimates it will take 123 years to achieve full gender parity globally. Japan's overall performance slightly improved from last year, but progress in narrowing the gender gap has been slow since 2006, scoring below the average trend of improvement for the countries analyzed.</p>

The charges range from assault upon a peace officer to commercial burglary and vandalism, with potential sentences varying based on the severity of the crimes.

          <p>The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has accused Hamas of attacking a bus carrying its aid workers, resulting in at least five fatalities. The group stated that the incident occurred on Wednesday evening and also reported multiple injuries, with concerns that some team members may have been taken hostage. Despite objections from the UN, the GHF has taken over aid distribution in the Gaza Strip, which is a region experiencing ongoing conflict and humanitarian crises.

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee emphasized the importance of winning the nuclear energy renaissance to avoid losing the AI war to China and the energy war to Russia.

Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, stating that it is standard for a new administration to reassess agreements.

          <p>The podcast "Agushto PapÃ¡" is calling on mÃºsica Mexicana artists to show greater visibility and support for immigrant communities amid ongoing ICE raids in Los Angeles. The podcast hosts expressed disappointment that many artists, who often highlight their culture and heritage, have remained silent about the sweeps. They urge artists to spread awareness or contribute resources to the community, especially given the support many provided during the January wildfires. Some artists, including Ivan Cornejo and Becky G, have voiced their support, but the podcast emphasizes the need for more widespread action.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has declined by 16 points since March, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, falling to 62% from 78%. This drop follows a public falling out between Musk and President Donald Trump, stemming from disagreements over the president's spending bill. Despite the decline, Musk remains popular among Republicans after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with 80% rating his work as either excellent or good. The poll also found that only 3% of Democrats surveyed hold a favorable view of Musk.</p>

Bessent's remarks suggest a willingness to push the deadline beyond the initial 90 days, though Trump has stated that he doesn't believe an extension will be necessary.

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review is being framed as a turning point, emphasizing long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. However, day-to-day spending is limited, and even cut in some areas, at a time when the electorate is restless and many feel economically squeezed. The government is taking a gamble on patience, hoping that long-term investments will yield results despite the current climate of impatience. This approach contrasts with the typical critique of political leaders focusing on short-term wins rather than strategic long-term planning.</p>

This discovery helps revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite the evolution of tyrannosaurs. The new species also shows early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' dominance, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.</p>
