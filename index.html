          <p>The chairwoman of Prince Harry's former charity, Sentebale, accuses him and his PR team of bullying tactics, including a request to publicly defend Meghan Markle after a media incident at a polo match.  The accusations involve alleged pressure to issue a statement supporting Markle, despite the chairwoman's belief that it would harm the charity's independence.  The narrative, presented by Fox News, may exhibit a pro-monarchy bias, potentially downplaying Harry's perspective.</p>
