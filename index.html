            <h2>LA County DA Seeks Delay in Menendez Brothers Resentencing Pending Parole Board Assessment Review</h2>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has requested a pause in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing, citing the need to review a recently completed parole board risk assessment. This motion follows a judge's denial of the DA's request to withdraw a previous motion favoring reduced sentences. The DA argues that the court should have access to the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions. Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 1989 killings of their parents, but former DA George Gascón filed a motion to reduce their sentences.</p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump amidst escalating trade tensions between the United States and the European Union.

The EU is closely watching Meloni's meeting, hoping she can facilitate negotiations to resolve trade disputes. Trump sees the EU's trade surplus with the U.S. as unfair and unbalanced, leading to the imposition of tariffs.</p>

Kettle emphasizes that freer trade with Europe remains more crucial for the UK's economic growth.

            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a top researcher on ultra-processed foods at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has resigned, alleging censorship by aides to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Hall claims he was blocked from speaking directly to a reporter about his research and that his written answers were edited without his consent. He also alleges that he was prevented from presenting his research at a conference and faced an ultimatum regarding a manuscript. The HHS denies these allegations, calling them "false claims."</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law is dominating newspaper front pages. Headlines range from "Victory for Women" to "Equality Policies in Chaos," reflecting the varied interpretations of the ruling's impact. The decision is expected to lead to changes in single-sex spaces, including NHS wards and elite sports, and has prompted calls for a review of the UK's gender recognition laws. The ruling is being hailed by some as a victory for common sense and women's rights, while others express concern about its implications for trans rights.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have reached a new record high as investors grow increasingly concerned about the impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China. The precious metal is considered a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. Comments from the head of the U.S. central bank, warning that President Donald Trump's tariff policies could lead to slower growth and higher prices, have further fueled the surge in gold prices. Analysts are comparing the current gold rally to the Iranian Revolution, when prices soared dramatically. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny over its deportation policies, particularly regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem has canceled $2.7 million in DHS grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about "anti-American, pro-Hamas ideology" on campus. The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30 or risk losing its certification to enroll international students. The move follows President Donald Trump's decision to freeze federal funding to Harvard and ask the IRS to revoke its tax-exempt status. The DHS action is part of a broader federal crackdown on campus antisemitism.</p>

The proposed law, which includes guaranteed hours and restrictions on zero-hour contracts, is argued to potentially harm growth and employment at a precarious time for the UK economy. Business groups are concerned the changes will discourage companies from hiring and introduce unnecessary administrative costs. The government maintains the Bill will deliver the "biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation."</p>
