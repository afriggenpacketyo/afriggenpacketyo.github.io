          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a match viewed as a significant test for their youth-driven project. Despite being underdogs against the formidable European champions, Chelsea's management remains committed to their long-term strategy, regardless of the final's outcome. The club sees the final as a chance to validate their progress and sustainable model, having already secured significant financial benefits from the tournament. The match also highlights tactical questions for manager Enzo Maresca, who is expected to maintain his attacking style against PSG's intense press.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34C. Amber heat health alerts are active for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia, while millions in Yorkshire, Kent, and Sussex are under hosepipe bans due to record-level demand for water. The extreme heat has also impacted events like the Wimbledon tennis championships, which implemented special rules for player safety. Forecasters expect the heatwave to subside by Monday as cooler Atlantic air moves in, bringing cloud and showers to northern and western regions.</p>

          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained during an immigration raid on a cannabis farm in California, where approximately 200 undocumented migrants were arrested. The Department of Homeland Security stated the individual was not being pursued when they fell from a greenhouse roof. The raids, part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, led to protests and clashes with federal agents. In response to the events, President Trump authorized law enforcement to use necessary means to arrest protesters who assault them, while a federal judge has temporarily restricted certain aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers player Kobe Brown sustained a right ankle contusion during a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets, forcing him to exit in the third quarter. Before the injury, Brown demonstrated significant potential as a rotational player, scoring 14 points in 20 minutes and impressing with his defense and offensive reads. The team described the decision to hold him out for the rest of the game as precautionary, expressing confidence that the injury is not serious. Teammate Jordan Miller also had a strong performance, contributing 23 points and 11 rebounds in the Clippers' 95-92 victory.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship via a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which concluded their historic trilogy, was a tactical and gripping contest, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. While not as explosive as their previous encounters, Taylor's smarter, more economical boxing style proved decisive against Serrano's changed approach. Following the victory, Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting she will take time before making a decision.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' losing streak reached seven games following an 8-7 defeat to the San Francisco Giants, their longest skid since 2017. Despite a late-game offensive surge that saw them score five runs and chase Giants ace Logan Webb, the Dodgers could not overcome an early deficit. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs in under five innings, which proved too much for the team to recover from. Although manager Dave Roberts and players noted the improved offensive fight as a positive, the result narrowed their division lead and continued a frustrating period for the team.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that Israel's proposed plan to move Palestinians in Rafah into a confined camp constitutes a crime against humanity, highlighting a broader failure of international law. The author, Raja Shehadeh, reflects on the historical and ongoing dispossession of Palestinians, arguing that the international legal system has consistently lacked the power to enforce protections or accountability. Instead of placing hope in legal institutions, the author points to the enduring Palestinian spirit of "sumoud," or steadfast resilience, as the ultimate force that will endure. The piece concludes that global accountability will come from recognizing shared humanity, not just legal frameworks.</p>

Hamas has accused the Israeli delegation of lacking the authority to make meaningful compromises and using the talks to buy time. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel showing proposed buffer zones that were far deeper than previously discussed, eroding trust between the two sides.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are analyzing the growing alignment between parts of the U.S. tech sector and the "Make America Great Again" political movement, suggesting it could intensify the tech rivalry with China. An article in a Chinese academic journal notes that as tech leaders deepen ties with the U.S. defense industry, they may adopt a more aggressive "tech hawk" stance against Beijing. Most of Donald Trump's tech supporters are reportedly pushing for continued pressure to contain China's technological development and further decoupling in high-tech sectors. However, the analysis also suggests that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA base could ultimately undermine this alliance.</p>

This discovery makes accidental activation seem unlikely, as the switches have multiple safety features.

This is expected to pave the way for numerous cheaper generic versions, significantly increasing affordability and access for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic drug companies will compete for market share, driving down prices in a market valued at over $150 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man in Stockton, California, has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly setting a San Joaquin County probation officer on fire. The incident occurred when the suspect entered the probation office with a gas can and a lighter, prompting a confrontation with officers. During a struggle in a nearby parking lot, the suspect reportedly ignited the fuel, causing significant but non-life-threatening burns to one officer's arms. The suspect, who was on supervision for a firearm felony, was also injured, taken into custody, and now faces charges of attempted murder, obstruction, and arson.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365-million expansion project for one of its major terminals, despite a recent slowdown in port activity due to global trade uncertainties and rising tariffs. The project, run by International Transportation Service, will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% and extend the quay to accommodate larger ships. Port officials acknowledged the current uncertainty in the shipping industry but expressed confidence in the long-term need for growth and investment. They framed the project as a crucial step to strengthen America's supply chain and ensure the port remains competitive in the future.</p>

          <p>As part of a broad effort by the Trump administration to reduce the federal workforce, the U.S. State Department has laid off more than 1,000 employees. The involuntary staff reductions included 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service personnel, according to an internal notice. These cuts follow the voluntary departure of over 1,500 other employees earlier in the year. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have argued that the mass cuts are indiscriminate and will undermine U.S. national security and the department's ability to function effectively, particularly impacting refugee resettlement programs.</p>

          <p>"The Night We Met," a song by the indie band Lord Huron, has become a massive global success a decade after its quiet release in 2015. Initially the final track on an album that barely charted, the song's popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its growth has continued to snowball through its widespread use on TikTok, and it has now accumulated over three billion plays on Spotify alone. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable, wistful theme of a soured relationship, which allows listeners to insert their own stories into it.</p>

          <p>The British soft toy company Jellycat has abruptly stopped supplying its products to around 100 independent gift shops across the UK, leaving many small business owners "gutted" and confused. The company, whose plush toys have surged in popularity due to social media trends, sent a form email stating the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was not open to negotiation. Many of the affected shop owners, who had stocked the brand for years and relied on it for significant income, feel they are being pushed aside in favor of larger retailers and more theatrical, immersive displays in department stores.</p>
