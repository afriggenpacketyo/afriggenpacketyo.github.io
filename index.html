          <h2>Analyst Predicts Reduced Smartphone Shipment Growth for Apple and Samsung Due to Tariff Concerns</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Counterpoint Research has significantly lowered its 2025 global smartphone shipment growth forecast, citing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies, particularly impacting Apple and Samsung. The research firm now projects a 1.9% year-on-year growth, down from the previous 4.2% expectation, with Apple's growth forecast reduced from 4% to 2.5% and Samsung's anticipated growth eliminated entirely. While tariffs play a role, weakened demand in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia also contribute to these revised forecasts, with Huawei emerging as a bright spot, expecting an 11% shipment growth due to easing component sourcing bottlenecks. The reassessment reflects broader economic concerns and shifting dynamics within the global smartphone market. Optimism surrounding Huawei is attributed to improved access to key components. </p>

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a sharp decline of up to 13% on Wednesday after the Toyota Group announced a 4.7 trillion yen ($33 billion) deal to take the company private. This move occurs amid increasing pressure on Japanese firms to dismantle long-standing cross-shareholding ties, a practice Toyota utilized in 2005 to fend off acquisition threats. The buyout involves a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries' shares at 16,300 yen each, lower than the previous closing price. Analysts anticipate further unwinding of cross-shareholdings within the Toyota Group in the future. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, effective Wednesday, signaling a continued aggressive trade strategy despite potential economic repercussions. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that President Trump is expected to discuss trade issues with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week. Simultaneously, the Senate is considering a significant bill to fund Trump's agenda, adding to the complex interplay of trade negotiations and domestic policy.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a U-turn on winter fuel payments, indicating that more people will be eligible for the allowance this year after a previous policy change was widely criticized. The payment, designed to help cover energy costs during the coldest months, was previously restricted to those on pension credit, excluding millions of pensioners. While details on the changes and eligibility criteria remain unclear, the government aims to address concerns about those with slightly higher incomes who still struggle with energy expenses. The announcement follows pressure from MPs and charities, with the government acknowledging the need for clarity on the policy. </p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, after a nine-year hiatus due to kitchen complexity. The returning wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a simplified version of the original. The company has launched a promotional webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, showcasing social media posts from fans who have long campaigned for its return. The decision to revive the Snack Wrap comes after a "years-long process," according to McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger, with fans even creating a Change.org petition that garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. </p>

          <p>President Trump is doubling tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from 25% to 50% in an effort to protect domestic workers, a move criticized for potentially increasing costs for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has also requested that Congress rescind $1.1 billion allocated for public broadcasters, a move seen as part of a broader clash with cultural institutions like NPR and PBS. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has suspended operations after a deadly shooting near its site, highlighting the ongoing crisis and restrictions on aid. The House version of Trump's tax bill includes sharp cuts to tax credits for electric vehicles, potentially hindering progress in reducing transportation-related emissions. </p>

          <p>The US has doubled tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to revive the American industry amid criticism from trading partners. This action follows President Trump's focus on the global steel and aluminum markets, particularly the dominance of China. The executive order formalizing the tariffs states they will counter foreign countries that off-load low-priced, excess steel and aluminum in the US market. The tariff applies to all trading partners except Britain, which has a preliminary trade agreement with the US. </p>
