          <p>China plans to remove tariffs on nearly all goods from 20 more African countries, excluding eSwatini, offering duty-free access to its consumer market. This initiative was announced during a meeting in China attended by African ministers, coinciding with criticism of the United States' trade policies. Chinese President Xi Jinping stated China's commitment to extending zero-tariff measures to 53 African nations with diplomatic ties, building upon a previous policy benefiting 33 least-developed African countries. Representatives from China and African nations jointly accused the U.S. of disrupting the global economic and trade order. This move underscores China's growing economic influence in Africa.</p>

          <p>The House is set to vote on a White House-backed rescission package that seeks to reclaim $9.4 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS. Speaker Mike Johnson is advocating for the measure as a way to cut wasteful spending and ensure government accountability, framing it as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts. The package proposes significant cuts to USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with the White House alleging that NPR and PBS spread radical propaganda. While Republican leaders are confident in the package's passage, some GOP lawmakers have voiced concerns, particularly regarding cuts to PEPFAR, a global HIV/AIDS relief program. This vote is an important signal regarding the fiscal priorities of House Republicans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests has sparked legal questions and a challenge from California Governor Gavin Newsom. Trump invoked Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, claiming the troops were needed to protect federal property and personnel, without invoking the Insurrection Act. California argues that the situation does not justify the use of federal troops and that Trump bypassed state and local leaders.

          <p>Council tax in England is projected to increase by 5% each year to fund local services, including policing, as indicated in the Spending Review documents. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 4.99% annually without central government approval, with the assumption that councils will implement the maximum increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that the 5% cap is not mandatory, but rather an option for councils to invest in areas like social care and policing. The Spending Review revealed a real-terms budget cut for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, although the government asserts that councils' core spending power will still increase if they maximize council tax revenue.

A resolution passed by the IAEA's board of governors carries the threat of an eventual referral to the UN Security Council.

The protests, organized by the coalition Sur de Europa contra la TuristizaciÃ³n, will take place in various cities, including Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. Activists argue that mass tourism negatively impacts the quality of life for locals, leading to noisy streets, air pollution, and the disappearance of traditional retail. The protests aim to challenge the "tourism-first culture" that prioritizes the tourism industry over the well-being of residents.</p>
