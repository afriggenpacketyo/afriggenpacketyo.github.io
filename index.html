          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. The motion passed with bipartisan support after three Republicans joined Democrats, defying their party's leadership. Republicans amended the subpoena to also seek communications involving former presidents and top justice officials. The move comes amid growing public pressure for transparency and follows the committee's separate subpoena for Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, to provide a deposition from prison.</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored the decisive extra-time goal against Germany to send her team to the Euro 2025 final. Her triumphant moment marks a remarkable personal comeback, as she was hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner struggled for form early in the competition but delivered a world-class finish in the 113th minute of the tense semifinal. Her performance, demonstrating skill and resilience, secured Spain's first-ever appearance in a Women's Euro final.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice has ruled that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant harm to the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions. The unanimous decision, prompted by a request led by the island nation of Vanuatu, states that existing international treaties and human rights laws compel nations to act with due diligence. While not legally binding, the ruling establishes a powerful legal precedent that could influence thousands of climate-related court cases worldwide and strengthen the position of smaller nations disproportionately affected by climate change.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched two identical satellites, known as TRACERS, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to provide critical data on "space weather," the phenomena that can disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts. The twin spacecraft will fly in tandem, allowing for precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The launch also deployed several other small satellites for various scientific and technology-demonstration missions.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger has been sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole after pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The sentencing followed hours of emotional victim impact statements from the families and surviving roommates of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves. Kohberger, who accepted a plea deal to avoid the death penalty, declined to make a statement in court. The judge called him a "faceless coward" and criticized his lack of remorse before imposing the sentence.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, a federal judge in Tennessee ordered that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be released from criminal custody while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Concurrently, a federal judge in Maryland barred Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from immediately detaining him upon release. The Maryland judge's order requires the government to give 72 hours' notice before any deportation proceedings and to return him to his prior supervised release status in Maryland.

          <p>South Korea successfully avoided a technical recession, with its gross domestic product expanding by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, surpassing economists' expectations.

The expansion was driven by a strong rebound in consumption and a 4.2% quarterly increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. The positive economic data comes as the country faces potential trade challenges, including a 25% U.S. tariff scheduled to take effect in August if a new deal isn't reached.

          <p>Shares of IBM declined after the company reported second-quarter results where its software revenue missed analyst expectations, despite overall earnings and revenue beating projections. The company's total revenue grew nearly 8% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its infrastructure and consulting divisions. However, the shortfall in the high-margin software segment, which executives attributed to clients reprioritizing spending toward hardware, concerned investors. IBM maintained its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a 42% drop in second-quarter profit, with earnings and revenue falling short of Wall Street estimates. The airline has been grappling with weaker domestic travel demand and is in the process of a major business model overhaul, including moving away from open seating. Despite the profit decline, the company stated that travel demand has stabilized and announced a new $2 billion share buyback program. For the third quarter, Southwest projects its unit revenue will range from a 2% drop to a 2% increase compared to last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A search warrant reveals that bomb squad technicians initially believed the grenades that later exploded, killing three Los Angeles County Sheriff’s detectives, were inert. According to the document, the technicians X-rayed the devices found in a Santa Monica storage unit and told local police they were non-functional before transporting them. The following day, at least one of the grenades detonated at a training facility as they were being handled, killing the three veteran detectives. The investigation by the Sheriff's Department and ATF is ongoing to determine how the tragic incident occurred.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with a plan to build a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet, a project that could significantly boost its geopolitical influence in South Asia. The dam is projected to be the world's largest, producing three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam, with much of the power intended for export. Chinese observers suggest this could help Beijing increase its sway over neighboring countries like Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, which often face power shortages. The project has also raised concerns in downstream countries, particularly India, about water security and strategic leverage.</p>

The revised outlook follows a second consecutive quarter of declining customer traffic, with second-quarter same-store sales shrinking by 4%. Executives attributed the slowdown to a broader consumer pullback amid economic concerns, though they noted that sales trends began to improve in June. The company's quarterly revenue rose 3% to $3.06 billion, primarily due to the opening of new restaurant locations. (not investment advice)</p>

This initiative is part of a broader effort to prevent advanced technology from reaching "countries of concern" and to maintain America's strategic advantage.

          <p>A geopolitical analysis suggests that in the event of a military conflict over Taiwan, very few countries would be willing to offer direct military assistance to either the United States or China. While China's only formal treaty ally is North Korea, its most useful strategic partner, Russia, is unlikely to intervene militarily. On the U.S. side, even key allies like Japan and the Philippines would likely offer only limited, cautious support, such as patrols or logistical aid. The article concludes that most nations would seek to remain neutral, reflecting a global lack of appetite for involvement in such a high-stakes confrontation.</p>

They state that the Israeli siege and military operations have made aid distribution untenable, with tons of supplies sitting untouched while the population starves.

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences. This proposal aims to stimulate the housing market, where sellers currently face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for married couples. The idea aligns with a bill recently introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, intended to help long-term homeowners, particularly seniors, access their equity without a tax penalty. While the move could benefit many homeowners, experts note the proposal would be costly and its congressional support is uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
