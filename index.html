        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may result in a reduction of 1,700 roles globally by 2027, aiming for Â£60 million in cost savings. This follows Â£40 million in cost-cutting measures announced in November. CEO Joshua Schulman is implementing this strategy to revive the brand's fortunes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment and geopolitical uncertainty. Shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, and sales fell less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, although they declined across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading before ultimately rising after the company revealed a share buyback program worth 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of common stock shares to shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster by some analysts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The judge stipulated that individuals facing removal must receive at least 21 days' notice in both English and Spanish, along with an opportunity to voice any objections.

          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including proposed tariffs and funding freezes, are creating uncertainty for the renewable energy sector in the United States. While the Inflation Reduction Act provided incentives for clean energy, tariffs on Southeast Asia could significantly impact solar energy development. Experts worry that these tariffs will increase costs for renewable energy companies and ultimately be passed on to consumers. Despite these challenges, clean energy is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace, with wind and solar capacity projected to increase significantly by 2035.</p>
