          <p>JPMorgan Chase alleges that financial technology middlemen, such as Plaid, are overwhelming its servers with excessive and often unnecessary data requests. According to an internal memo, the majority of these "API calls" are not initiated by customers for active transactions but serve other purposes, including data harvesting. In response to the rising costs of maintaining infrastructure and increased fraud risks, the bank is preparing to implement new fees for this data access, a move that could significantly impact the fintech industry's business model.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has discussed a European-led peace initiative for Gaza with U.S. President Donald Trump, following the breakdown of previous U.S.-led negotiations. The plan, developed in collaboration with France and Germany, aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. This diplomatic effort comes amid increasing domestic and international pressure on the UK to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, a move supported by a significant number of MPs.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. The core of their argument is that a non-prosecution agreement made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have protected Maxwell from criminal charges, as it allegedly extended to any potential co-conspirators. They contend that the government must honor this deal, arguing that its validity is not geographically limited and that failing to do so undermines the justice system's integrity.</p>

          <p>Portuguese forward João Félix, once the third most expensive transfer in history, is set to join Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, a move seen by many as an end to his potential at football's highest level. Despite a brilliant start at Benfica and high-profile moves to Atlético Madrid and Chelsea, the 25-year-old has struggled to consistently deliver on his immense promise. Journalists and coaches suggest a lack of defensive commitment and an inability to adapt have hampered his career, turning a player once destined for greatness into a cautionary tale.</p>

          <p>As more Americans face financial distress, this article outlines three major risks associated with filing for personal bankruptcy. A primary consequence is a significant, long-lasting negative impact on one's credit score, which can hinder future borrowing for up to a decade. Additionally, depending on the type of bankruptcy, individuals risk losing valuable non-exempt assets, such as property or investments, which may be liquidated to repay creditors. The process can also limit future professional and personal opportunities, making it a decision that requires careful consideration of all alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, lawyers for Donald Trump have asked a judge to compel the 94-year-old media mogul to be deposed within 15 days. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about a letter Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's legal team argues for the expedited testimony by citing Murdoch's advanced age and recent health issues, suggesting he may be unavailable to testify in person by the time the case goes to trial.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics. This ruling expands on a previous, more limited injunction and blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting off its Medicaid payments for one year. The judge noted that restricting access to Planned Parenthood's services, which include contraception and STI screenings for low-income patients, would likely lead to adverse public health consequences.</p>

The lawsuit, led by California and New York, argues the unprecedented request violates federal privacy laws and could create a "culture of fear" that deters people from seeking essential services.</p>

To maximize the body's absorption of iron from plant sources, it is best to pair them with foods rich in vitamin C.
