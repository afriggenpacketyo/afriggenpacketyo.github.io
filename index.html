          <p>Thousands of homes in Scotland remain without electricity and train services are suspended following Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Power company SSEN is working to restore supply to 22,000 properties after reconnecting 50,000, while Network Rail tackles numerous incidents on train lines caused by gusts up to 90mph. The storm also led to widespread flight cancellations, road bridge closures, and the suspension of events like the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The Scottish government is coordinating recovery efforts, urging caution as cleanup and repairs are expected to take considerable time.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing it to lower crude oil and chemical prices, although this was partially offset by increased trading volumes. The state-owned oil giant posted an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, slightly ahead of analyst expectations. Despite the revenue dip, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, projecting that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day in the second half of 2025. The company is also set to boost its output as OPEC+ partners unwind voluntary production cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the agency reported a disappointing gain of only 73,000 jobs in July and revised previous months' figures downward. Trump claimed the numbers were "rigged" without providing evidence, a move criticized for potentially undermining confidence in federal economic data. Concurrently, the administration has ordered criminal investigations into former officials like ex-CIA Director John Brennan and ex-FBI Director James Comey, as well as an investigation of former President Obama, signaling an aggressive push to settle past political grievances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent scientific research is exploring the connection between psychological stress and the aging process at a molecular level, finding that stress can induce changes in DNA similar to those seen in natural aging. A new hypothesis suggests that so-called 'zombie-like cells' could be a key mechanism through which the brain manages the effects of aging and stress. This area of study aims to better understand how mental states impact physical health and longevity. The article discusses the potential for future scientific interventions based on these emerging insights into the mind-body connection.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia collusion allegations. This legal step will determine if formal charges should be filed against individuals who may have conspired to falsely link the Trump campaign to Russia. The move follows the recent declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited a memo alleging a plan approved by Hillary Clinton to smear Trump. The proceedings revive the contentious 'Russiagate' debate and focus on the actions of Trump's political opponents during the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee have arrested three individuals and charged them as accessories in the murders of four people who were the parents, uncle, and grandmother of an infant found abandoned but alive. Dearrah Sanders, Tanaka Brown, and Giovonte Thomas are accused of assisting the primary suspect, Austin Robert Drummond, who remains the subject of an intense manhunt. Officials believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a relationship with the family. A combined reward of up to $30,000 is being offered for information leading to Drummond's capture.</p>

          <p>China's government has announced a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry and encourage consumption of local beef, as the sector faces falling prices and strong competition from imports. The policy, introduced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system to promote high-quality Chinese beef. This initiative is part of a wider strategy to bolster key agricultural sectors and enhance the appeal of domestic products. Officials noted that there is significant room for growth in high-quality protein consumption among Chinese residents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a report by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence by employers has been cited as a reason for over 10,000 job cuts in the U.S. through the first seven months of 2025. AI is now listed among the top five factors contributing to layoffs, which have surged this year, particularly within the technology sector. While other factors like federal budget cuts and retail sector pressures are currently having a larger impact, the data shows the tangible, early effects of AI on the labor market.

          <p>More than 40 people were arrested during a protest outside the Trump International hotel in New York City, organized by the Jewish-American anti-occupation group IfNotNow. Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered to demand an end to the war in Gaza and to pressure the U.S. government to ensure more humanitarian aid enters the territory, where starvation is a growing threat. Protesters, including prominent Jewish community leaders and public officials, held signs reading "stop starving Gaza" and "not in our name" before blocking the street in front of the hotel, leading to the arrests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted an injunction, ruling that the ban cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections. This legal setback forces Customs and Border Protection to revert to processing migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the administration's more restrictive emergency proclamation. The ruling is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over the administration's stringent immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Illinois and New York to block a vote on a contentious Republican-drawn congressional redistricting plan. By leaving the state, the Democrats denied the House the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business, effectively stalling the legislative session. The Republican House Speaker issued civil arrest warrants to compel their return, escalating a political standoff over maps that would likely add five new Republican-leaning seats to the U.S. House, a key goal for the national party.</p>

In response, the company has terminated its relationship with its farm labor contractors and hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to advise on employment eligibility verification.
