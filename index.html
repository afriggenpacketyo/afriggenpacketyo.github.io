          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 12:45:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led House passed a bill to codify President Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America,' with a vote of 211 to 206. The legislation, introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, directs federal agencies to update documents and maps accordingly. Democrats criticized the measure as a waste of taxpayer money, while Republicans argued it promotes American pride. The bill's future in the Senate is uncertain, requiring bipartisan support to overcome a filibuster, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune has not yet committed to bringing it to a vote.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on specific goods traded between the countries, though this is not a comprehensive trade deal. Tariffs on UK car imports to the US have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles annually, while tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there were no changes to the UK's digital services tax. The US has previously demanded the import tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated she is open to such a cut.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, political scientists argue that the United States has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. They cite the Trump administration's use of government agencies to target critics, including investigations of political opponents, punitive actions against law firms, and attacks on the media and universities. The authors contend that this has created a climate of fear and self-censorship, undermining democratic checks and balances, noting that this has occurred with even greater speed and force than equivalent actions taken by elected autocrats in Hungary, India, Turkey or Venezuela during their first years in office. They urge collective action from civil society to resist this authoritarian trend.</p>

The cryptocurrency's rise began overnight and continued after President Trump announced the agreement. Analysts suggest that market uncertainty and a pro-crypto administration are contributing to Bitcoin's resilience and safe-haven status. Rising tensions between India and Pakistan, along with the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, are expected to further test Bitcoin's resilience.</p>

          <p>Female athletes Stephanie Turner and Payton McNabb testified before Congress about keeping men out of women's sports. McNabb, who suffered brain injuries from a trans opponent, expressed shock at a witness's suggestion to prevent spiking in volleyball to avoid injuries. Turner, who refused to face a trans opponent in fencing, found comments about racial segregation offensive. The hearing involved shouting matches and questionable comments, leaving Turner and McNabb frustrated and offended.</p>

          <p>A report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that over four in ten universities in England expect to be in a financial deficit by this summer, driven mainly by a fall in international student numbers. Universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but the OfS said significant reform and efficiencies are needed to turn the tide. The report found that 117 of 270 higher education institutions registered with the OfS expected to be in deficit by the end of July.</p>

          <p>Economists have shifted back their forecasts for lower borrowing costs as President Trump‚Äôs tariffs raised the risk of higher inflation and slower growth. The Federal Reserve is waiting to see how President Trump‚Äôs policies would ripple through the economy before taking any action on interest rates. Economists are increasingly coalescing around September as the most plausible time for the Fed to restart interest rate cuts. The Trump administration is working against a July 9 deadline to mint trade deals with countries after pausing more onerous tariffs initially announced in April.</p>

Krispy Kreme is not planning to launch its doughnuts in any additional McDonald's locations in the second quarter, suspending a nationwide rollout. Sales fell below projections, and profitability appears to be the key reason for slowing the rollout with McDonald's. The company is also looking to prune its unprofitable locations, which could affect up to 10% of its U.S. network.</p>

          <p>In an Atlantic article, Arthur C. Brooks discusses the rise of loud egos in modern society and its correlation with declining well-being. He proposes cultivating a "quiet ego," defined as a self-identity that is neither excessively self-focused nor excessively other-focused, as a countercultural strategy for happiness. Quiet ego involves virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope, and is associated with better mood balance, superior life satisfaction, and a greater sense of life‚Äôs meaning. Brooks suggests practical steps for acquiring these virtues, including asking what others need and how to improve one's surroundings, and affirming the possibility of being wrong and detaching from emotions.</p>
