          <h2>Milwaukee Faces Lead Poisoning Crisis Amid Federal Health Department Restructuring</h2>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, leading to temporary closures and inspections after elevated lead levels were found in children. The city is struggling to address the issue due to a lack of funding and manpower to maintain older school buildings. Federal support from the CDC was initially available but was cut due to restructuring within the US Department of Health and Human Services. Milwaukee is proceeding with its own inspections and water line replacements but needs additional state or federal funding to complete the job, highlighting the challenges local governments face when federal expertise is no longer accessible. The city's health commissioner worries about the lack of federal support for future emerging health issues.</p>

          <p>Iran has condemned Austria following a report by Austria's intelligence agency that alleges Iran has an advanced nuclear weapons program capable of launching long-range missiles. The report contradicts U.S. intelligence assessments, which state that Iran has not yet begun a weapons program but has taken steps to be able to produce a nuclear device if it chooses to do so. In response, Iran summoned an Austrian diplomat, while Austria reiterated its and the EU's concerns about Iran's nuclear activities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also reported that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, raising concerns about Iran's intentions and adding tension to ongoing nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>Popular Mexican band Grupo Firme has canceled a performance in California after the U.S. government suspended the musicians' visas. The move follows a broader effort by the Trump administration to target Mexican artists who perform "narco-corridos," a genre that sometimes glorifies cartel violence. While Grupo Firme has taken steps to distance itself from this facet of the genre, the suspension highlights the challenges faced by Mexican musicians amid ongoing cartel violence and U.S. efforts to combat it. The U.S. State Department has revoked visas of a number of Mexican musicians for playing a genre of music that it says glorifies cartel violence.</p>

The WFP had brought 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza, but the trucks were stopped and food was taken by hungry people. The organization stated that after nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving and are no longer willing to let food pass them by. While Israel eased an 11-week aid blockade on May 19, the UN says the amount sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs.</p>

World Boxing is introducing mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers in their competitions. The decision to mandate testing came after controversy surrounding Khelif's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics, fueled by claims from the International Boxing Association that Khelif and another boxer failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. The organization said athletes need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic test to determine their sex at birth and their eligibility to compete.</p>

Hamas is still seeking other demands, including a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. The U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed the deal, which includes a 60-day ceasefire, and Israel had accepted Witkoff's proposal.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major review of its military and strategic defence, amidst growing concerns about a more dangerous global landscape. The review will likely emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, commitment to NATO, and modernizing the armed forces with technologies like drones. There is also expected to be a greater focus on national resilience, including a "whole society approach" to threats, with announcements about British industry creating more defence kit, expanding cadet forces, and bolstering military reserves. While the government claims the review will be transformative, others suggest its impact may be marginal, and questions remain about whether increased defence spending will be sufficient to meet current plans and address urgent threats.</p>

The trade group UK Steel warned that orders could be delayed or canceled, creating uncertainty for shipments already en route across the Atlantic. The UK government has stated it is engaging with the U.S. to provide clarity to the industry and finalize a trade deal that would eliminate UK steel import taxes. The increase in tariffs comes despite an agreement in May to drop import taxes on UK steel, which has not yet been finalized.</p>

          <p>A body has been found in the search for a girl who went missing in the River Thames in Kent. Police were called on Friday after concerns were raised for two children who had entered the river in Gravesend. A boy was retrieved from the water and taken to a local hospital and is in stable condition. Kent Police and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) recovered a body from the river, which has since been confirmed to be that of the missing girl.</p>

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports, warning that it "undermines" efforts to reach a "negotiated solution" in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson said that the EU is "prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to the latest U.S. tariff increase." The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement, stating it is a "direct attack on Canadian industries and workers." The EU said that it had paused its countermeasures against the U.S. on April 14 "to allow time and space" for negotiations, and is prepared to instate those measures "if no mutually acceptable solution is reached."</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple parenting rules to help navigate the complexities of modern parenting. The rules emphasize following instincts, culture, and the individual child, rather than relying on influencers or clickbait. The advice focuses on prioritizing enjoyment over strict development and being authentic rather than striving for an ideal self. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural traditions while also recognizing the unique needs and interests of their children.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Toxic Nation," produced by MAHA Films, highlights concerns about ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, pesticides, and fluoride, which the Make America Healthy Again movement says "silently endanger millions of Americans every day." The documentary follows the release of the first MAHA Commission report, which lays the groundwork for an overhaul of federal policy to reduce the burden of chronic disease on American children. The documentary's release comes amidst significant budget and staffing cuts at HHS and the US Environmental Protection Agency. While some experts have long discussed the effects of what we consume on our risk of disease, there is some controversy around the potential dangers, benefits or neutrality, if any, when it comes to specifics.</p>

          <p>Germany's radical right, including the AfD party, often presents itself as a defender of Christian values against Islam, but the relationship is more about political expediency than genuine faith. The AfD exploits Christian traditions to appeal to a broader audience, particularly by stoking fears about immigration and cultural change. However, the party's ties to the Christian churches are not strong, and its overtures to Christianity are primarily used to attack Islam and capitalize on social uncertainty. While some AfD politicians express devout Christian beliefs, the party's relationship with Christianity is largely instrumental and opportunistic.</p>

Handing these assets to Ukraine would be a significant blow to Putin, bolstering Ukraine's morale and financial stability. While some fear that confiscating the funds would undermine Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, the situation with Russia is an extreme case that should not deter decisive action. Seizing these assets would demonstrate a unified front against Russian aggression and provide much-needed support to Ukraine in its fight for survival.</p>

The IAEA stated it could not confirm whether Iran's program remains peaceful, and the report indicates Iran has been producing highly enriched uranium at a rate equivalent to roughly one nuclear weapon per month.
