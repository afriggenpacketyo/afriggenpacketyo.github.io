          <h2>Trump Claims Russia and Ukraine Nearing Agreement After Envoy's Moscow Visit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US President Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are nearing a deal following talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Trump described the negotiations as "constructive," while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized the need for "real pressure on Russia" to agree to a ceasefire. Reports suggest that the US peace proposal involves Ukraine ceding land annexed by Russia, including Crimea, which Zelensky rejects. The situation remains tense, with ongoing pressure on Ukraine to make territorial concessions as part of any agreement with Moscow. Optimism for a quick resolution is tempered by significant differences in proposed terms. </p>

          <p>Sources report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office established a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office provides remote access to his personal cellphone's Signal app and text messages, even within a SCIF where cellphones are prohibited. This arrangement has raised security concerns, especially after reports surfaced that Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen within a private Signal group. While a Defense Department spokesperson denies the existence of a "dirty line," sources maintain the setup poses a risk by granting access to personal communications within a secure environment.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities arrested a Wisconsin judge and a former New Mexico judge for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement efforts. Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest, while former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife face charges of harboring an undocumented immigrant with alleged gang ties. These actions mark an escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to remove undocumented immigrants, drawing criticism from those who view it as an attack on the independent judiciary. The FBI believes Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the individual they were attempting to arrest.</p>

          <p>China is taking a tougher stance towards Donald Trump's second term, reacting to his tariffs with countermeasures and fiery rhetoric, signaling a shift from its initial approach in 2017. Despite Trump's willingness to meet with Xi Jinping, there are no apparent prospects for such a meeting. China has become more assertive, attacking American "bullying" and seeking international support for its position, even reaching out to US allies. This hardened attitude may stem from experiences during Trump's first term and a reassessment of his strategic intentions.</p>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, urging him to reconsider his role in the Trump administration, fearing it is leading the U.S. towards authoritarianism. The letter argues that many of the administration's actions are unconstitutional and undermine democratic principles. Bessent responded by criticizing the signatories for waging their campaign from behind a keyboard rather than engaging in the real-life political process. The letter echoes a similar one sent to then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2017, highlighting concerns about the administration's actions and their impact on American democracy.</p>

Doge reports savings by cancelling contracts, grants, and leases from previous administrations. However, the evidence behind these savings is often overstated, with some figures based on projected spending rather than actual costs. For example, Doge claimed significant savings from cancelling a contract for a migrant children's facility, but the actual savings were much lower than reported.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. legislators has sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to prioritize the return of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea decades ago. The letter praises Trump for bringing the abduction issue into the global spotlight during his first presidency. The group urges Trump to work with Japan in engaging with the North Korean government to secure the release of the victims.
