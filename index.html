          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is implementing a "substantial" tariff on furniture, expected to raise consumer prices, alongside an investigation into furniture tariffs. Trump defended his administration's crime crackdown, stating he is not a dictator but knows how to stop crime, while also mentioning his preference for local officials to request federal assistance. Dan Scavino is succeeding Sergio Gor as director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, praised by press secretary Karoline Leavitt for his leadership. John Bolton criticized Trump's Ukraine policy in a new op-ed following an FBI search of his home and office related to classified records allegations. These developments highlight the administration's focus on trade, law enforcement, staffing, and foreign policy amidst ongoing scrutiny and criticism. This administration is forging ahead on multiple fronts. </p>

          <h2>Lisa Cook Plans Lawsuit Against Trump Following Fed Board Removal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 13:11:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook will file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Donald Trump, according to her lawyer, Abbe Lowell. The lawsuit will assert that Trump lacks the authority to remove Cook, citing a lack of factual or legal basis for the action. Trump's decision followed allegations of mortgage fraud made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte, which Cook denies, stating she will continue her duties. The Federal Reserve Act allows a president to fire a board member only "for cause," which is understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty. This legal battle could potentially reach the Supreme Court, raising questions about presidential power and the independence of the Federal Reserve. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for the Fed's autonomy. </p>

          <p>Whirlpool anticipates that President Trump's tariffs on imported steel and aluminum will provide a competitive advantage against foreign appliance manufacturers. The American company manufactures 80% of its products in the U.S. and sources 96% of its metal domestically, which leads to higher prices for consumers. Whirlpool hopes the tariffs will level the playing field with competitors like LG and Samsung, who use cheaper imported steel. The company is prepared to increase hiring and utilize AI to improve efficiency if demand for domestic appliances rises, positioning Whirlpool for growth amidst the trade war. This could help revitalize American industry and increase domestic manufacturing. </p>

          <p>State Representative James Talarico, a Democrat, attracted over 1,000 people to a "Blue Texas" rally in Plano, a Dallas suburb known for being Republican-leaning. The event was so popular that attendees filled two bars, prompting Talarico to deliver the same speech twice to accommodate the crowds. Notably, the attendees were not the typical older Democratic demographic but included younger individuals, indicating a potential shift in political engagement. This suggests a growing interest in Democratic ideals even in traditionally conservative areas of Texas, showcasing the potential for political change. The event highlights the evolving political landscape. </p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, met its main goal in a late-stage trial, aiding patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes in shedding weight. Patients taking the highest dose experienced an average weight loss of 10.5%, or 22.9 pounds, over 72 weeks, compared to 2.2% with a placebo. The company plans to file for approval of the drug globally, potentially launching it around the world next year, offering a needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 treatments. While existing injections have shown greater weight loss, the convenience and accessibility of an oral option are expected to expand access to obesity treatments. The pill also improved blood sugar levels and key cardiovascular risk factors. </p>

The Fed's independence is crucial for maintaining stable prices and promoting employment without political influence. Experts warn that political interference in monetary policy could create damaging economic cycles and undermine global investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

          <p>Texas schools, transformed into "relief hubs" after devastating floods, have reopened their doors to students. These schools provided shelter, food, and supplies to the community during the emergency. The turnaround to restore the buildings to their original purpose was momentous, involving volunteers who swept, vacuumed, and moved supplies. Educators now face the challenge of addressing the social and emotional needs of students who have experienced the tragedy. The schools are committed to providing support and care to help students heal and continue their academic growth. </p>

The sale will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 markets across the U.S. The deal is expected to close in mid-2026, pending regulatory approval. This transaction is part of EchoStar's efforts to resolve inquiries from the Federal Communications Commission regarding its compliance with federal requirements to build a 5G network. AT&T and EchoStar also agreed to expand their network services agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With credit card debt weighing heavily on household budgets, multiple tools can help manage and potentially eliminate that debt faster, including balance transfer credit cards, personal loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Balance transfers involve moving debt to a new card with a 0% promotional rate, while personal loans offer fixed monthly payments over a set period. HELOCs tap into home equity for a low-rate line of credit. The best choice depends on individual financial circumstances, debt amount, and repayment timeline. Each option has its own costs and potential drawbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Botswana's president, Duma Boko, declared a public health emergency due to shortages of essential medicines and equipment, exacerbated by a downturn in the global diamond market and US aid cuts. The Ministry of Health had suspended non-urgent surgeries due to shortages of medicines for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and other conditions. Boko announced 250m pula in funding for emergency medicines, overseen by the military, blaming the Central Medical Stores for inflated drug prices. The economic downturn in the diamond industry, which accounts for a significant portion of Botswana's GDP, has contributed to the problem. The country is a world leader in tackling HIV/Aids. </p>

He expressed frustration with the Democratic Party's perceived reluctance to engage in hard-fought political battles. Martin's comments reflect a broader sentiment within the party that Democrats need to be more assertive in opposing Trump's agenda. Democrats face an uphill battle to gain more power in Washington during the 2026 midterm elections. </p>

          <p>The CDC's "Tips From Former Smokers" ads, credited with helping millions quit smoking, are set to end in September due to Trump administration changes. The ads, featuring real stories of harm from smoking, directed people to free help at 1-800-QUIT-NOW, leading to increased quitline calls and long-term quits. Public health advocates warn that ending the campaign is a mistake that will cost lives and increase healthcare costs. State quitlines, many built with CDC support, face pressure and may cut services. The cuts are part of a larger overhaul eliminating or folding CDC's chronic disease work into a new agency. </p>

While President Donald Trump's tax law didn't change capital gains rates, new deductions could reduce taxable income for 2025, expanding eligibility for the 0% bracket. Trump's law also added a temporary $6,000 tax break ($12,000 for married couples) for older Americans, further reducing taxable income.
