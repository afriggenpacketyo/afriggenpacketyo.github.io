          <p>In an interview with Time magazine, President Trump asserted that he has secured "200 deals" on tariffs and has been in contact with Chinese President Xi Jinping, however he did not elaborate on the specifics of these agreements, leaving their nature and scope unclear. Chinese officials have disputed the White House's claims of active discussions, calling them "fake news," adding complexity to the administration's narrative on trade relations with China. Trump indicated that these negotiations would be finalized within the next three to four weeks, signaling a potentially swift resolution to ongoing trade tensions. The evolving situation highlights the administration's aggressive approach to trade and its potential impact on global economic dynamics.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's calls for a swift resolution in Ukraine, President Putin has intensified Russia's military actions, including airstrikes on civilian areas. Putin openly acknowledged bombing a restaurant, claiming it housed individuals deserving punishment, signaling a defiance of international norms and Trump's appeals. This situation presents a delicate negotiation dynamic, with Trump attempting to broker peace while Putin seemingly tests the limits of his patience. The Kremlin remains confident, even after Trump's public demand for Putin to halt the attacks, indicating a complex interplay of diplomacy and military strategy in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are raising prices on various products due to increased import costs resulting from President Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China. E-commerce software company SmartScout has tracked a 29% average price increase on 930 products on Amazon since April 9, affecting categories such as clothing, jewelry, and household items. The trade war with China threatens to disrupt Amazon's third-party marketplace, where many merchants rely on China for sourcing and assembling products.

          <p>The Chinese government is evaluating the possibility of waiving retaliatory tariffs on specific essential products imported from the United States. This consideration stems from concerns raised by businesses in China regarding the impact of the 125 percent tariffs on American goods, particularly those crucial to supply chains. Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, noted that some companies might exit the Chinese market if a prolonged tariff war continues.

          <h2>Trump's Transactional Approach Could Lead to New Iran Nuclear Deal</h2>

          <p>President Trump is seeking to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal, which he previously abandoned in 2018, and has dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to lead indirect negotiations with Iranian officials. While obstacles remain, including opposition from hardliners and Israel, Trump's transactional instincts and focus on economic benefits for American businesses may lead to a positive outcome. Iran has signaled a willingness to accept a verification-based approach, similar to the 2015 deal, and has attempted to appeal to Trump's ego and desire to be a peacemaker. If Trump resists pressure from hawkish advisors and Netanyahu, he may be able to repair the nuclear crisis he initiated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's renewed focus on immigration enforcement has gained traction due to a shift in public sentiment, driven by concerns over the influx of migrants under the Biden administration. Polls indicate that immigration is a relative high point for Trump, with voters more open to tougher policies, including deportations. This shift is evident in areas like Passaic County, New Jersey, where Trump overperformed in the recent election. However, some supporters worry that Trump's policies are becoming too extreme, particularly regarding the deportation of non-criminal immigrants.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that the Kremlin is "ready to reach a deal" with the U.S. on Ukraine, with some elements needing refinement, while noting that negotiations are ongoing and confidential.

Lavrov defended the strikes, asserting that Russia only targets military goals or civilian sites used by the military. Despite the ongoing conflict, Lavrov indicated positive signs in the talks with Ukraine, citing Trump's recognition of the need to address the root causes of the situation.</p>

          <p>An economic crisis looms as stock markets warn of a recession and bond markets anticipate inflation, signaling the potential return of stagflation. President Trump's tariffs are likened to self-inflicted oil shocks, disrupting the economy and causing prices to rise. The tariffs create uncertainty for businesses, leading to disinvestment and potentially resulting in higher prices, shortages, and layoffs. The grim reality of stagflation is that it is difficult to escape, requiring a complete overhaul of the current economic system.</p>
