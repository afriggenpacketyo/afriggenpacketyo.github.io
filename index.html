          <p>The UK government will, for the first time, publish the nationalities of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, following pressure from the Conservative party. Official data indicates an increase in foreign offenders awaiting deportation since the Conservatives left office. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has directed officials to release data on the nationalities and crimes of those awaiting deportation by the end of the year, with the most common offenses being drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault. The government insists this action was only possible due to Cooper's overhaul of Home Office systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring Asian countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, causing diplomatic friction with China and South Korea, which were invaded by Japan during World War II. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba sent a ritual offering but did not attend in person. The cross-party group typically visits the shrine during the spring and autumn festivals, despite criticism from China and South Korea.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is causing central banks worldwide to navigate a complex situation, weighing the benefits of currency appreciation against potential risks to export competitiveness and economic stability. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially amidst renewed U.S. tariffs. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks of capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. administration. For now, most central banks appear to be avoiding a currency war that could further destabilize the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This growth occurs despite the US-China trade war and potential impact from increased tariffs. Private businesses contribute to over half of China's exports, with a significant trade value reported in the first quarter. However, analysts note that private and small businesses are more vulnerable to US tariffs compared to state-owned enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget that would eliminate a nearly $1-billion financial gap by cutting over 2,700 city positions, including approximately 1,650 layoffs. The plan includes funding for new hires at the Fire Department but would result in deep spending reductions and layoffs in other agencies, including the LAPD. The LAPD would see a reduction of over 400 civilian workers and a continued decline in the number of police officers. Union leaders have vowed to fight the layoffs, and the City Council will deliberate on the budget in the coming weeks.</p>
