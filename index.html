          <h2>Treasury Yields Plummet Amid Trump's Tariff Announcement</h2>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields experienced a significant drop following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, triggering a flight to safety among investors. The 2-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level since September 2022, while the 10-year yield also declined. Trump's tariffs, which impose a baseline 10% tariff across the board and higher rates for specific countries, have stoked fears of a global trade war as major trading partners retaliate. Traders are now anticipating multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 in response to the economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)<br/><i></p>

          <p>Digital philosopher Jaron Lanier argues that the current discourse around AI is misleading, framing it as an independent intelligence rather than a collaborative tool. He suggests that treating AI as a 'god' hinders its development and obscures the human sources of its data, making quality control and authentication more difficult. Lanier critiques the pursuit of passing the Turing test as a goal detached from economic usefulness and user benefit. He advocates for a new internet business model that incentivizes and values human contributions to AI, rather than prioritizing advertising and manipulation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced sweeping new tariffs on goods imported into the US, claiming they will boost the American economy and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, paid by companies bringing the goods into the country. Economists warn that these tariffs are expected to push up prices for US consumers and could potentially harm the global economy. Major trading partners are considering retaliatory measures, raising the specter of a global trade war.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariff policy is unpopular, especially among young voters, voters of color, and independents who prioritized economic concerns in the 2024 election.

Polling data reveals a growing disconnect between Trump's MAGA base and other Republican voters regarding economic approval. Trump's focus on immigration over the economy may alienate these crucial voters, jeopardizing the future of his popular majority.</p>

          <p>California colleges are grappling with the Trump administration's cancellation of visas for dozens of international students, with campus officials claiming they were caught off-guard. UCLA and other UC campuses have confirmed visa revocations, citing violations of visa program terms, but the government has not provided detailed reasons. Students are facing uncertainty and anxiety, and universities are scrambling to provide support and legal aid. The cancellations have raised concerns about the administration's treatment of international students and potential immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Families caring for elders, especially those with Alzheimer's and dementia, need structural support in the form of accessible and affordable day programs. These programs provide respite for caregivers, enrich the lives of elders, and are a fiscally responsible solution compared to in-home care or memory care facilities. However, many areas lack sufficient day programs, and inadequate reimbursement rates threaten the viability of existing ones. Without increased investment in elder care, aging Americans and their caregivers will face dire consequences.</p>

          <p>Top House Republicans and other politicians are increasingly backing President Trump and Elon Musk's attacks on U.S. judges who have stalled some of Trump's executive orders and Musk's slashing of federal agencies. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan have echoed some of Trump's attacks, and a subcommittee hearing explored ways to curb judges who have stymied Trump's policies. Campaign donations from Musk, the world’s richest man, are likely to boost Republican candidates in 2026 races, increasing pressures on members from Trump and Musk to accelerate efforts to rein in dissident judges.</p>

          <p>Despite the potential for Trump's tariffs to raise prices, eliminate jobs, and shrink retirements, Corporate America is unlikely to mount a significant challenge to the Republican party's governance. The U.S. lacks a unified business lobby capable of coordinating such a challenge, and individual firms are more likely to pursue their own interests through lobbying efforts. The structural crisis of American liberalism has weakened the mechanisms that once aligned state policy with corporate interests, leaving organized labor as the primary force to resist Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose large tariffs on foreign imports has triggered a global trade war and predictions of an imminent recession, with some economists fearing the U.S. is at risk of slipping into stagflation. This is characterized by stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. Trump's tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, choking off access to affordable goods and materials from overseas, likely leading to higher prices and slower growth. While some factors may mitigate the impact, the potential for stagflation is a significant concern. (not investment advice)<br/><i></p>

Whether Trump is open to deals or intends to fundamentally rewire global trade will determine the future direction of markets and economies.
