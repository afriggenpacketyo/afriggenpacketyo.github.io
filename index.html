          <p>The UK government is launching a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses and supporting key industries. The plan, which includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, intends to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK manufacturers by exempting them from green energy levies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the strategy as a turning point, emphasizing support for sectors with high growth potential and the creation of over one million new jobs. The strategy also includes upskilling initiatives, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, during the upcoming summit in The Hague. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, emphasizing that 3.5% should be allocated to pure defense and 1.5% to security-related infrastructure. While some nations are prepared to meet this target, others are hesitant, raising concerns about whether these commitments will translate into concrete action. The call for increased spending comes amidst ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, which are threatening global economic stability, with some analysts deeming this year's meeting as the most consequential in the alliance's history.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran conflict has escalated with the U.S. military striking three Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting a surge in oil prices and widespread international concern. Following the U.S. strikes, Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global oil transit, causing oil prices to jump by over 2%. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait, as China is Iran's largest oil customer. Analysts predict oil prices could reach $100 a barrel if the Strait is closed and Western forces attempt to reopen it by force.</p>

Palmer, known for his alleged involvement in melting gold from the 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery and for scamming thousands in a timeshare fraud, was found unconscious by his son and his son's girlfriend. Essex Police believe a contract killer watched him through a spyhole in his fence, before scaling the fence and shooting him at the only spot not covered by CCTV. The police are hoping that changing loyalties within the "criminal fraternity" may encourage individuals to come forward with information.</p>

          <p>The NHS is exploring the potential of using ketamine to treat severe depression, with an NHS Lothian psychiatrist hoping to establish a clinic by the end of the year. This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The use of ketamine is being considered as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), offering another option for patients with hard-to-treat depression.</p>

          <p>Two brothers are attributing their sister's death to their mother's anti-medicine conspiracy theories, which led her to refuse conventional cancer treatment. Paloma, a Cambridge graduate, was diagnosed with cancer but declined chemotherapy, opting instead for alternative therapies promoted by her mother, Kate Shemirani, a former nurse known for spreading misinformation. The brothers believe social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation, as these views are becoming more mainstream. The BBC investigation reveals how Kate Shemirani's influence and online presence contributed to Paloma's decision, highlighting the dangers of conspiracy theories in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are facing criticism for their feeble and complacent response to the escalating conflict between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, which has been described as a calamitous unraveling. The leaders are accused of being passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom or address the root causes of the conflict. The article argues that their pronouncements about diplomacy sound hollow in the face of ongoing violations of international law and human rights. The author asserts that these leaders are unsuited to crisis, prioritizing the maintenance of a failing world order over justice and human life.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is setting ambitious goals for member states, placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. NATO plans for member states to spend 5% of their economic output on defense, a significant increase from the current 2%. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, there is debate within the coalition government about the rationality of setting GDP percentages for military spending. The summit will also focus on military capabilities, requiring additional troops in Europe and the formation of new military units within the German armed forces.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, aiming to appease U.S. President Donald Trump and deter Russia. Secretary-General Mark Rutte has been instrumental in gaining support for this goal, particularly from Germany. The push for increased spending, potentially reaching 5% of GDP, has raised concerns about social cuts and economic priorities in some European countries. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been invited, his aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to be a central focus of the summit, leading to potential disappointment for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran is struggling after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained his wife, a Mexican national, who was still breastfeeding their 3-month-old baby. Paola Clouatre, who entered the U.S. seeking asylum as a child, was detained during a green card application meeting due to a deportation order issued in 2018. The case highlights the Trump administration's strict immigration enforcement policies, which have reduced discretion for military families and led to increased deportations. Advocates argue that the situation is particularly unjust given the veteran's service and the impact on his young children.</p>

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to voters' second choices. This process continues until only two candidates remain, with the one having the most votes declared the winner. The system aims to ensure broader support for the elected candidate and prevent fringe candidates from winning with a small plurality, although the complexity of the system can make races less predictable and requires voters to do more research.</p>

          <p>A video has surfaced showing a landscaper, the father of three Marines, being violently detained by masked federal agents in Orange County. The man, Narciso Barranco, was allegedly pepper sprayed, beaten, and had his shoulder dislocated during the arrest. His son, a Marine veteran, expressed outrage at the use of force, stating that his father had not received medical treatment, food, or water after more than 24 hours in detention. The incident has sparked public outcry, and a GoFundMe campaign has been created to assist with legal representation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team overcame a goalkeeping gaffe by Matt Freese to defeat Haiti 2-1 and win their Concacaf Gold Cup group with a perfect 3-0 record. Malik Tillman scored the opening goal, but Freese's error allowed Haiti to equalize before Patrick Agyemang scored the game-winning goal in the 75th minute. The U.S. team, largely comprised of a B team, had already secured a spot in the quarter-finals against Mexico or Costa Rica. The Gold Cup serves as the last competitive test for the Americans before the World Cup, which they will co-host.</p>
