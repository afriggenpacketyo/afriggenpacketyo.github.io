          <h2>Japan's Ruling Coalition Loses Upper House Majority, Prime Minister Vows to Remain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a recent election. Despite the significant setback, which reflects public frustration over rising prices and other economic pressures, Ishiba has stated he will not resign. The defeat weakens the coalition's political influence, especially after losing its lower house majority last year. This result could lead to political instability and potential leadership challenges within the Liberal Democratic Party, impacting crucial trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically diversified its business to become a formidable leader in the artificial intelligence sector. The company has expanded into various complex fields, including AI chips, data centers, and smart cars, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. This evolution was partly fueled by U.S. sanctions, which inadvertently pushed Huawei to innovate and gain significant state backing as a national champion. Analysts highlight Huawei's comprehensive approach, covering the entire AI value chain from hardware to industry-specific applications.</p>

          <p>A bizarre and spectacular car accident in Bohmte, Germany, has left two people, including a seven-year-old boy, with serious injuries. The car reportedly veered off the road at high speed, crashed through a hedge, and landed on a trampoline in a backyard where the child was playing. The impact apparently launched the vehicle into the air, causing it to lodge in the roof of a nearby barn about three meters off the ground. A female passenger and the boy on the trampoline were severely hurt, prompting a massive emergency response.</p>

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across various industries in China, from electric vehicles to food delivery, driven by price-sensitive consumers in a sluggish economy. While these discounts offer immediate benefits to buyers, they are squeezing corporate profits and contributing to deflationary pressures. There are growing concerns about the hidden costs, such as potential compromises on product quality and safety as companies cut corners. Chinese state media and the government have begun to criticize this "race to the bottom," vowing to regulate irrational competition.</p>

          <p>A protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, which houses asylum seekers, escalated into what police described as "mindless thuggery," leading to six arrests. Over 1,000 demonstrators gathered, with some throwing bottles and smoke flares at police vehicles. The unrest follows the recent charge of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual assault, which has heightened local tensions and drawn protesters from across the UK. Police implemented dispersal and face-covering removal orders to manage the disorder, warning that they will act quickly against any criminal behavior while respecting the right to peaceful protest.</p>

          <p>Popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, known as GLP-1s, are showing significant potential for treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women.

While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, experts see promise in GLP-1s, although larger clinical trials are needed to confirm their efficacy.

          <p>President Trump has stated he may block a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the "Redskins." In a social media post, Trump claimed there is significant demand for the name change, which was originally dropped in 2020 following years of criticism that it was a racist slur. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, as Congress passed legislation giving the city control over the proposed stadium site, which was signed into law earlier this year.</p>

The surge is largely attributed to low vaccination rates, particularly within certain communities, fueled by post-pandemic vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.

The poll also reveals that most Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts.

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers clashing with striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham, resulting in numerous injuries and 95 arrests. The subsequent criminal case against the miners collapsed amid allegations that police falsified evidence. The inquiry aims to answer questions that have remained for 40 years, bringing a measure of justice to the affected miners and their communities.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's recent victory at The Open Championship has cemented his position as the most dominant force in men's golf, drawing frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods in his prime. This was Scheffler's fourth major title, and he has achieved this milestone in the same amount of time it took Woods. His peers and analysts point to his machine-like consistency, mental toughness, and ruthless ability to close out tournaments as "Tiger-like" qualities. A key factor in his recent success has been a significant improvement in his putting, transforming a previous weakness into a major strength.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This office is responsible for analyzing environmental hazards like toxic chemicals and water pollution, providing the scientific basis for regulations. The move is part of a broader plan to downsize the federal government and will reportedly save over $748 million while cutting 23% of the EPA's staff. Critics have condemned the decision, warning it will cripple the agency's ability to protect public health and safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has begun humorously warning audiences to be camera-ready before the band performs its "Jumbotron Song." This new practice follows a viral incident at a previous show where the camera focused on a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and an HR executive from the same company, who appeared to be having an affair. The resulting online fallout led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by their tech company. Martin's playful warning is a lighthearted acknowledgment of the segment's potential for creating unintended real-world consequences.</p>

          <h2>Child Development Expert Emphasizes Teaching 'Self-Connection' as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert argues that teaching "self-connection" is the single most important skill for a child's success. Self-connection is the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions and needs, which builds resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The expert warns that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Instead, she advises validating emotions, welcoming a child's full self, and modeling self-awareness to foster a strong sense of self-worth that protects long-term mental health.</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller, through his nonprofit Better Angels, is pioneering a new model to build affordable housing without taxpayer subsidies by making it profitable for private investors. Using a $300-million fund, the initiative provides equity to finance projects, aiming to build faster and cheaper than traditional developments that rely on slow government grants and tax credits. While resulting rents may be higher than in subsidized units, the goal is to create new housing for low- to moderate-income renters. The model seeks to prove that market-based capitalism can be harnessed to address the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 criminal trials have faced a major setback with the cancellation of plea deals for the alleged orchestrators, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for guilty pleas and life sentences, potentially bringing closure to the case. Now, the prospect of a trial seems even more distant, as the controversial manner in which the deals were overruled is expected to trigger years of new litigation. Legal experts suggest that without a plea agreement, the case will likely remain mired in pretrial hearings, delaying any final resolution.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died in a tragic accident after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine at a medical facility on Long Island, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a heavy metal chain when he entered the MRI room. The machine's powerful magnetic field immediately drew him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." MRI facilities have strict protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects due to the immense force of the magnets, which can turn metallic items into dangerous projectiles or, in this case, pull a person into the machine.</p>
