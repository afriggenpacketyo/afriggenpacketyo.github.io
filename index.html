          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, describing it as a "spectacular military success" aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities. The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with B-2 bombers using Massive Ordnance Penetrators and submarines launching Tomahawk missiles. The U.S. communicated to Iran that these strikes were the extent of their planned actions and that regime change was not intended. The strikes followed increasing tensions between Iran and Israel, with Iran vowing retaliation if the U.S. intervened, and Homeland Security is monitoring for potential reprisals.

          <p>A 27-foot boat capsized on Lake Tahoe due to a large swell, resulting in six fatalities and two missing individuals. The incident occurred near D.L.

The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office, California State Parks, and South Lake Tahoe Police Department are involved in the ongoing investigation and search.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, lawmakers from both parties expressed mixed reactions. Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham and House Speaker Mike Johnson supported the action, while Democrats such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Mark Warner criticized the lack of congressional consultation. Some lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the strikes altogether, arguing it was not America's fight, and some Democrats argued that the strikes were unconstitutional. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between executive power and congressional oversight in matters of war.</p>

          <p>The United States' decision to bomb Iranian nuclear sites has fundamentally altered the course of the conflict between Israel and Iran, prompting questions about Iran's potential response. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu praised President Trump's decision, while Iran has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. military intervention. The article notes that while Israel has been conducting its own attacks, only the U.S. possesses the ordnance necessary to neutralize Iran's most heavily protected nuclear facilities. The future escalation of the conflict hinges on how Iran and its allies choose to react to this significant development.</p>

          <p>Despite suggesting a two-week window for diplomacy with Iran, President Trump had already decided to bomb Iranian nuclear sites, according to sources familiar with the decision. Trump's statement was a feint to keep Iran off guard, as the U.S. government prepared for potential Iranian retaliation by evacuating citizens from Israel and dispersing military assets. The strikes were coordinated with Israel, and Trump was reportedly impressed by the success of Israel's offensive, believing a U.S. push would ensure success. The administration now faces the possibility of Iranian retaliation, potentially through cyberattacks or disruptions to shipping.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News analyzes President Trump's decision to launch strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, questioning whether it was a strategic triumph or a potential trap. The author notes that the administration has not provided public evidence that Iran was weeks away from building a nuclear bomb, and that bombs cannot erase knowledge. Iran is likely to retaliate, potentially through regional attacks, disruption of oil routes, or asymmetric attacks abroad, and the strike could backfire politically by unifying the regime. The piece concludes that the U.S. must prepare for volatility and that the key question is whether the strike was worth the cost.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. A survey using the test kits detected a tumor in the lungs of a woman and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas of six others. The test detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, making it valuable in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, which seeks balance between yin and yang to maintain health and harmony.</p>

          <p>After their son, Blaze Bernstein, was murdered by a neo-Nazi, a California family transformed their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward." Blaze was targeted because he was gay and Jewish, and his killer, Samuel Woodward, was a member of a violent hate group. The family promotes positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, and they have received hundreds of hand-painted stones with messages of tolerance, love, and peace. Woodward was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>The BBC analyzes President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Iran and Israel, noting that this action contradicts his promise to be a "peacemaker." The article suggests that Trump's rhetoric had put him in a difficult position to back down, potentially leading to a continued American military engagement. It also questions whether the two-week negotiation period was a feint or if behind-the-scenes negotiations collapsed. The analysis concludes that Trump's gamble is fraught with risk, both at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump ordered a U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities just days after stating he would decide "within the next two weeks" whether to do so, ostensibly to allow diplomacy a chance. He dismissed talks held in Geneva between European diplomats and Iran's foreign minister, indicating that Iran only wanted to speak to the U.S. Trump also contradicted his own intelligence community, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.
