          <p>Former President Joe Biden has launched a fundraising initiative for his presidential library, which will be located in his home state of Delaware. A 13-person governance board, including former aides and political allies, has been established to oversee the project, which faces the challenge of raising significant funds in a divided political climate. The library aims to feature an immersive museum detailing his presidency and serve as a center for civic engagement and leadership. The project's cost is anticipated to be substantial, following the trend of increasingly expensive presidential libraries.</p>

          <p>An opinion article scrutinizes First Lady Melania Trump's recent advocacy for integrating artificial intelligence into children's education, suggesting her involvement may be misguided. The author argues that while Mrs. Trump presents herself as a champion of responsible innovation, her past legislative support, such as for the Take It Down Act, has been criticized by civil rights groups for potentially stifling free speech. The piece contends that the Trump administration's broader actions, like defunding public education programs, contradict the stated goal of responsibly managing AI's growth for children's benefit. The author expresses skepticism that these initiatives will serve equity rather than enriching tech executives aligned with the administration.</p>

          <p>An environmental non-profit live-streamed a dive to the bottom of Lake Tahoe using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), offering thousands of viewers a rare look at one of the deepest lakes in the United States. The event aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem, its ancient geological history, and the environmental challenges it faces from pollution and tourism. Experts on the stream discussed the lake's ecological importance and dispelled popular myths about mafia bodies, instead highlighting the need for conservation efforts. The dive was part of ongoing initiatives to clean up trash from the lakebed.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in her first televised interview, asserted that the court's rulings are not merely opinion polls reflecting the justices' personal values. Promoting her new book, she stated the court's duty is to interpret what the American people have decided through the democratic process, not to impose its own beliefs. Her comments come as the court faces criticism and considers a request to overturn the legalization of same-sex marriage, a decision that would follow the controversial reversal of national abortion rights. Barrett emphasized the need for justices to tune out external criticism and focus on legal interpretation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a significant stake in PepsiCo and is urging a major strategic overhaul to boost the company's underperforming stock. In a detailed presentation, Elliott argues that PepsiCo's North American beverage business has suffered from strategic errors, such as retaining its bottling operations and failing to reinvest in core soda brands. The firm recommends refranchising the bottling network, divesting weaker brands like Quaker, and refocusing investment on high-growth areas to restore profitability and market value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting, challenging the conventional wisdom that homeownership is the primary path to wealth. After owning four properties, she and her husband sold them to return to renting, a move she claims accelerated their wealth accumulation by freeing up capital for investment and reducing the stress of property management. Joy argues that homeownership involves significant hidden costs, such as maintenance and renovations, and that being a landlord can be an emotional and logistical burden. She emphasizes that renting provides greater lifestyle flexibility and mobility, which has allowed her to focus on growing her income.</p>

These types of fires often occur in remote areas, allowing them to grow larger and produce more dangerous smoke, worsening public health crises. Experts warn this trend will further strain already thin firefighting resources and could have cascading effects, including flash floods in burn scars.</p>

          <p>A recent National Conservatism conference in Washington D.C. featured a speaker list that included senior Republican figures and Trump administration officials alongside theocratic Christian nationalists and far-right publishers. Critics argue the event demonstrates the increasingly blurred distinction between the mainstream Republican party and extremist ideologies. Speakers included a founder of a far-right publishing house and members of a secretive, men-only ultranationalist network. The conference's agenda and rhetoric, which included anti-immigrant sentiment and themes of male grievance, underscore the influence of the "new right" movement on contemporary conservative politics.</p>

          <p>With gold prices surging to new records this year amid economic uncertainty, many investors are looking to add the precious metal to their portfolios. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as the most liquid and cost-effective method. This approach is considered more efficient than purchasing physical gold bars or coins, which involve higher transaction and storage costs. While gold is seen as a safe-haven asset, advisors typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is scheduled to be canonized as the Catholic Church's first Millennial saint. Known for his "normality" as a video-game-playing, website-building teen, Acutis has been embraced by the Church as a modern example of faith for young people. However, his life also contained deeply traditional and mystic elements, including a profound devotion to the Eucharist and a self-imposed limit of one hour of video games per week. His story represents a unique junction for the Church, blending contemporary, tech-fluent youth with ancient, supernatural beliefs.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural phenomenon "Hamilton" is being re-examined as it arrives in movie theaters, with its legacy now viewed through the lens of a shifting political climate. Initially celebrated during the Obama era for its hopeful, immigrant-centric narrative of America, the musical's optimistic tone now feels different in the context of the Trump presidency. An academic expert suggests the show's first act mirrored the hope of the Obama years, while its tragic second act, filled with political fracture and violence, feels more resonant today. The article explores how critiques of the show's historical accuracy have also become more mainstream.</p>

          <p>A Ventura County jury has convicted a couple, Margarita Jimenez and Jorge Garfias, of first-degree murder for the killing of Garfias's ex-girlfriend, Yanelly Vargas, in March 2024. Prosecutors said the pair lured Vargas from a bar, beat her in an alley, and then pursued her in a truck before Jimenez shot her in the chest. Key evidence presented at the trial included a trail of blood, a spent shell casing, and broken acrylic nails found at the scene that were matched to Jimenez. The motive was believed to be Jimenez's jealousy of Vargas.</p>

After initially denying the problem, officials verified the situation and partnered with a local pastor, Billiance Chondwe, to connect thousands of patients with government-run clinics to resume their life-saving medication. While access to drugs has improved, the disruption has created new hardships, as patients and laid-off clinic workers now struggle with food insecurity since U.S.-funded programs also provided nutritional support.

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning that Venezuelan military aircraft will be "shot down" if they endanger U.S. naval vessels operating in the Caribbean. The threat follows reports of Venezuelan jets flying near a U.S. ship for the second time in two days, escalating tensions in the region. This development comes after a U.S. strike on an alleged drug-trafficking boat from Venezuela. The Trump administration has intensified its anti-drug operations in Latin America, deploying more naval assets and fighter jets to the area, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro accuses the U.S. of seeking regime change.</p>

          <p>The 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-Black unit known as the "Harlem Hellfighters," has been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest civilian honor. The regiment was celebrated for its bravery and extended service on the front lines of World War I, fighting alongside the French army due to segregation in U.S. forces. Despite their battlefield renown, their contributions were largely ignored for decades. The honor comes amid a national debate over how American history is taught and remembered, with some historians noting the irony of celebrating the soldiers while the current administration reviews museum content to promote "American exceptionalism."</p>

          <p>The Board of Immigration Appeals has upheld a Trump administration policy that denies bond hearings to immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization, a ruling that could subject millions to mandatory detention. The decision binds immigration judges, who previously had the discretion to release individuals they did not consider a flight risk or public danger. Immigrant rights advocates argue the policy is designed to pressure detainees into giving up their legal cases and accepting deportation, as they may be held for years while their cases proceed. The policy is currently being challenged in federal court.</p>

This exchange marks a point of tension between the chief and the civilian oversight board, which expressed concern about encounters with individuals with weapons or in mental health crises.

          <p>New Trump administration policies are causing widespread confusion and making it difficult for many Americans, including vulnerable seniors, to receive COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA has limited its official approval of the latest shot to those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions, forcing many others to get a prescription or attest to their eligibility at pharmacies. This has created hurdles and led to some eligible individuals being turned away, sparking frustration as COVID-19 cases rise in several states. The situation is exacerbated by a lack of clear recommendations from the CDC, whose vaccine advisory committee has been recently overhauled.</p>

This move is the latest controversy involving HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously promoted unsupported claims about autism.
