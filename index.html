          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced his intention to swiftly approve a controversial GOP redistricting bill, which recently passed the state Senate after a prolonged House standoff. This Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats have pledged legal challenges, asserting the new map undermines fair representation and dilutes minority voting power. The measure also prompted California Governor Gavin Newsom to introduce a counter-redistricting plan to flip five of California's seats from Republican to Democratic.</p>

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza on Saturday killed at least 33 people, including those sheltering in tents and seeking food aid, as a leading authority declared famine gripping Gaza City. This dire announcement intensified international calls for a ceasefire, but Israel dismissed the famine claims as false and continued preparations for a Gaza City offensive. Ceasefire negotiations remain on hold as mediators await Israel's next steps, while the Gaza Health Ministry reports over 62,000 deaths since the conflict began. Protests against far-right Israeli security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir highlight internal divisions over the war's direction.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with his deputy, Christine Bordine, taking over as acting director. This unexpected dismissal, for which no reason was given to Congress, has sparked concerns about the politicization of intelligence work within the Trump administration, especially following a DIA assessment of Iranian nuclear strikes that contradicted President Trump's claims. Additionally, two other senior Navy officials and a Major General were also recently removed from their posts, reportedly without consultation from top military leaders. The sudden changes have left DIA employees unsettled and questioning the administration's motives.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Ronnie McDowell revealed he suffered a stroke during a live performance in Pennsylvania this summer, telling his son he believed he was "having a stroke" while onstage. Doctors later confirmed the stroke, caused by a nearly 80% blocked artery, but credited his strong heart for his survival, allowing him to travel home for surgery. Despite complications from the procedure and anesthesia, McDowell is recovering and expresses profound gratitude for the outpouring of fan support. The 75-year-old singer, known for hits like "The King Is Gone," now holds a renewed appreciation for life after the health scare.</p>

          <p>American golfer Patrick Cantlay delivered a stellar back-nine performance, including four birdies in his last five holes, to shoot a 64 and tie Tommy Fleetwood for the lead at the Tour Championship. Fleetwood, who previously held a strong position, recovered from a double bogey with late birdies to maintain his share of the lead, setting up a compelling final day. Both players are at 16 under par, with a two-shot lead over Russell Henley. Cantlay's strong showing further solidifies his potential Ryder Cup captain's pick, while Fleetwood aims for his long-awaited first win on American soil.</p>

          <p>The United States immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since President Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first decline in more than 50 years. A Pew Research Center study indicates the number dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force. This trend is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations and restrictions on asylum applications. The analysis also highlights a significant decline in immigration from Mexico, while India and China remain the next largest origin countries.</p>

The resort, built near a missile testing site, features hotels and a water park, but its construction has faced criticism over alleged worker mistreatment. While aiming to boost tourism, Pyongyang limits foreign access, particularly for non-allies, to manage internal perceptions of wealth disparity.</p>

Despite the drama and the attorney's request for adjournment, the parole board proceeded, ultimately rejecting both brothers' requests for release.

Companies cite ambiguous policies, unresolved questions about duty collection, and insufficient time to establish new logistics systems as the primary reasons for the pause.

          <p>Major US retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are navigating the impact of President Donald Trump's increased tariffs by implementing creative mitigation strategies to avoid widespread price hikes for consumers. While some tariff costs have been absorbed or passed on selectively, companies are diversifying sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and strategically raising prices on new or high-demand merchandise. Consumer spending remains steady but selective, with lower-income households more sensitive to price changes. Despite concerns, retailers expect the pinch from duties to be less severe than initially feared, though costs are projected to continue rising through the second half of the fiscal year.

          <p>Germany is facing diverse challenges, including widespread anxiety about artificial intelligence, with one in three Germans fearing job displacement. The Catholic Church reports a "brutal" increase in vandalism at places of worship, signaling growing hostility. Politically, debates continue over sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine and Chancellor Merz's call for austerity cuts, which could strain the ruling coalition. Berlin also saw the renaming of a street with a racist history to honor Black philosopher Anton Wilhelm Amo. Additionally, a rise in antisemitic attacks since the Gaza war and issues with Afghan resettlement visas reflect ongoing social and humanitarian concerns.</p>

          <p>Turkey's First Lady Emine Erdogan has written to Melania Trump, urging her to extend her advocacy for children to those suffering in Gaza, where a UN-backed report confirmed famine and a high risk of malnutrition for 132,000 children. Erdogan highlighted the "irreparable wounds" caused by the conflict, calling for a united voice against injustice and a direct appeal to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the humanitarian crisis. This diplomatic move comes as Israel denies famine in Gaza and prepares for a new offensive, with the health ministry reporting dozens of deaths, including children, from recent attacks and malnutrition.</p>

          <p>Alcohol consumption among drinking-age Americans has reached its lowest point since 1939, with only 54% partaking and even those drinking less, according to a Gallup poll. This cultural shift, driven by increasing perceptions of alcohol as unhealthy, is significantly impacting major producers like Molson Coors and Constellation Brands, which report volume declines. Experts suggest this trend could be the early stages of a "Big Tobacco" moment for the alcohol industry, forcing companies to adapt to changing consumer behavior. The industry faces unprecedented pressure to innovate and find new strategies in a shrinking market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies ace Zack Wheeler has been diagnosed with venous thoracic outlet syndrome and will require additional surgery, sidelining him for six to eight months. This prognosis, following a previous surgery to remove a blood clot, means the 35-year-old pitcher is unlikely to start the 2026 season on time. Wheeler, a two-time Cy Young Award runner-up, was having another strong season with a 2.71 ERA and leading the National League in strikeouts. His significant injury is a major blow to the Phillies and a personal setback for one of the league's top pitchers.</p>

Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's "nice pace to his game" and the impact he made.
