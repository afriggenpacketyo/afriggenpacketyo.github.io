          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-01 04:22:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds expressed confidence in the UK's ability to overturn upcoming US trade tariffs.  He highlighted ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration, suggesting the UK is better positioned than other countries for a reversal.  However, he acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the US's willingness to compromise and the potential need for UK retaliation if tariffs are imposed. The potential impact of these tariffs on the UK economy, particularly on big tech firms, is also discussed.</p>

          <p>The Georgia legislature passed the "Riley Gaines Act," prohibiting transgender girls from participating in girls' sports.  The bill mandates that student athletes compete on teams aligning with their biological sex, extending restrictions to restrooms, locker rooms, and sleeping quarters.  Named after Riley Gaines, a former collegiate swimmer who criticized transgender participation, the act is expected to be signed into law by Governor Brian Kemp.  The bill mirrors similar legislation in over 25 other states.</p>

          <p>A seven-figure settlement has been reached in over 20 legal claims of historical sexual abuse at Celtic Boys Club.  The settlement covers approximately 70% of the cases brought by former players against Celtic Plc.
