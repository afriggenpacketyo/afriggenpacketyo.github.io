The attack, perpetrated by an Egyptian citizen who yelled "Free Palestine!", injured twelve people and is part of a disturbing trend. Brian Levin notes a shift towards more violent attacks, with anti-Jewish hate crimes reaching record levels in recent years. This violence is attributed to factors like the Israel-Hamas war and unregulated online environments, leaving Jewish communities feeling under siege and prompting increased security measures.</p>

The company has faced setbacks including a $6 billion write-down on its cable television networks and a lawsuit from President Trump over edits to a "60 Minutes" interview. The lawsuit has caused internal divisions, particularly regarding Redstone's desire to settle the suit, potentially influencing the FCC's review of the Skydance takeover.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering allowing Iran to continue low-level uranium enrichment for an unspecified time as part of a proposed nuclear deal. The proposal includes restrictions such as preventing Iran from building new enrichment facilities, dismantling critical infrastructure, and halting nuclear centrifuge research. In exchange, Iran would be allowed to participate in a regional enrichment consortium for civilian purposes and reduce its enrichment concentration to 3%. This proposal aims to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons while establishing auditing and oversight mechanisms.</p>

The ruling, by Judge John Holcomb, limits the administration's practice of deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. Holcomb stated that the government has not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation, differing from other judges who questioned the legality of using the act against gang members. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, requiring the government to provide individuals with an opportunity to challenge their deportation under the law.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart's success with its collectible character Labubu to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty, suggesting the Chinese toymaker could redefine cultural exports. Labubu's popularity has surged, attracting fans like David Beckham's family and boosting Pop Mart's stock. The character's appeal lies in its lovability rather than its connection to Chinese culture. JPMorgan Chase notes similarities between Labubu and Hello Kitty in character design, business model, and merchandising, with Pop Mart experiencing significant international sales growth.</p>
