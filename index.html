          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to cut its workforce by over 3,000 employees and shutter its Office of Research and Development. The administration frames this as a move to streamline government operations and save taxpayers approximately $749 million, while opening a new office focused on applied science. However, critics, including the EPA's employee union, warn that closing the research office will devastate the agency's ability to assess and protect public health and the environment. This action follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that facilitated mass layoffs within the federal government.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, found solace during the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow, an image inspired by a music box from his sister. After struggling with PTSD upon returning home, he decided to make his vision a reality to find personal healing. Over 26 years, he restored a broken-down carousel and hand-carved new animals for it, opening the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, in 2010. The nonprofit has since brought joy to over a million visitors and provided its creator with profound purpose.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, citing significant public interest. This move follows President Trump's directive to Attorney General Pam Bondi and comes amid criticism of the administration's handling of the case. Concurrently, Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's parent company over a story about an alleged "bawdy" note he sent to Epstein. The developments reflect growing pressure from supporters and political opponents for greater transparency on the matter.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation sets consumer protection guardrails and allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents, including the president, hailed the act as a revolutionary step for financial technology that strengthens the dollar and provides clarity for the crypto industry. The signing follows a week of legislative activity in Congress dubbed "Crypto Week" by Republicans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A general contractor in Los Angeles reports significant labor shortages on construction sites, attributing the problem to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Many undocumented but highly skilled workers are reportedly avoiding job sites out of fear of ICE raids. This is exacerbating delays and increasing costs, particularly as the region needs to rebuild over 12,000 homes destroyed in recent fires. A UCLA Anderson Forecast report supports this, noting that deportations will deplete the state's construction workforce, where 41% of workers are foreign-born, ultimately leading to higher costs for consumers.</p>

If these larger subsidies expire, the average amount consumers pay could rise by over 75%, potentially causing many to become uninsured.

          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild leg swelling, the White House physician has described President Trump's condition as "benign and common." CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. The condition affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often caused by weakened vein valves, with risk factors including age and prolonged sitting or standing. For mild cases like the president's, treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as compression, elevation, and exercise to manage symptoms like swelling and aching.</p>

Experts advise the public to avoid agitating the insects and offer tips for coexisting, such as leaving a small, sweet distraction away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>An internal crisis at the BBC's "MasterChef" has resulted in the dismissal of both its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode. An investigation upheld over 40 claims against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, and one claim against Torode for using an extremely offensive racist term on set. The article reveals that nine other unsubstantiated complaints were also made against Torode. The fallout has exposed tensions between the BBC and the production company, Banijay, and has left the future of already-filmed seasons in doubt, though the BBC insists the popular format will continue.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case has become a focal point for many in the MAGA movement, serving as a symbol for a perceived corrupt "deep state" that protects a powerful, criminal elite. This belief is rooted in long-standing conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and QAnon, which posited that a cabal of elites controls global institutions. For these supporters, the case is less about Epstein himself and more about uncovering a hidden system of control. President Trump's past promises to release files on the case have fueled these expectations, creating a difficult political situation as his administration's actions are now under intense scrutiny from his own base.</p>

          <p>A new comedic stage play, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has opened in Liverpool, reimagining the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." The show, written by "Motherland" co-creator Helen Serafinowicz, is a humorous homage to the couple, loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring. The play portrays the Rooneys as a heroic warrior and princess on a quest, with the creators insisting it is an affectionate and silly tribute rather than a targeted satire.</p>

This new initiative covers infants born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine, which has been offered to pregnant women since last September. Health officials stated the new vaccine, which offers 80% protection, will help reduce pressure on the health service during the winter months.</p>

          <p>This article revisits a remarkable story from 2005, when a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was reportedly rescued by a pride of lions after being kidnapped. The girl had been abducted by men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports at the time, three lions chased the captors away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found by police. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for the sound of a lion cub, preventing the animals from attacking her in what many considered a miracle.</p>

          <p>The announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being seen as a major blow to the traditional late-night talk show format. While CBS cited financial pressures, the move has drawn scrutiny for its timing, coming days after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount's settlement with President Trump. The format faces declining viewership among younger audiences, falling ad revenue, and competition from social media clips and politically polarized alternatives. This article explores whether the decades-old desk-and-sofa model can survive in a fragmented media landscape where its cultural relevance and financial viability are increasingly in question.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a potential trigger for ulcerative colitis, finding that an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a common gene variant can cause an overactive immune response. Researchers found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria over-activates an inflammatory protein called STING. This leads to the chronic inflammation characteristic of the disease. The discovery helps explain the unpredictable nature of colitis and opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

The loss of this funding threatens their ability to provide essential local news, emergency alerts, and educational programming. The interview highlights the tangible consequences of the legislative decision, which could lead to reduced services or even station closures in areas with few alternative media sources.</p>

The clip, which showed the pair quickly hiding their faces when they appeared on the big screen, led to online speculation that the individuals were CEO Andy Byron and Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot. The band's lead singer, Chris Martin, joked at the time that they were either "having an affair, or they're just very shy."

The film avoids commentary, instead using a patient, minimalist style to capture both the ornate, quiet rituals of preparation and the gruesome, bloody reality of the bullring. The review notes that the film forces viewers to confront the spectacle's inherent cruelty and its defiance of modern sensibilities. By focusing on the unflinching details, the documentary presents a powerful and honest portrayal of the ancient, controversial tradition without taking an explicit side.</p>
