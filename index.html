          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, with a primary focus on bolstering economic ties and regional security cooperation. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, Arab countries anticipate Trump's visit will promote greater economic engagement, particularly in defense, artificial intelligence, and advanced weaponry. Discussions will also cover regional security, including a potential US-Iran nuclear deal and the situation in Yemen, while the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal remains stalled due to the Gaza conflict. Analysts suggest Trump's "big announcement" during the trip will likely align with US business interests, promoting trade and investment opportunities in the Gulf.</p>

          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. The 91-year-old former emperor showed no symptoms during the tests, but will require careful follow-up care. Akihito was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito stepped down from the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Launched in 1972, a rocket malfunction left the spacecraft stranded in Earth orbit, and it has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts anticipate the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, may partially survive its descent. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, encompassing a large portion of the globe, and the risk of injuries on the ground is low.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, significantly expanding immigration enforcement. The order calls for deputizing state and local law enforcement, former federal officers, and other individuals. This initiative raises questions about funding and logistical challenges, as the current deportation force is much smaller. The administration also aims to encourage migrants to leave voluntarily through "Project Homecoming," offering financial assistance for self-deportation, while warning of potential fines, wage garnishment, and confiscation of property for those who remain.</p>

          <p>Changes to "de minimis" trade rules, which allowed low-value packages to enter the US without tariffs, are causing concern among consumers and businesses. President Trump's decision to end the exemption, combined with new trade tariffs, has led to price hikes and potential shortages. The move has sparked panic buying among shoppers and warnings from e-commerce brands about potential failures of smaller firms. While some support the change for safety reasons, others fear it will disproportionately affect lower-income households and benefit large retailers.</p>

This involves increasing exports, dominating supplies of essential goods, and using economic tools like export controls and blacklists. While the strategy has given China leverage in the trade war with the United States, it has also strained relationships with trading partners and comes at a cost to Chinese households.
