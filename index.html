        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While Chevron's CEO celebrated the affirmation of corporate merger practices, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess. The resolution ends a period of uncertainty that had weighed on Chevron's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Olga Khazan's new book, "Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change," details her personal journey to overcome introversion and social anxiety. As a self-described introvert, Khazan decided to tackle her loneliness by enrolling in an improvisational comedy class, a concept that felt like "full-immersion insanity." The article recounts her initial discomfort with improv exercises like "Zip Zap Zop" and juggling invisible objects, contrasting the class's forgiving atmosphere with her high-pressure job. It frames her experiment as a deliberate effort to step outside her comfort zone to foster personal growth.</p>

          <h2>Report Ranks the Ten U.S. States with the Poorest Infrastructure in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:56:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study evaluating U.S. state infrastructure has identified the ten states with the weakest systems, despite a recent national upgrade to a 'C' grade. The analysis considered factors like road and bridge conditions, power grid reliability, broadband access, and resilience to severe weather. Maine was ranked as having the worst infrastructure overall, primarily due to its unreliable power grid, while states like Alaska, Hawaii, and New Hampshire also received failing grades for issues ranging from poor connectivity to inadequate air travel options. The report highlights that significant investment is still needed to overcome decades of neglect in these regions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 33 people have been killed and dozens more injured by lightning strikes in India's eastern state of Bihar amid powerful monsoon storms this week. The majority of the victims were agricultural workers, and the state government has issued safety warnings and announced financial compensation for the families of the deceased. India's Meteorological Department predicts the heavy rainfall and storm conditions will persist for several more days. Scientists cited in the article connect the increasing frequency and intensity of lightning to climate change, noting rising temperatures fuel more powerful thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Palestinians in Gaza City have taken to the streets to protest a severe hunger crisis and the skyrocketing cost of basic necessities. Protesters expressed exhaustion and desperation, highlighting the extreme inflation of food items like flour and lentils, which have become unaffordable for many displaced families. According to UNICEF, child malnutrition diagnoses in Gaza have increased for the fourth consecutive month, with thousands of children affected. The protests occur as ceasefire negotiations continue, following Israel's recent lifting of an 11-week aid blockade, though significant aid restrictions remain.</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly distinguishing themselves from other major U.S. carriers, capturing over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to a strategic focus on premium cabins, lucrative loyalty programs, and expansive international networks, which have helped them weather a challenging market better than their rivals. While domestic airfare is falling and creating difficulties for other airlines, both Delta and United have seen strong revenue from their premium and international offerings. This strategic separation is positioning them as the dominant forces in the American airline industry for the foreseeable future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German farmers have significantly reduced the land dedicated to growing asparagus and strawberries, leading to the lowest harvest volumes for these crops in recent history. According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, harvests for both are at 15- and 30-year lows, respectively, as farmers struggle with rising production costs, particularly wages. This trend is turning these seasonal favorites into luxury items for consumers, with prices for both having increased substantially. While demand remains high for the culturally significant crops, growers report that production is becoming increasingly unviable without premium pricing from direct sales.</p>

Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, found a river landscape dramatically altered by time and the rise of railroads. Despite the changes and the squalor of the steamboats, he felt a profound sense of homecoming in the pilot house, a place he associated with ultimate freedom. The experience highlighted a central paradox of his life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for his past.</p>

Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the outlooks remain above late 2024 levels.

Now, as he tries to shut down speculation about the Epstein files, his followers, whom he conditioned to distrust institutions, are turning on him.

The camp director also reportedly waited over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe flood warning. Furthermore, the camp had successfully applied to have numerous buildings removed from FEMA's 100-year flood map, allowing it to operate in a known risk zone. The tragedy highlights a chain of missed opportunities and regulatory shortcomings.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their Glastonbury performance. The investigation was launched after comments and pro-Palestinian messages displayed on stage drew controversy. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The band had previously described the investigation as "political policing intimidation." The decision to even allow the group to perform had been a point of contention in the weeks leading up to the festival.</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching their highest point in over a decade, this article examines whether precious metal investors should consider shifting their focus from gold to the more affordable alternative. It notes that while silver offers similar protections against inflation and a lower entry price, its value is not historically comparable to gold. The article suggests that a complete switch is likely unwise, but the current market provides a timely opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their precious metal allocations. It reinforces the traditional advice of limiting such investments to a small portion of an overall portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated that it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-funded factories in Mexico will be excluded from the benefits of the USMCA trade agreement when it is reviewed next year. David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor at the Mexican Embassy in China, believes that any revisions to the deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting specific countries. This would mean companies might need to source more of their product locally to qualify for preferential treatment. The statement comes amid ongoing trade rivalry between the United States and China, which has raised questions about supply chain dependencies.</p>

          <p>Brazil's supreme court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and has banned him from using social media or contacting others under investigation. The measures are part of a trial where he is accused of plotting to overturn the 2022 election results and are reportedly aimed at preventing him from fleeing the country. The decision came as his home was searched and follows threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose steep tariffs on Brazil to pressure authorities to drop the case.

          <p>Amy Shack Egan, a two-time founder and mother, argues that the "hustle and grind" culture of the startup world is not built to accommodate motherhood. Egan, who launched her latest venture while pregnant with twins, criticizes the expectation that founders must work around the clock and abandon their personal lives. She recounts being told by a potential investor that they only take weekend calls to test a founder's commitment, a practice she finds unacceptable. In her view, the system is rigged against female entrepreneurs, who often bear a disproportionate share of family duties, making it essential but difficult to build a life outside of work.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company Neuralink identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing just before a funding round valued it at $9 billion. The April 24 filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) occurred while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative aimed at cutting federal agency spending. An SDB designation, which can grant preferential access to federal contracts, requires a business to be majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The filing by the company, led by the world's wealthiest person, has drawn scrutiny, as the Department of Justice has previously fined companies for false SDB claims.</p>

Newsom's jab connects the controversial prison proposal with the political fallout from the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein case, which has caused a rift in the MAGA movement.

This high engagement is vital for profitability, as retaining subscribers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Major platforms like Disney, Netflix, and Paramount are leveraging their deep libraries of kids' content, while also partnering with YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to maintain audience engagement and discover new talent.</p>
