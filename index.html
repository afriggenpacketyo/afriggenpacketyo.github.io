          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear oral arguments on May 15 regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. The Trump administration appealed after lower courts blocked the order, which reinterprets the 14th Amendment to deny citizenship to children born to undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas. Multiple states and immigrant rights groups sued to block the order, arguing it's unconstitutional. The administration argues the rulings are overly broad, raising important constitutional questions about border security.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has filed a motion with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay an injunction issued by a U.S. District Judge regarding the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant. The government argues that the injunction, which facilitates Abrego Garcia's release from a prison in El Salvador, is unconstitutional and exceeds the Supreme Court's authorization. This marks the second appeal by the Department of Justice against the judge's orders, focusing on differing interpretations of what constitutes facilitating his release.</p>

            <p>The Census Bureau is experiencing significant staff departures due to pressure from the Trump administration to reduce its workforce, raising concerns about the reliability of U.S. statistics.

Staffers are facing deadlines for early retirement and voluntary separation offers, potentially leading to mass firings. Experts worry that the loss of experienced personnel will hinder the bureau's ability to produce timely and accurate data, including the monthly jobs report.</p>

            <p>Margaret Nyamumbo, founder of Kahawa 1893, a coffee company importing beans from Africa, anticipates potential price disruptions due to President Trump's tariff policies. While her company initially seemed better positioned due to lower tariffs on African countries, even the baseline 10% tariff could significantly impact the low-margin coffee business. The new policies create uncertainty for businesses previously benefiting from tariff-free trade under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, raising concerns about its renewal. Nyamumbo states that if tariffs remain, Kahawa 1893 will have to increase prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Senator Mitch McConnell stated that he is "not yet convinced" that President Trump's tariff policy is the best approach, despite hoping for its success. Speaking in Kentucky, McConnell emphasized his long-standing opposition to tariffs and highlighted historical examples of their failures. While expressing support for Trump's overall success, McConnell has occasionally challenged the President's policies, including votes against some Cabinet nominees. He reiterated his commitment to strengthening U.S. global leadership while emphasizing the importance of alliances.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is facing a constitutional crisis due to President Trump's actions, including asserting the power to eliminate federal agencies and withhold funds allocated by law. The administration's claim of authority to imprison individuals in a foreign prison without due process is particularly alarming. Cases involving the Alien Enemies Act and Kilmar Abrego Garcia highlight the administration's disregard for court orders and due process. The future of American constitutional democracy hinges on whether the government complies with the law and respects judicial authority.</p>

            <p>School leaders are grappling with a Trump administration directive requiring them to recertify their commitment to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prevents race-based discrimination, or risk losing federal funding. The order argues that DEI programs may violate civil rights laws but lacks clear definitions. States are responding differently, reflecting a lack of consensus on what constitutes DEI. Some legal experts question the order's legal standing. The threat of investigations has created a "chilling effect" in classrooms.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Google possesses a monopoly in online advertising technology, marking the second antitrust case the company has lost in a year. The Department of Justice and 17 states sued Google, arguing its dominance illegally controls ad placement. Google plans to appeal. The judge stated Google "wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts." Google argues publishers choose its tools for their simplicity and effectiveness. This ruling could lead to structural changes within Google's advertising operations.</p>

Despite solid batting stats and six home runs, Ohtani has few opportunities with runners in scoring position. Manager Dave Roberts hopes the bottom of the lineup will improve, providing Ohtani with more chances to drive in runs.

            <p>Shein and Temu, popular Chinese e-commerce sites, will raise prices for U.S. consumers due to President Trump's increased tariffs on imports from China and the elimination of the "de minimis" import loophole. The companies, known for their low-cost items, primarily sell apparel and accessories. The "de minimis" exemption previously allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, but its elimination will impact their business models.
