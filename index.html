          <p>A four-year mystery surrounding an unexpected guest at Michelle and John Wylie's Scottish wedding has finally been resolved, thanks to an internet sleuth. The couple discovered a complete stranger in their wedding photos and, despite quizzing family, friends, and venue staff, could not identify him. The mystery man, Andrew Hillhouse, was revealed to have accidentally arrived at the wrong venue after being given incorrect directions to a different wedding two miles away. He only realized his mistake when the bride walked down the aisle, leading to a humorous account of him trying to blend in and later escape the unexpected ceremony. This article details the amusing resolution of a long-standing local enigma.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney shared insights into his Manchester derby experiences on his BBC podcast, including the "horrible" 6-1 defeat to Manchester City in 2011, a game he felt was a significant statement from City. He humorously recalled the awkwardness of attending his pre-planned birthday party with rival City players like Joe Hart and Gareth Barry that same night, admitting he "should have cancelled" despite family commitments. The article also touches on his iconic overhead kick goal from a game he felt he played "so bad," and discusses the unique pressures faced by children of professional footballers, including his son Kai and Shaun Wright-Phillips' daughter.</p>

          <p>A Turkish court is set to decide on Monday whether to remove Ozgur Ozel, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), a move critics fear could lead to the collapse of Turkey's multi-party system. This pivotal ruling follows a nearly year-long legal crackdown on the CHP, which has seen hundreds of members, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, jailed on alleged corruption and terrorism links. The centrist CHP vehemently denies these charges, viewing them as politically motivated attempts to erode their leadership and bend the judiciary to President Erdogan's will. The article underscores the high stakes for Turkish democracy and Ozel's political future.</p>

          <p>Steve Reed, the newly appointed Housing Secretary, has strongly affirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, declaring it "what we're going to do." He outlined a "build baby build" strategy, threatening sanctions on developers who delay projects, though specific penalties remain undefined. Industry leaders, however, warn of a "huge challenge" to meet this target, citing mounting pressures from rising regulatory costs, taxes, and planning application delays. Opposition parties have expressed deep skepticism, suggesting the government's housing pledges "are for the birds" and accusing them of being anti-business.</p>

          <p>Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of Stephen Lawrence, has made a poignant plea for new witnesses to provide information about her son's 1993 racist murder, as an official review, triggered by a BBC investigation, commences.

          <p>A comprehensive BBC Verify analysis, drawing on interviews with numerous international law experts, reveals a broad consensus that Israel's military operations in Gaza have been disproportionate. Experts cite the tens of thousands of civilian casualties, extensive destruction of buildings, and severe restrictions on food supplies leading to famine conditions as key evidence. While Israel asserts its inherent right to self-defense and adherence to international law, the article highlights the contested nature of its legal arguments, particularly regarding the scale of its overall response and individual actions. The International Criminal Court has also issued arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas leaders, underscoring the gravity of the allegations.</p>

Despite these huge expenditures, the report concludes that the care provided is often inappropriate and does not offer value for money, citing a "dysfunctional" profit-driven market. Many children are placed far from their local authority, disrupting their lives and education, as evidenced by Ezra Quinton's experience of 60 different placements. The Department for Education acknowledges the systemic failures and pledges the "largest ever reform" of children's social care.</p>

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung expressed bewilderment and concern that the raid could deter future foreign investment in the US, noting that sending workers for factory setup is common practice. Hyundai's chief executive anticipates a two to three-month delay in the factory's opening due to the incident. This article highlights the significant diplomatic fallout and economic impact of the US immigration crackdown on a key ally, straining bilateral relations.</p>
