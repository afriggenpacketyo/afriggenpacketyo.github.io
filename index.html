          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancient Human Migration from Asia to the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 02:04:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of researchers has conducted an extensive genetic analysis, tracing the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas. The study indicates that Native Americans descended from Asian populations, particularly those in the West Beringian region. It also found that early migrants to South America formed distinct, isolated groups because of environmental conditions. This research provides insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have experienced significant population declines, and confirms human presence in South America as early as 14,500 years ago.</p>

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is speaking out about the need for regulation of artificial intelligence, particularly concerning the use of her likeness and voice by AI companies.

Johansson's legal team took action against OpenAI, leading to the removal of "Sky." She emphasizes the importance of establishing boundaries to prevent AI from being detrimental and advocates for more public figures to support AI regulation.</p>

          <p>Official data reveals that Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a 0.2% drop compared to the previous quarter, marking the first decline since early 2024. The contraction was largely driven by a fall in exports, influenced by waning demand and new tariffs imposed by the United States. Uncertainty surrounding trade policies is expected to further impact the economy, raising concerns about a potential recession. The aging population and rising welfare costs also contribute to Japan's economic vulnerabilities, despite the central bank's efforts to adjust interest rates.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large dark patch has appeared off the coast of Rio de Janeiro near Barra da Tijuca Beach. Biologist Mario Moscatelli attributes the stain to urban growth and inadequate sanitation, leading to sewage flowing into rivers, lagoons, and eventually the sea. The color of the patch appears greenish due to the presence of cyanobacteria, a type of algae that thrives in unhealthy conditions with high sewage content. The article indicates that the sewage flows down the rivers, into the lagoon, and from the lagoon into the sea, contributing to the pollution.</p>

Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania consistently performs poorly on key social indicators, with a large portion of the population at risk of poverty. The article highlights the lack of genuine economic alternatives offered by mainstream politicians, contributing to the country's slide towards the far right, with Simion favoring policies that cater to the domestic business class.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, who diversified away from the U.S. due to uncertainties surrounding the U.S. economy. Japanese assets are generally considered a haven, whose appeal rose as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground in April.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the country after receiving a removal order in 2005. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) charged the woman $500 for each day she remained in the U.S. since the order was issued. The case represents an enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced. The woman's attorney plans to appeal the fine, arguing she was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S.</p>

          <p>A statewide transit strike in New Jersey began after midnight on Friday, as locomotive engineers walked off their jobs in a dispute over pay, shutting down New Jersey Transit‚Äôs rail network. The strike is expected to disrupt the lives of tens of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan region. NJ Transit‚Äôs statewide bus system continued to operate as scheduled, and the agency hired private buses to substitute for its train service, but they can only accommodate about 20 percent of the displaced train riders. Transportation experts said the impact of the rail shutdown would ripple across other transit systems and add to congestion on the roads in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a "shock absorber" of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances. While recent talks have led to a reduction in tariffs and a respite in market turmoil, economists suggest that Europe faces a bleak outlook if it fails to adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade with China and the rest of the world. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.</p>
