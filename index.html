          <p>Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stated that his vision of victory in Gaza involves its complete destruction and the displacement of civilians to a "humanitarian zone" in southern Gaza, with the ultimate goal of them leaving to third countries. Smotrich also expressed his desire for the formal annexation of the West Bank before the end of the current government's term. Paris and Beijing have voiced their opposition to Israel's plans to escalate its offensive in Gaza. This statement reflects a hardline stance within the Israeli government regarding the future of Gaza and its Palestinian population.</p>

          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, has announced his opposition to President Donald Trump's nomination of Ed Martin to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Tillis cited Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases as his reason for not supporting the nomination. This decision likely dooms Martin's chances of Senate confirmation, as Tillis's vote could prevent the nomination from even being reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term will expire soon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang was unlawful, marking the second time a judge has blocked the administration's use of the AEA. The judge granted a preliminary injunction in the case of two plaintiffs who were being deported to El Salvador based on suspected gang affiliation. The judge stated that the administration's invocation of the AEA exceeded the scope of the law, as there was no evidence of a "war," "invasion," or "predatory incursion" justifying its use.</p>

The exchange occurred amidst tense discussions on trade relations, with Trump questioning the United States' trade deficit with Canada. Despite the disagreement on statehood, both leaders maintained a polite disposition, though Trump hinted that Carney's stance could complicate trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise that even with a $1,000 credit limit, individuals should strategically manage their spending to avoid maxing out their credit line. Most experts recommend keeping credit utilization below 30% of the total credit limit, meaning spending no more than $300 on a $1,000 credit card. Maintaining a low credit utilization ratio helps improve credit scores and demonstrates responsible borrowing habits to lenders. Using a credit card to accumulate points or rewards is acceptable, but responsible spending habits are key to avoiding unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coterra Energy is cutting back on its oil drilling in response to sagging crude prices and spending more on natural gas production. However, this move is being overshadowed by some operational concerns, leading to a stock sell-off. While executives explained their plan to fix the issue, the stock may struggle to gain traction in the near term. Coterra is still worth owning as a geopolitical hedge and offering some exposure to long-term trends that could drive increased natural gas demand, such as artificial intelligence computing and growing U.S. exports of liquified natural gas.

Baraka led a predawn protest outside an immigrant detention facility, trying to prevent it from becoming a critical part of the Trump administrationâ€™s ability to enact mass deportations. Baraka argues that the facility's owner, GEO Group, began operating without the required permits. The early morning protest led to a tense standoff, and Newark fire officials issued the prison company three citations for code violations. Baraka vowed to return to the facility daily, asserting that the city will ensure the facility follows local rules and laws.</p>

This resulted in a collision that became an 11-bike crash with oncoming riders unable to avoid the fallen bikes. Jenner was treated at the track but died from "a catastrophic head injury," and Richardson was also treated at the track and taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital with severe chest injuries but he died prior to arrival. Tunstall, 47, is in hospital with "significant back and abdominal injuries" while five riders suffered minor injuries and the other three were not injured.</p>

If they did, it would save the federal government about $600 billion over the next decade. The change could hit some Republican-led states the hardest, a recent analysis shows, because their Medicaid budgets tend to be more reliant on the medical provider tax strategy. The federal government typically spends a larger share in poorer states, which tend to be in the South, and many of the states that stand to lose the most from the policy are governed by Republicans.</p>
