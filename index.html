            <p>Former President Barack Obama has publicly supported Harvard University's decision to reject demands from the Trump administration amid a funding freeze related to alleged inaction on antisemitism. Obama, a Harvard Law School alumnus, stated that Harvard set an example by resisting what he considers an unlawful attempt to stifle academic freedom, urging other institutions to follow suit. Trump responded by suggesting Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status, accusing the university of pushing political and ideological agendas. The White House insists Harvard must adhere to federal law and apologize for antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Consumer Watchdog has filed a lawsuit against Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, challenging potential surcharges on home insurance policies due to losses suffered by the California Fair Plan. The lawsuit alleges that Lara violated state law by allowing insurance companies to charge policyholders for Fair Plan losses. The Fair Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, has experienced rapid growth as insurers withdraw from fire-prone areas. The lawsuit seeks to prevent surcharges on consumers, arguing they constitute an industry bailout.</p>
