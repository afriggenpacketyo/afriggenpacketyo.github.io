        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation remains above target levels, certain sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing deflation, with prices falling for airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors and supply-and-demand dynamics, but caution that these lower prices may not persist due to market volatility and potential tariffs. Consumers are advised to take advantage of current price drops, as economists predict these prices are not here to stay for very long, likely reversing within weeks or months.

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released after being detained during a citizenship interview, has spoken out against President Trump's administration, asserting that they "will not silence me." Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained under a rarely used law allowing visa revocations for individuals deemed to pose "adverse foreign policy consequences." He maintains his innocence and argues his detention is a betrayal of constitutional principles, emphasizing his advocacy for justice and peace. Mahdawi plans to continue protesting, undeterred by his recent experience, and has denied allegations of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, leader of Germany's conservative party, unexpectedly fell short of a majority in the initial parliament vote for chancellor, despite his coalition holding sufficient seats. This unprecedented failure in modern German political history raises questions about the stability of the new government and has been seized upon by the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which is calling for fresh elections. A second vote has been scheduled, and while Merz's colleagues express confidence in his eventual election, the setback undermines his position and hopes of providing a strong, unified government. The article describes the political fallout and the reactions from various parties.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's repeated suggestions about serving a third term should not be dismissed as jokes, emphasizing the need for forceful pushback from the political system. The editorial highlights Trump's history of testing constitutional limits and his demonstrated disdain for checks on presidential power. It asserts that the 22nd Amendment clearly bars Trump from seeking a third term, countering any potential loopholes or evasions. The board urges Republican leaders to assert the clarity of the law and defend the Constitution against any attempts to undermine it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies refutes President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was used to justify deporting Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang's operations, there is no evidence of direct cooperation or control by the Maduro regime. This revelation undermines the Trump administration's rationale for invoking the deportation law and raises questions about the accuracy of information used to justify the policy.

          <p>Despite growing pressure from within the Labour party following recent local election losses, the UK government insists it will not reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, citing the need to ensure economic stability. The decision to restrict eligibility for the annual payments to only the poorest pensioners has sparked criticism, with some Labour MPs believing a policy reversal would demonstrate the government's understanding of public concerns. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged voter dissatisfaction but defended the move as part of a broader package of changes aimed at raising investment in public services. The article also discusses former cabinet minister Louise Haigh's criticism and the historical context of the winter fuel payment.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional and legal requirements for "due process" in the context of President Trump's deportation policies, noting that while all non-citizens on U.S. soil are entitled to due process, the specifics vary widely. The analysis details the types of notice and hearings afforded to immigrants based on their status and circumstances, including asylum seekers and those detained under the Alien Enemies Act. It also discusses the expedited removal program and the limitations on procedural guarantees in civil removal proceedings. The article concludes that due process means some degree of notice and hearing in most cases, with ongoing legal challenges likely to bring further clarification from the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Several consumer companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, are reporting a slowdown in North American sales due to reduced grocery spending by Hispanic consumers. This pullback is attributed to concerns about stricter immigration policies and broader economic anxieties.

This shift is impacting various sectors, including beer and non-alcoholic beverages, prompting companies to prioritize winning back Hispanic consumers in the coming quarters.

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared she will challenge the Labour government in Westminster when its decisions harm Welsh communities, emphasizing her commitment to the people of Wales over party loyalty. She called for a halt to cuts in disability benefits, a reconsideration of winter fuel allowance reductions, and greater benefits for Wales from wind power via the Crown Estate. Morgan also attacked her rivals, including Reform and Plaid Cymru, and stressed the importance of preserving Welsh Labour's achievements, like free prescriptions and high recycling rates. Her comments come a year ahead of the next Senedd election.</p>

          <p>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's foreign policy strategy is facing a crisis, marked by the abrupt end to his US visit and uncertainty surrounding a planned trip to Moscow. Speculation surrounds the purpose of his US visit, with claims that he was denied entry to an event at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. The EU has strongly opposed Vucic's potential visit to Moscow, warning it could jeopardize Serbia's EU membership aspirations. With limited room to maneuver, Vucic's efforts to maintain relationships with both the East and West are becoming increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>A$AP Rocky's appearance at the 2025 Met Gala, where he served as a co-chair, has stirred debate due to his choice of accessory: an umbrella with a revolver handle. This comes less than three months after he was acquitted on felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. While Rocky's outfit was praised for its on-theme design, the gun-themed accessory has been criticized as insensitive given his recent legal history. Social media users have expressed disapproval, calling the choice "diabolical" and "dangerous" given the circumstances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, effectively securing an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers found that removing ballots six months after election day would violate the due process and equal protection rights of affected residents. He ordered the state board of elections to certify Riggs' victory over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, who had sought to remove ballots he claimed were unlawfully cast.

          <p>A slump in U.S. exports, initially driven by reduced imports, has now expanded across most U.S. ports, particularly impacting the agricultural sector with products like soybeans, corn, and beef. Trade data reveals significant declines in exports from major ports, linked to canceled manufacturing orders and shifts in global demand due to U.S. trade policy. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as supply chain disruptions are expected to lead to leaner inventories. The situation is further compounded by declining containership arrivals and reduced cargo volumes, potentially leading to job losses within the supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>
