          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $124,496 while Ether approached its 2021 record, fueled by investor optimism following cooler-than-expected inflation data. These gains were initially sparked by anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. However, both cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn after hotter-than-expected wholesale inflation data was released. Despite the volatility, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin recently due to institutional buying and a friendlier regulatory environment, signaling a shift towards broader market conviction in crypto assets.

The controversy has intensified existing fears among voters about the fairness of the electoral process, raising concerns about the integrity of India's democratic exercise, and the ECI has been urged to act transparently to restore confidence.</p>

          <p>Kodak, a 133-year-old photography company, is facing financial struggles, reporting a net loss and a decrease in gross profit, leading to doubts about its ability to continue operations. Despite these financial woes, there's a resurgence of film photography among Generation Z, driven by a desire for a slower, more tangible experience. Gen Z's interest in film cameras is fueled by a rebellion against the hyperrealism of digital photography and a craving for the retro aesthetic. Kodak has seen increased demand for film, but its financial instability raises concerns about its future despite the growing popularity of analog photography.</p>

          <p>McDonald's and Wendy's have reported a decline in breakfast sales, attributing it to economic uncertainty and pressures on low-income consumers. McDonald's CEO cited tariffs as a potential contributor to the financial stress experienced by this demographic. As consumers cut discretionary spending, breakfast is often the first meal to be skipped, with more people opting for at-home alternatives. Experts say this trend reflects broader economic pressures such as high credit card interest rates and inflation affecting low- and middle-income Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax legislation could complicate Roth conversions, a strategy where pre-tax IRA funds are transferred to a Roth IRA, incurring income taxes on the converted balance. While the new tax cuts make Roth conversions more appealing, higher income from conversions can impact eligibility for certain tax breaks. The temporary tax breaks available from 2025 through 2028 could offer more room for Roth conversions before hitting the next tax bracket. Experts advise considering the multi-year tax impact and potential effects on Medicare premiums when weighing Roth conversions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Australia are ready to move beyond stabilizing relations and aim for more productive economic cooperation, according to Beijing’s ambassador Xiao Qian. Xiao suggested a closer alignment between Australian mining and Chinese manufacturing through joint exploration and technology sharing. He said both countries have highly compatible development strategies and can complement each other's strengths. This marks a positive step in improving trade relations after previous export curbs on Australian goods.</p>

          <p>China is set to deliver its first domestically developed e-beam lithography tool for commercial use, marking a milestone in its chipmaking capabilities. The new machine, named Xizhi, was developed by a quantum technology lab at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. It uses a focused electron beam to "write" chip circuits onto silicon wafers. This development is part of Beijing's efforts to localize advanced chip manufacturing in response to US export restrictions, strengthening its R&D capabilities.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in advanced talks to secure a new six-year deal for exclusive UK live rights for golf's US Open, beating out competition from other broadcasters, including Netflix. The new deal would solidify Sky's position as the primary broadcaster for televised golf in the UK, holding rights for all major men's and women's tournaments. Netflix's interest in the US Open reflects its growing focus on acquiring sports content for its streaming platform, but Sky's established presence in golf broadcasting appears to give them an edge.</p>

          <p>The Taliban takeover of Kabul in August 2021 has exacerbated Pakistan's internal security challenges, emboldening extremist groups like the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Baloch separatists. These groups have intensified their attacks against the Pakistani state, posing a renewed threat to national security. A UN report indicates the TTP has gained logistical and operational support from the Taliban authorities in Kabul. Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan have strained due to the Afghan Taliban's ties with the TTP, leading to forceful measures from Pakistan, including cross-border airstrikes and expulsions of Afghan refugees.</p>

          <p>Four years after seizing power in Afghanistan, the Taliban appear to have solidified their grip, leading some countries to cautiously engage with the de-facto government. Russia has officially recognized the Taliban, while China maintains close economic and political ties. Germany has organized deportation flights to Afghanistan, necessitating communication with the Taliban on a technical level. Despite this engagement, human rights groups report sustained violations in Afghanistan, particularly regarding women's rights, and a significant portion of the population remains dependent on shrinking foreign aid.</p>
