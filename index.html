          <p>Following a dip caused by a weaker-than-expected labor report, the stock market experienced a significant rebound, which CNBC's Jim Cramer attributes to the impressive earnings from major technology companies. He points to the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, as the foundation of the market's resilience, citing their flawless reports, massive user engagement, and strong growth across various divisions. Cramer suggests that the financial strength and diverse revenue streams of these tech giants make them a formidable force, capable of propping up the market even amidst wider economic concerns.

          <p>Following a tragic family murder-suicide involving a legally held firearm, a bereaved woman's campaign has led to tighter gun control laws in the UK. The new regulations, which have now come into force, increase the number of character references required for a shotgun certificate application and mandate more thorough police checks for domestic abuse and dishonesty. The campaigner, Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were killed, expressed hope that these changes will prevent similar tragedies. The government has indicated it plans to strengthen the guidance even further in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Democrats left the state to block a redistricting vote, preventing a legislative quorum. In response, Governor Greg Abbott threatened arrests and removal from office, citing a non-binding attorney general opinion from 2021. However, legal and political experts note that state authorities lack jurisdiction to make arrests outside of Texas. Furthermore, the constitutional grounds for removing lawmakers from office are extremely narrow, making the governor's threats largely unenforceable as long as the Democratic members remain away from the state.</p>

          <p>A Maryland psychiatrist, Dr. Lisa Carchedi, donated a kidney to her older sister, Gina Warsaw, who was suffering from debilitating kidney failure. The successful transplant surgery was performed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic technique at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which speeds up recovery time for the donor. The sisters, who share a close bond, performed the procedure on the anniversary of their father's death, honoring his belief in family. The life-saving gift has given Warsaw a new chance at life and allowed her to return to spending time with her grandchildren.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Texas House has voted to issue civil arrest warrants for the dozens of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a controversial redistricting plan. House Speaker Dustin Burrows signed the warrants, and the governor ordered state troopers to locate and return the absent members to the capitol. While the warrants empower law enforcement to apprehend the legislators, they are only enforceable within Texas, making the move largely symbolic as long as the Democrats remain out of state in places like Illinois.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has saved the state nearly $170 billion by successfully challenging the Trump administration in court over the past six months.

          <p>France and Saudi Arabia are co-chairing a high-level United Nations effort to revitalize momentum for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At a recent conference, a majority of UN members expressed support for an independent Palestinian state, with several Western nations pledging to formally recognize Palestine. Despite opposition from Israel's current government and the ongoing war in Gaza, the initiative aims to build a political framework for peace. Organizers plan to maintain pressure with a follow-up event at the UN General Assembly in September.</p>

Directed by Sergio Trujillo, the production leaned into its concert-style roots, creating a supercharged atmosphere. Erivo's performance, in particular, was described as a modern, timeless, and unforgettable interpretation that brought profound depth to the iconic role.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has confirmed that Democratic lawmakers are preparing a plan to place a mid-decade redistricting measure on the November ballot. However, this measure would be "triggered" only if Texas Republicans successfully proceed with their own plan to redraw congressional maps to their advantage. This strategic move positions California to counteract a potential GOP power grab that could influence control of the U.S. House. The timeline is tight, requiring lawmakers to act quickly upon returning from recess to get the measure approved for the election.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, escalating the legal consequences he faces for an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. The decision, issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated previous court-imposed restrictions, including a ban on using social media. On Sunday, allies broadcast a live call from Bolsonaro at a rally where he repeated claims of election fraud, prompting the court to tighten his restrictions to house arrest and ban him from receiving most visitors.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Korean survivors and their descendants continue to grapple with the physical and emotional aftermath. An estimated 20% of the initial victims were Koreans, many of whom were in Japan as forced laborers under colonial rule. Survivors who returned to Korea faced social stigma, poverty, and a legacy of health problems that they believe have been passed to subsequent generations. They express frustration over a lack of accountability from Japan, the U.S., and their own government, which has been slow to investigate their plight.</p>

China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling over 85% of processing and 90% of permanent magnet production, creating a major vulnerability for the United States and its allies. While the West is making diplomatic efforts to diversify its sources, analysts note a lack of investment and technical expertise is hindering progress, making the resource-rich developing world a new front line in this strategic contest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a process to reverse a Biden-era policy that allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the health of the veteran. A new filing argues the current policy is "legally questionable" and aims to align the VA with federal laws that restrict public funding for abortions. If finalized, the rule would block access to abortion care at VA facilities, even in states where the procedure is banned, a move that reproductive rights advocates say robs veterans of essential healthcare.</p>

The "one-in, one-out" scheme will allow the UK to detain and return some migrants arriving illegally by boat to France. In return, the UK will accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers directly from France, provided they meet specific eligibility and security criteria. Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the plan as a result of "grown-up diplomacy," though critics argue it will not be as effective as previous proposals.</p>
