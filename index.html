          <p>Russia launched a significant aerial attack on Kyiv, utilizing 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles, resulting in at least 14 injuries and fires in residential areas. Ukraine's air force reported downing six missiles and 245 drones during the assault, marking one of the largest combined aerial attacks on the capital since the war began. President Zelensky condemned the attack, asserting it reinforced the global view that Moscow is prolonging the conflict. The attack occurred shortly after Russia and Ukraine engaged in a prisoner swap facilitated by talks in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Ryan Kingerski, a 26-year-old police officer, died by suicide after experiencing severe complications from LASIK eye surgery. His parents attribute his death to debilitating side effects, including severe headaches, double vision, and visual disturbances, though vision experts maintain the procedure is generally safe. The parents are now advocating for greater transparency and accountability within the LASIK industry, filing a complaint with the FDA and connecting with other families who have had similar experiences. The article notes previous suicides linked to laser eye surgery complications, while industry representatives defend the procedure's overall safety and effectiveness.</p>

Experts testified that Khalil's activism and criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza could put him at risk of harm or arrest if deported.

          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is amending the "Building Energy Act," aiming to reverse key climate protection measures implemented by the previous Green Party administration. Reiche intends to abolish the operating ban on older gas boilers, prioritizing energy supply security alongside climate protection. Critics argue that these plans could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies, while the government emphasizes the need for new gas-fired power plants. Despite these shifts, a significant investment program for infrastructure includes substantial funding for climate protection, highlighting ongoing tensions between economic and environmental priorities.</p>

          <p>Royal Mail is under investigation by Ofcom after failing to meet delivery targets, with almost a quarter of first-class post arriving late. The company missed its target for second-class post as well, prompting concerns from regulators and consumer advocates. Royal Mail attributes the issues to ongoing modernization efforts and the need for reform of its universal service obligation (USO), which requires deliveries six days a week. Citizens Advice has criticized the company for hiking stamp prices while failing to deliver on time, calling for greater regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's victory in the Romanian presidential election was significantly influenced by record numbers of ethnic Hungarian and Moldovan voters. Conservative estimates suggest that these groups contributed between 500,000 and 700,000 votes to Dan's lead, securing the pro-European candidate's win against a hard-right opponent. The Hungarian minority defied Viktor Orban's endorsement of the hard-right candidate, while Moldovans favored Dan due to his pro-EU stance and his opponent's unpopular views on reunification. This outcome highlights the crucial role of minority groups in safeguarding democracy and Romania's Euro-Atlantic trajectory.</p>

The prince argued that the state should consider his birthright and the associated risks, but the courts ruled he misunderstood how the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) operates. Ravec's role is to assess security for senior royals, and Harry's decision to step back from royal duties and live abroad altered the framework for his protection. The article explores the origins of Ravec, its response to Harry's decision, and the legal arguments presented.</p>

The dispute centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with the union blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress. The council insists that clearing waste is a public health duty, while the union argues that its members cannot afford the proposed pay cuts.</p>

          <p>Women with pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are often scared to come off the contraceptive pill, which is the primary treatment, to get pregnant, due to the potential return of severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts. PMDD affects up to 8% of women and causes intense emotional and physical symptoms before menstruation, with an average diagnosis wait time of 12 years. While antidepressants are an alternative, doctors often advise discontinuing them during pregnancy, creating a difficult choice for women. The Welsh government is working to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

          <p>Many young people in China are putting retirement plans on hold due to rising job uncertainty, stagnant wages, and housing pressures amid a slowing economy. The government's call for early retirement planning feels out of touch with their current realities. Most young employees are too preoccupied with immediate concerns to prioritize retirement, viewing it as too distant and uncertain. The government has been urging young people to start saving early for retirement to address the country's aging population and strained pension system.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza after a prolonged blockade, aid agencies warn that it is insufficient and famine looms.

UNRWA, WFP, and other organizations are involved in distributing aid, but face obstructions from bombs, looting, and destroyed roads. The maritime aid corridor has also been unreliable, and if the influx remains at current levels, Gaza's population is at risk of famine in the coming weeks.</p>

A study found that 45% of workers aged 20 to 59 are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with those in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. The primary motivation is to have more "me time" and avoid the sacrifices their parents made for their companies.

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the search for New Orleans jail escapees has sparked scrutiny over privacy and civil rights concerns. While authorities credit the technology with aiding in the recapture of one fugitive, critics argue that it poses a threat to fundamental rights and raises questions about accountability. The ACLU and some members of Congress have voiced opposition to the use of live facial recognition, citing potential for racial bias and surveillance.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. Federal air traffic controllers didn't have a good fix on the helicopter's location due to conflicting data. The Army attributed the lost contact to a temporary antenna and stated there was no risk of intersecting air traffic. The incident added to unease about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.</p>
