        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed that veterinary practices be required to publish their price lists to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation found that vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, with large corporate groups charging significantly more than independent vets. The proposed changes, which also include capping prescription fees and banning certain bonuses, aim to help owners shop around and avoid unexpectedly large bills for animal treatments. The current regulatory system, established in 1966, is seen as outdated for the modern corporate-dominated industry.</p>

          <p>Raila Odinga, a central and polarizing figure in Kenyan politics for decades, has passed away at the age of 80 while receiving medical treatment in India. Odinga, who served as Prime Minister in a power-sharing government, ran for president five times unsuccessfully, often challenging the results and alleging fraud. Remembered for his role in fighting for democratic freedoms and as Kenya's longest-serving political detainee, his career was marked by both fierce opposition and eventual reconciliation with political rivals for the sake of national unity. His death marks the end of an era in the nation's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Missouri has carried out its first execution of the year, putting to death Lance Shockley, 48, for the 2005 murder of State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. Shockley was convicted of ambushing and shooting the trooper near his home, a crime prosecutors argued was motivated by a desire to stop Graham's investigation into him for a separate incident. Despite maintaining his innocence and his lawyers arguing the case was circumstantial, all of Shockley's appeals and a clemency request were denied. The execution proceeded by lethal injection at the state prison in Bonne Terre.</p>

However, the company also warned of a significant decline in sales to China next year due to geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions. Despite this, ASML reported strong third-quarter orders of 5.4 billion euros, buoyed by the global demand for AI technology. The company maintained its forecast for a 15% sales increase for the current year compared to the last. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region posted gains on Wednesday, in contrast to declines on Wall Street, even as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated. U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China and threatened new trade actions, contributing to volatility in American markets. Despite this, Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index all saw significant rises. The positive performance in Asia occurred alongside the release of Chinese data showing consumer prices fell more than expected, indicating persistent deflationary pressures in the country's economy.

The company is also relaxing other restrictions to make the AI more "human-like" and creative, a move that follows earlier efforts to tighten safeguards around sensitive topics like mental health.

The advisers urged the government to establish a clear framework with long-term objectives and hold departments accountable for meeting adaptation goals.

          <p>A massive fire at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people, with officials concerned the death toll may increase. The blaze, which took hours to extinguish, spread to an adjacent chemical warehouse that reportedly lacked proper safety clearances and stored flammable materials. Authorities believe most victims died from inhaling toxic gas, as a roof exit was found to be locked, trapping them inside. Such incidents are tragically common in Bangladesh, often attributed to lax safety standards and inadequate infrastructure in the country's industrial sector.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent Gaza ceasefire credits U.S. President Donald Trump's decisive push for securing the agreement, but questions its long-term viability as a foundation for peace. The deal, which facilitated a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, is framed as a temporary cessation of hostilities rather than the beginning of a genuine peace process. The article highlights significant remaining obstacles, including the disarmament of Hamas and the establishment of a stable governance structure for Gaza. With the ceasefire already showing signs of fragility, sustained diplomatic effort is needed to address the core issues of the conflict.</p>

The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, with home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Max Muncy. The win gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead in the series as it shifts to Los Angeles.</p>

          <h2>Legal Challenge Questions 'Acting' Status of Trump-Appointed U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>A federal judge is considering a legal challenge to the appointment of Bill Essayli as the acting U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles. Defense attorneys argue that the Trump administration used an improper legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate confirmation, and are seeking to have indictments dismissed. The government maintains that his appointment is valid, and if not, his concurrent designation as first assistant U.S. attorney allows him to continue supervising the office. The case is one of several similar challenges to Trump-appointed prosecutors across the country, raising constitutional questions about temporary appointments.</p>

          <p>Fesia Davenport, the chief executive officer of Los Angeles County, received a $2 million settlement from the county this summer. The payment addresses what she described as reputational harm and emotional distress caused by Measure G, a voter-approved initiative that will make her appointed position an elected one by 2028, effectively ending her tenure. In a letter to county counsel, Davenport argued the measure had an unprecedented and damaging impact on her career, health, and future economic outlook. Under the settlement terms, Davenport, who is currently on medical leave, cannot sue the county over the ballot measure's enactment.</p>

          <p>According to some Chinese economic researchers, escalating trade pressure from the United States could inadvertently bolster unity and motivation within China. Amid new sanctions and tariffs, scholars like Yang Jianwen of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences argue that external pressure often transforms into a driving force for the nation. This perspective suggests that rather than yielding, Beijing may double down on its long-term economic strategies. The heightened tensions come as the Communist Party prepares for its fourth plenum, where this theme of resilience in the face of external challenges is expected to be prominent.</p>

          <p>Despite a largely positive story about his role in the Gaza ceasefire, Donald Trump has publicly criticized the cover photo used by Time magazine for its November 10 issue. On his Truth Social platform, Trump called the picture "super bad," complaining that the low-angle shot made his hair "disappear" and created a strange halo effect. The former president has a long-documented fascination with appearing on the cover of Time. The photo, which some commentators noted was unflattering to his chin and neck, has generated discussion about the publication's artistic choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a television advertisement from Red Tractor, the country's largest farm certification scheme, for making misleading environmental claims. The ruling found that the organization provided insufficient evidence to support the ad's suggestion that its certified farms ensure a high level of environmental protection. The complaint, brought by the group River Action, cited an Environment Agency report indicating Red Tractor farms were not necessarily indicators of good environmental performance. Red Tractor called the ASA's decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is on food safety and animal welfare, not environmental standards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced the seizure of approximately $15 billion in bitcoin connected to a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia. The seizure, the largest in DOJ history, is tied to an indictment against Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of the scheme who remains at large. Prosecutors allege Zhi's Prince Holding Group operated forced-labor scam compounds where trafficked individuals were made to defraud victims worldwide out of billions of dollars through cryptocurrency investment scams. The Treasury Department also designated the Prince Group as a transnational criminal organization and sanctioned Zhi and his associates.</p>
