          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has emphasized the need for the organization to strengthen its partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region in response to China's growing military capabilities and its alignment with Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Rutte highlighted China's substantial military buildup, noting that the country already possesses the world's largest navy, projected to reach 435 ships by 2030, and aims to have over 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by the same year. Rutte's remarks coincided with U.S.-China ministerial-level trade negotiations, underscoring the strategic importance of addressing China's military challenge through enhanced international cooperation. The PLA navy currently has 234 warships compared to the US Navy's 219 and the Pentagon has stated that China has over 200 times the shipbuilding capacity of the US.</p>

          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles, the National Guard and Marines have been deployed with specific rules of force, prioritizing the protection of federal buildings and personnel without engaging directly with protesters or patrolling streets. According to U.S. officials, troops are carrying weapons but without ammunition loaded, using it only for self-defense, and they are prohibited from using rubber bullets or pepper spray. These rules would change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, and the personnel are led by Army Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman with de-escalation as the top priority. The deployed force, known as "Task Force 51," consists of 2,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 active-duty Marines trained in de-escalation and crowd control. The troops' deployment is intended to ensure continuous coverage of the area due to protests against immigration sweeps.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has activated approximately 700 active-duty Marines for potential deployment to Los Angeles to join National Guard troops responding to protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. These Marines, based in Twentynine Palms, are expected to integrate with the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, having received training in de-escalation, crowd control, and rules for the use of force. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office stated that it believes the Marines are merely being moved from one base to another, and Newsom has opposed the deployment, leading the state of California to sue the Trump administration over the federalization of the National Guard, arguing that it aggravates an already tense situation.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), asserting that the committee has become a rubber stamp for any vaccine. Kennedy stated that a clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science, and the move comes a week after a committee leader resigned following an order from Kennedy to change COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections. The move has been met with disappointment from outside medical groups, as it bypassed the longstanding advisory committee process and usurped an already-ongoing work group within the panel.</p>

The hearing stems from a lawsuit filed by the Edgar County Watchdogs Inc., after Henyard and the Village of Dolton failed to produce financial records requested under the Freedom of Information Act.

          <p>President Trump has raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to quell protests in Los Angeles, prompting legal questions about the extent of his authority to curb these demonstrations. The Insurrection Act, a 218-year-old law, allows the president to use federal troops in states under certain conditions, such as rebellion or when federal laws cannot be enforced through regular judicial proceedings. However, legal experts have cautioned that the law is broad and vague, and there have been calls for reform to provide greater checks on presidential power. Trump has already deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows the president to call on federal service members when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion, but Gov. Newsom is suing the administration over this deployment.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender athletes from competing in sports, arguing the federal agency has overstepped its authority in violation of state and federal law. The lawsuit is a response to a letter from the Justice Department warning school districts of potential legal liability if they do not ban transgender athletes, arguing that allowing them to compete would deprive girls of athletic opportunities based solely on their biological sex. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the state's antidiscrimination laws protect transgender athletes and that excluding them constitutes illegal discrimination. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the constitutionality of California's laws and prevent the Trump administration from taking retaliatory actions against school districts that refuse to comply with the federal directive.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that it would be "great" to arrest California Governor Gavin Newsom, escalating tensions amid protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles. Trump has criticized Newsom's handling of the protests, characterizing them as "violent, insurrectionist mobs" and deploying National Guard members to the city. In response, Newsom has accused the White House of exacerbating the situation for political gain and has initiated a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming the federalization of the National Guard is illegal. The situation has intensified the long-standing political divide between Trump and Newsom, with both sides accusing the other of exploiting the situation for their own purposes.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has closed the door on the Ange Postecoglou era and is bidding to replace him with Thomas Frank, who established Brentford in the Premier League after winning promotion from the Championship in 2021. Frank, 51, is the second-longest-serving current manager in English football's top-flight behind Manchester City's Pep Guardiola. Frank has been described as the opposite of Postecoglou for his adaptability, and would be Tottenham's fourth permanent manager since 30 June 2021. There is much more pressure at Tottenham than there is at Brentford, because of the expectation - and the manager has to handle that expectation.</p>

          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, leaders of the "Orgasmic Meditation" group OneTaste, have been convicted of forced labor conspiracy charges. The charges stem from allegations that they coerced employees into performing sexual acts under the guise of empowerment and wellness. Prosecutors argued that the defendants sought complete control over their employees' lives, driving them into debt and withholding wages while directing them to perform sexual acts. The case has drawn attention to the practices of OneTaste, which promoted orgasmic meditation as a means of female empowerment and sexual healing.</p>

The letter, called the Bethesda Declaration, calls on Bhattacharya to reverse grants that have been delayed or terminated for political reasons and to allow work with foreign collaborators. The signatories also asked Bhattacharya to reverse a policy capping indirect costs for research at 15% and to reinstate essential staff who were fired at NIH.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops by President Trump. The protests began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers carried out raids in areas with prominent Latino populations. Demonstrations, initially peaceful, escalated with vehicles set on fire, a major freeway shut down, and reports of looting in affected areas. The National Guard deployment, triggered by Trump's assertion that the protests constituted a rebellion against the government, has sparked a political row with state politicians.</p>

This trend reflects the challenges of entering the property market due to near-record-high home prices, low inventory, and elevated mortgage rates. Americans who are shut out from buying their first homes miss out on an opportunity to build wealth through homeownership.

The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion and had not proved defamation.
