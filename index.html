            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to escalate tariffs, pledging to take countermeasures to protect its interests. This response follows Trump's proposal to impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing doesn't withdraw its retaliatory tariffs. China views this as a mistake and asserts that it will defend its rights, signaling a potential escalation of the trade war between the two nations. The tariffs could significantly impact China's economy, potentially reducing its growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points.</p>

European countries are more inclined to purchase from European or allied firms like South Korea, prioritizing strategic alignment. This shift is boosting sales for companies like Rheinmetall and Korea Aerospace Industries, as countries seek to bolster their defense autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>According to retired PLA Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, China's rise in global influence is unstoppable, particularly as the U.S. becomes less interested in policing the world. Zhou argues that while the Taiwan issue remains a potential conflict flashpoint, China's military buildup, especially its navy, is driven by the need to protect overseas interests and fulfill international responsibilities. He suggests that the U.S.'s focus on pressuring allies provides China with an opportunity to strengthen its position in the international order.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to use the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime powers law, for deportations, but mandates that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. The ruling comes amidst allegations that the migrants were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. While the administration claims this as a win, the justices require that deportees be given notice and an opportunity to seek habeas relief. The ACLU also claimed the ruling as a victory because of the due process granted to those being removed.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday. The meeting, described as being at 'almost the highest level,' aims to find a diplomatic solution to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Trump warned that if the talks are unsuccessful, it would be a 'very bad day for Iran.' The announcement comes as Netanyahu visits the White House and Trump reiterates his vision of a post-war exodus of Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, but with certain limits, emphasizing judicial review. The court sided with the administration's request to lift a Washington DC-based judge’s order temporarily blocking the deportations, but did not immediately address whether the administration improperly utilized the act. The ruling requires any challenges to the wartime law to take place in Texas, where the migrants were held. The decision allows the Trump administration to resume deportations.</p>
