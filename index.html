        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can restrict journalists' access to certain areas of the White House based on their viewpoints. The 2-1 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit overturned a lower court's ruling that had required the White House to provide the Associated Press with full access. The judges in the majority argued that the restricted presidential spaces are not First Amendment forums, allowing the White House discretion over journalist admissions, while the dissenting judge warned of lasting damage to press freedom and the potential for viewpoint-based exclusion. This decision has implications for press coverage and the administration's control over its message.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland to El Salvador, has been brought back to the United States to face criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia on two counts related to a years-long conspiracy to transport thousands of migrants from Texas. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked the Salvadoran President for his cooperation in returning Abrego Garcia, who will be deported again if convicted. The decision to pursue the indictment led to the resignation of a federal prosecutor who believed the case was politically motivated, and Abrego Garcia's attorney asserts the government is playing games with his life and due process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene and lift an injunction blocking dramatic staffing cuts at the U.S. Department of Education. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the cuts are a streamlining effort within the Executive's purview, not an attempt to eliminate the department, citing a $66.7 billion funding request for fiscal year 2026 as evidence. A lower court had previously blocked the cuts, stating they would make it impossible for the department to carry out its statutory functions. The case consolidates two separate lawsuits brought in response to the administration's plans to shrink the Education Department.</p>

DocuSign now expects billings of $3.28 billion to $3.34 billion for the current fiscal year, a decrease from the previous range. The lowered outlook has negatively impacted investor confidence, despite the company's otherwise positive financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>
