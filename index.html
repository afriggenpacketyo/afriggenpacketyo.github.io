The deceased include two men and two women, with injured victims ranging from 21 to 32 years old, some in critical condition. This tragic event occurred on the same block as a previous mass shooting in 2022 when the venue operated as Hush Lounge, highlighting persistent violence in the area.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives advanced President Donald Trump's comprehensive spending bill early Thursday, following overnight maneuvering and concessions from Republican holdouts. This 'big, beautiful' bill aims to extend Trump-era tax cuts while significantly slashing the social safety net and altering renewable energy tax credits. Democrats are unified in opposition, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and could strip health insurance from millions. The Congressional Budget Office warns the bill could add trillions to the national debt, though the White House disputes these estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Representative Eugene Vindman expressed his fury over the Pentagon's decision to freeze critical U.S. weapons shipments, including Patriot missiles and artillery, to Ukraine. This halt was reportedly driven by Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby after a review revealed dangerously low U.S. munitions stockpiles, deemed insufficient for contingency plans. The White House defended the move as prioritizing America's interests, but Vindman argued it puts Ukrainian lives and territory at risk in their fight against Russian aggression. Replenishing these vital stockpiles is expected to take considerable time.</p>

Major carriers like Southwest and Delta pulled their 2025 forecasts, citing economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariffs and fewer overseas visitors.

Jeffries criticized Republicans for limiting debate and rubber-stamping a bill he views as dangerous to the American people's well-being.

However, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's strong public backing of Reeves, stating they work 'in lockstep,' appeared to placate investors. Analysts noted that financial markets seem to support the Chancellor, viewing her as crucial for maintaining fiscal stability, which also impacts mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The solid job growth, coupled with moderate wage increases, indicates a resilient labor market, which is likely to deter the Federal Reserve from implementing a July interest rate cut.

A judge ruled that Trump's pardon did not apply to these new charges, as Kelley also developed a 'kill list' of law enforcement officers.

This trend allows the president to implement policies quickly, often bypassing standard judicial review processes.

While support for gay marriage grew significantly after the first legal same-sex marriage in 2004, this new data indicates a complex and evolving social landscape.

          <p>Dr. Marwan Sultan, the director of Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, was killed along with several family members in an Israeli airstrike on his home in Gaza City. The Hamas-run health ministry condemned the attack, highlighting Dr. Sultan's long career and dedication as a medical professional. The Israeli military stated it struck a 'key terrorist' and is reviewing claims of harm to uninvolved civilians, asserting Hamas's use of civilian infrastructure. This incident underscores the severe impact of ongoing conflict on medical personnel and infrastructure, with no functioning hospitals remaining in north Gaza.</p>

While Tinubu's allies dismiss the ADC as 'retired politicians without electoral value,' observers note that past coalitions have successfully unseated incumbents.

          <p>Apple's iPhone sales in mainland China are projected to encounter significant challenges in the latter half of 2025, despite a recent boost from promotions during the midyear shopping festival.

Furthermore, aggressive efforts by domestic rivals, particularly Huawei Technologies, to target the high-end smartphone segment are expected to further impact Apple's market performance.

This loss is significant because MethaneSat was meant to provide publicly available, highly sensitive data on methane sources, a potent greenhouse gas responsible for nearly a third of human-induced warming.

Car giant Stellantis, Citroen's parent company, has instructed owners to cease using these models until repairs are completed, but many face long waits and poor communication.
