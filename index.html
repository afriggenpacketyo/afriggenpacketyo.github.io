          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority in implementing reciprocal tariffs, a significant setback to his economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump invoked, does not grant the president the power to impose such broad duties. The lawsuit was brought by U.S. businesses reliant on imports, and the judges ordered the tariffs to be vacated and permanently stopped. The White House is expected to appeal, but the decision puts Trump's economic policies under pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

The DHS defended its action, citing Garcia's alleged involvement in human trafficking and abuse, while Democrats claim he was denied due process.

          <p>A U.S. federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies. The Court of International Trade stated that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether California is violating the civil rights of cisgender girls by allowing transgender students to compete in school sports. The Justice Department is also supporting a lawsuit alleging similar violations in the Riverside Unified School District. These actions follow scrutiny of transgender track athletes in Jurupa Valley and Riverside, with anti-LGBTQ+ activists targeting them. The investigation will consider whether California's laws and policies violate Title IX.</p>

          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) will invest over Â£1 billion to develop battlefield technology aimed at speeding up decision-making. A new Digital Targeting Web will connect soldiers with information from satellites, aircraft, and drones to target enemy threats faster. The technology will harness Artificial Intelligence (AI) and software, reflecting lessons learned from the war in Ukraine. The UK's military cyber operations will be overseen by a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command, and the extra investment is possible due to increased defense spending.</p>
