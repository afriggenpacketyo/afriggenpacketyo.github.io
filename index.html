          <p>A missile launched from Yemen struck central Israel near Tel Aviv's international airport, causing a temporary suspension of flights on Sunday. While there were no fatalities reported, two people sustained injuries from the blast, and another was hurt while seeking shelter. The Israeli military stated that interception attempts were made, and an impact was confirmed near Ben-Gurion Airport, prompting an ongoing review of the incident. The Iranian-backed Houthi militia claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred after Israel ended a cease-fire in its conflict in Gaza, with most missiles being intercepted but fragments still falling across Israel.</p>

          <p>An episode of '48 Hours' investigates the suspicious death of Kendy Howard, who was found in her bathtub with a gunshot wound to the head, initially reported as a suicide by her husband, Dan Howard. First responders noted several unusual details at the scene, including broken glass, wet towels, a packed duffle bag, and the fact that the water in the tub was still warm. Most notably, an unfinished dryer cycle with only six minutes remaining caught the attention of investigators, leading them to believe that Dan Howard started the laundry just before calling 911, raising questions about his actions and motives surrounding his wife's death.</p>

          <p>Japan has accused China of violating its airspace near the disputed Senkaku Islands, controlled by Japan but claimed by China, leading to a strong protest from Tokyo. According to Japan's Foreign Ministry, a Chinese helicopter flew within Japanese airspace for approximately 15 minutes, prompting a response from Japanese fighter jets. Simultaneously, China alleges that a Japanese civilian aircraft illegally entered its airspace near the islands, resulting in China's coast guard using a helicopter to 'expel' the aircraft.

          <p>With US-Iran nuclear negotiations postponed, Iran's opposition is cautiously optimistic about potential diplomatic breakthroughs, though divided on the best path to remove the current regime. Human rights activist Iraj Mesdaghi believes neither a 2015-like agreement nor military strikes on nuclear sites would benefit the Iranian people. Hamed Sheibani Rad of the New Iran Party supports foreign intervention alongside Iranian resistance, while historian Arash Azizi emphasizes internal change. Azizi views a diplomatic resolution as beneficial, potentially easing sanctions and creating more freedom for pro-democracy efforts, while downplaying the influence of diaspora Iranians.</p>

She challenges the notion that mothers who occasionally use pouches are lazy or neglectful, emphasizing the importance of balancing time, labor, and sanity in parenting.

          <p>Nigel Farage's goal of becoming prime minister is gaining credibility after Reform's recent electoral successes, challenging the traditional two-party system in the UK. Reform's wins in local elections and ahead-of-the-curve poll numbers are prompting both Labour and the Conservatives to re-evaluate their strategies. While Labour must prove its ability to govern effectively, the Tories face the challenge of regaining voter trust and defining a clear path forward. The success of Reform UK highlights public disillusionment with the political system, raising questions about the future of British politics.</p>
