        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and Chinese delegations concluded their first day of sensitive tariff negotiations in Switzerland, with plans to resume discussions the following day. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in over 10 hours of meetings aimed at de-escalating trade tensions that have destabilized global markets. While no immediate progress was reported, both sides acknowledged the need for de-escalation, given the unsustainable nature of the high tariffs, with President Trump hinting at potential tariff reductions contingent on a fair deal. The talks are taking place at the Villa Saladin in Geneva, with hopes of scaling back tariffs to relieve financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after being convicted of defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth befriended the 66-year-old victim while preparing her taxes and offered her fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high returns with no risk. The scheme, which ran from 2013 to 2019, involved Cohen-Roth using the victim's funds and money from other 'investors' in a Ponzi scheme to pay off earlier investors and fund a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute, while Cohen-Roth lived comfortably on the stolen money, leading to a sentence that acknowledges the severity of the crime despite the defendant's age.</p>

          <p>After days of escalated conflict involving missile, drone, and artillery strikes, India and Pakistan announced a cease-fire agreement, though reports of cross-border firing continued. President Trump initially claimed the U.S. mediated the cease-fire, a claim India disputed. The conflict, which began after a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, saw both sides targeting each otherâ€™s military bases, resulting in heavy damage. Despite the cease-fire announcement, accusations of truce violations persisted, with both countries blaming each other for initiating further violence, as several countries urged restraint and de-escalation amid fears of a full-blown war.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders began rookie minicamp, with Gabriel receiving the first snaps, but head coach Kevin Stefanski cautioned against reading too much into the order. Stefanski emphasized that the team has a plan for evaluating all five quarterbacks on the roster and that the evaluation process is comprehensive, extending beyond practice reps. The Browns' quarterback situation is uncertain due to Deshaun Watson's Achilles injury, leaving the Week 1 starter position open among Watson, Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, Gabriel, and Sanders.</p>

Starmer emphasized the unprecedented unity among allies and the potential for material progress, while the Kremlin accused European leaders of confrontational rhetoric and insisted on a halt to Western military aid to Ukraine before any ceasefire can occur.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying for President Trump's tax agenda, with key issues emerging as policy experts weigh in on potential impacts. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but significant changes are anticipated before the final vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation, requiring adherence to a limited budget framework. Experts note that the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for a more fiscally responsible package could pose challenges to the bill's passage and specific provisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are facing obstacles due to concerns about conflicts of interest arising from his personal cryptocurrency ventures. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, citing the potential for individuals to enrich the president by buying cryptocurrencies he owns or controls. The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, have raised ethical questions, leading Democrats to introduce the "End Crypto Corruption Act." Some industry figures worry that these conflicts could hinder advancements and damage the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing potential criticism for being "Too Late" in responding to economic conditions, as President Trump pressures the central bank to cut rates despite uncertain impacts from tariffs. Economists suggest Powell is in a difficult position, with threats to both sides of the Fed's mandate of full employment and low inflation. While Trump insists inflation is under control, recent data show mixed signals, with concerns arising from surveys in manufacturing, service sectors, and consumer sentiment. Powell has dismissed the idea of pre-emptive rate cuts, citing a "solid" economy and labor market, but some analysts fear the Fed may be behind the curve.</p>
