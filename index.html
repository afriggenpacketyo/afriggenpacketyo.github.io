            <p>President Trump's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods is expected to create significant challenges for Cambodian factories and workers, who are already at the lower end of the global income distribution.

Manufacturers are instead considering relocating their supply chains to other countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia.

            <p>American consumers are bracing for potential price increases on Chinese goods as President Trump's tariffs take effect. The reliance on Chinese manufacturing, particularly in electronics, makes it difficult to quickly find alternative sources at comparable costs. For example, iPhones, primarily assembled in China, are likely candidates for price hikes. Despite efforts to diversify supply chains, many industries remain heavily dependent on Chinese production, leading to consumer concerns about the impact of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Workers in China's “Shein village,” a hub for small clothing manufacturers, are anxious about the potential impact of escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The workers, who earn wages tied to their output, face the risk of job losses and reduced working hours due to higher tariffs. Some factory owners are exploring relocation options to countries like Vietnam, adding to the uncertainty. The escalating trade war is creating significant challenges for garment producers selling on cross-border e-commerce platforms like Shein.</p>

            <p>Mass firings at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have led to chaos and confusion within agencies like the CDC, FDA, and NIH. Thousands of federal workers lost their jobs, impacting critical areas such as violence prevention, antibiotic resistance testing, and product recalls. The firings, reportedly overseen by members of a “department of government efficiency,” have disrupted research and left remaining staff scrambling to assess the damage. Critics warn that the cuts will endanger public health and undermine the nation's research infrastructure.</p>

The tools share key features with Quina technology, previously associated with Neanderthals in Europe and the Middle East. This discovery challenges the previous belief that early hominids in China showed slow technological development. The findings could reshape our understanding of human evolution and the distribution of Neanderthals across Eurasia.</p>

            <p>Some lenders are expected to reduce mortgage rates following market turbulence caused by President Trump's tariff policies, which have increased expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. TSB Bank and MPowered Mortgages have already trimmed rates, signaling a potential downward trend in mortgage costs. Financial markets and economists anticipate more aggressive rate cuts by the Bank of England to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs.

            <p>President Trump has defended his sweeping tariffs, urging Americans to trust his policies and dismissing opponents as "PANICANS." The term, likely a combination of "panic" and "Americans" or "Republicans," refers to those who criticize his trade policies. Despite support from some allies, Trump faces growing dissent from business figures, conservative commentators, and Republican members of Congress who warn of the potential economic consequences of the tariffs. The tariffs are designed to target almost all of the world's countries, with the goal of boosting the U.S. economy and protecting jobs.</p>
