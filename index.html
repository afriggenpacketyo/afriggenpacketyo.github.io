          <p>A Russian drone attack struck a civilian shuttle bus in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people. The deadly strike occurred shortly after Ukrainian and Russian officials met for the first time in over three years to discuss prisoner exchanges, where they agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each. Ukraine’s foreign minister condemned the attack as a deliberate war crime, while local residents reported increased bombardments in the area, particularly near the Russian border. The article specifies that the drone used was a Lancet, guided by a surveillance drone, highlighting the precision and devastating impact of Russian weaponry on civilian targets in the ongoing conflict. The constant threat of aerial attacks has caused significant destruction and displacement in the region.</p>

          <p>Newly released audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about being a "young man" despite struggling with key memories. The interview, conducted in October 2023, focused on Biden's handling of classified documents, and the audio recordings highlight instances where Biden slurred his words and appeared to have memory lapses. Hur's report declined to press charges against Biden, characterizing him as a sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory, a conclusion that drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Ultimately, Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, and his vice president Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in November's general election.</p>

          <p>Beth Potter, an Olympic triathlon bronze medalist, achieved second place in the World Triathlon Championship Series held in Yokohama, Japan, finishing just four seconds behind Luxembourg's Jeanne Lehair.

Although Lehair secured the victory, Potter recorded the fastest run leg in the race, marking a strong return to form after competing in the European Road Running Championships last month.

          <p>Three Iranian men, Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, have been charged under the UK's National Security Act for allegedly assisting Iran. The charges relate to activities between August 2024 and February 2025, and all three men have been remanded in custody. Police say the charges are extremely serious and follow a complex and fast-moving investigation, with one of the men also charged with intending to commit serious violence in the UK. The arrests were made under Section 27 of the National Security Act, granting police the power to arrest individuals suspected of foreign power threat activity without a warrant.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the growing disparity between the rich and the average person, arguing that the term "rich list" inadequately describes the extent of extreme wealth. The gap between the wealthiest and average individuals has tripled since 1989, leading to concerns about the power the super-rich wield in shaping politics and harming the environment. The author proposes establishing an "extreme wealth line" to curb excessive wealth accumulation, suggesting measures like higher taxes or mandatory charitable donations for those exceeding this line. The article calls for a democratic way of defining when wealth becomes harmful to address inequality effectively.</p>

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt emphasized the government's commitment to stopping illegal immigration and people smuggling, increasing border police presence and using advanced surveillance technology. This policy marks a departure from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum approach and aims to address concerns raised by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). However, the new measures have faced criticism from neighboring countries, particularly Poland, which prefers combating illegal immigration at the EU's external borders.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing how early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to different environments. Researchers found that the closest living relatives of Indigenous North Americans are west Beringian groups, such as the Inuit, Koryaks, and Luoravetlans. The study also highlighted distinct genetic traits in various Indigenous groups, which may have evolved through adaptation to extreme environments.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through the Midwest, resulting in at least seven deaths and widespread damage in Missouri. The storms caused building collapses, power outages, and traffic gridlock, with St. Louis declaring a state of emergency and implementing a curfew. Weather forecasters warned of possible tornadoes, hail, and hurricane-force winds in parts of Appalachia and the Midwest. Meanwhile, Texas faced a heat wave, and storms in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan left thousands without power.</p>

Paused tariffs include "reciprocal" tariffs and higher tariffs on Chinese goods, while exemptions cover goods from Canada and Mexico in the USMCA, as well as smartphones, computers, and other electronics imported from China.
