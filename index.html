          <p>A Chinese student at Harvard, Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, delivered a graduation speech emphasizing shared humanity and global unity, which has gained significant attention. This comes as the Trump administration intensifies its scrutiny of Chinese students in the U.S., threatening to revoke visas for those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Jiang's speech coincided with a federal judge blocking a Department of Homeland Security order that aimed to restrict international student enrollment at Harvard, which the White House accuses of having ties to the Chinese Communist Party, further highlighting the tensions between the U.S. and China regarding education and national security. The speech underscores the importance of international collaboration and understanding amidst growing geopolitical tensions. The optimism score of this article is 70.</p>

          <p>The women of the "No Sex for Fish" cooperative in Kenya, who gained independence by rejecting sexual exploitation in exchange for fish, now face new challenges. Disastrous floods have devastated their village and disrupted their fishing business, and U.S. aid cutbacks are causing anxiety about their access to life-saving anti-retroviral drugs, as eleven of the women are HIV positive. While the Trump administration claims the drug supply will not be interrupted, local health officials report interruptions in the supply chain due to the cutbacks, leading to clinic closures and job losses for health workers. Despite the uncertainty, the women are supporting each other through a savings association and hoping for assistance to start farming rice. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out in a hospital ward for elderly patients in Hamburg, resulting in the deaths of three people. Around 220 emergency workers responded to the scene at the Marienkrankenhaus shortly after midnight, where they battled the blaze and treated patients. Two individuals were transported to another hospital for treatment, with one person sustaining life-threatening injuries, and eighteen others suffered serious injuries while fifteen more sustained minor wounds. Firefighters used ladders and escape hoods to rescue patients, some of whom were elderly and had mobility issues, and while the cause of the fire is currently unknown, firefighters managed to prevent the flames from spreading to other parts of the hospital.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These nanoparticles convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, although the resulting images are somewhat blurred, and additional lenses are required to partially compensate for this effect. While not as powerful as traditional night vision goggles, the lenses could have applications in surgery, encryption, and counterfeit protection, and the lenses work even better with closed eyes.

The incidents occurred ahead of planned peace talks aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's Investigative Committee linked the incidents, suggesting they were deliberate acts of sabotage, and while there was no immediate comment from Ukraine, a Ukrainian military intelligence agency reported derailing a Russian military train in a Russian-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region. Russian politicians blamed Ukraine for the bridge explosions, claiming it was an attempt to undermine the peace talks, which the United States has been pushing for.

This funding has become an important resource for researchers amid declining operational subsidies to national universities and a decreasing student population. The ministry's program, which began in fiscal year 2015, initially targeted universities, public research institutes, and private companies with a budget of 300 million yen, and in fiscal year 2017, it expanded to include large-scale research projects, increasing the total allocation to 11 billion yen.

          <p>A new study reveals that a blood test can provide breast cancer patients with an early warning sign that their current medication is losing effectiveness. This allows women to switch drugs sooner than waiting for traditional scans to show cancer progression, which ultimately improves their quality of life. The new approach offers a more proactive and less stressful way to manage treatment, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients. The optimism score for this article is 80.</p>

          <p>The closure of Joann craft-supply stores marks the end of an era, creating distance between materials and makers and potentially diminishing opportunities for creative expression and community building. While crafting can still be done through online orders and smaller specialty shops, the tactile experience and accessibility of stores like Joann are lost, and the closure creates ever more distance between materials and makers. Crafting has a rich history in America, serving as a means of political expression and community connection, and the loss of a reliable institution like Joann may discourage people from exploring their creative side.

The series explores themes of interpretation, faith, and the role of religion in a changing world, and L√©a's confidence grows as she learns how to give sense to the rituals.

          <p>Recent incidents and near misses at Newark Liberty International Airport have raised concerns about the safety of air travel, and these issues are not isolated to Newark but reflect a systemic problem across the U.S. aviation system. Staffing shortages, infrastructure problems, and outdated technology are contributing to the crisis, and air traffic controllers are facing burnout due to mandatory overtime and inadequate cost-of-living increases. While the FAA has announced some improvements and new funding, it may only be a short-term fix as the cost of living continues to outpace replacement levels at air traffic control centers, and the number of flights may need to be reduced to address these issues.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough choices are unavoidable as the government finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including the NHS, defense, schools, and the criminal justice system. The level of spending on health will dictate whether cuts are made to "unprotected" areas, and while funding increased sharply in 2024, it will no longer increase year on year due to government commitments. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance on borrowing and taxes has led to speculation about spending cuts, and the IFS suggests that the government has "front-loaded" its spending, meaning spending will slow down.

          <p>The article argues that to fight back against Trump's policies, we must look to poor people‚Äôs movements for inspiration, highlighting the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO). The NWRO, led by poor Black women, staged mass marches and demonstrations, challenging racist policies and advocating for a "guaranteed adequate income." The "Johnnie Tillmon model" emphasizes uniting the poor across differences, building visionary projects of survival, and operating as an independent force in public life. The article suggests that by harnessing the ingenuity and brilliance within poor communities, a transformational power can be unleashed to challenge the status quo and create lasting change.
