          <p>England's Red Roses delivered a commanding 69-17 victory over the United States in a Women's Rugby World Cup match, played before a record-breaking crowd of 42,723. This emphatic win marked their 28th consecutive triumph, with Ellie Kildunne delivering a player-of-the-match performance, scoring two tries and assisting two others, solidifying her status as a tournament face. Despite the team's smooth execution and strong scrum, head coach John Mitchell highlighted the need for improvement in areas like midfield passing and defensive pressure, indicating a strategic focus on refining skills for the increasingly challenging knockout rounds. The team remains committed to building on this strong start to achieve new heights, fueling an appetite for improvement that bodes ill for their rivals.</p>

          <p>A tour bus traveling back from Niagara Falls tragically overturned on Interstate 90 in Pembroke, Upstate New York, causing at least four deaths, including one child, and injuring dozens more. Many of the 52 passengers, predominantly of Indian, Chinese, or Filipino descent, were ejected or trapped, leading to a massive emergency response involving medical helicopters. The vehicle reportedly lost control for unexplained reasons, veering into the median before crashing into a ditch, prompting Governor Kathy Hochul to coordinate rescue efforts. Area hospitals are treating a high volume of patients with injuries ranging from cuts to severe fractures, though most are anticipated to recover as the investigation unfolds.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly issued a directive preventing U.S. intelligence agencies from sharing information regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with Five Eyes allies (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand). The July 20 memo classified this intelligence as "NOFORN," limiting its distribution to originating agencies and publicly released information. While a DNI spokesperson later called the reporting false, former intelligence officials warn such a move could undermine crucial alliances and trust, potentially leading partners to create new channels without U.S. input. Critics argue it risks isolating the U.S. from partners and hindering a common intelligence picture, although others deem such directives commonplace for diverging interests.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have retrieved ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria, Egypt, dating back over 2,000 years. These historic treasures are believed to be from an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, which existed during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire. Damage to the statues, such as missing heads and feet, suggests a natural disaster like an earthquake or tsunami caused the city's submersion. This discovery confirms the area was once a thriving residential city and port, offering crucial insights into Alexandria's rich history as it faces modern threats from rising sea levels.</p>

Concurrently, over 600 staff were laid off, dismantling critical public health programs in HIV prevention, maternal and child health, and injury prevention, including firearm-related studies, eroding decades of established work and workforce morale. Employees describe the process as isolating, highlighting a stark message that the agency's scientific foundations are being questioned while misinformation persists.</p>

This momentum shift, coupled with regulatory tailwinds boosting institutional interest in stablecoins (many powered by Ethereum), has positioned ether as a leading crypto asset.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plunged, shedding almost $100 million in market value, following the release of its new logo that removes the traditional overall-clad man. This redesign, part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to modernize the 55-year-old chain, aims to refresh its image with new menu items and redecorated stores, moving away from its old-timey approach. While the company stated its core values are unchanged, the stock drop and criticism from conservative commentators, who labeled the rebrand "woke," indicate investor and public skepticism. Marketing experts noted the unusual market reaction, suggesting political opportunism rather than a pure marketing misstep, highlighting the risks of alienating long-time fans.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), following a preliminary assessment of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities that angered President Trump. The DIA's report indicated a setback of only "months" to Iran's program, directly contradicting Trump's assertion of "completely and totally obliterated" facilities. This firing is part of a broader pattern of upheaval in military and intelligence agencies under the Trump administration, where officials whose data or analysis diverge from the President's narrative are often removed. This trend, which includes other top military officials, raises significant concerns about the politicization of intelligence and stability within national security leadership.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced one of its best days in months, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 845 points, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated a shift towards potentially lowering interest rates. In his Jackson Hole address, Powell stated that current economic conditions "may warrant adjusting our policy stance," citing considerably slowed job growth and rising downside risks to employment, despite pressure from President Trump to hold off. This strong indication suggests a potential September rate cut, aiming to bolster the labor market. The Fed, tasked with balancing full employment and inflation, noted higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in certain categories. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador and alleging torture, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is returning to Maryland under a federal judge's order. This ruling prevents immigration authorities from immediately detaining him, requiring his return to supervised release under the Baltimore ICE office, and mandates 72 hours' notice for any future deportation attempts to a third country. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem strongly criticized the release, labeling Abrego Garcia an "MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator," allegations his family and attorneys deny. His attorneys accuse prosecutors of "vindictive and selective prosecution" in the human smuggling charges, with his trial set for January 2027.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of American retirees rely on Social Security, but many are unaware that their benefits can be reduced by several factors beyond early claiming, making every dollar crucial. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an "earnings test," temporarily reducing payments based on income thresholds. Medicare Part B premiums are automatically deducted, with high-income earners facing higher Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA) that can significantly increase costs. Additionally, federal income taxes can apply to up to 85% of benefits if combined income exceeds certain thresholds, often surprising retirees. Understanding these potential reductions is crucial for comprehensive retirement planning, with options like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities available to supplement income.

          <p>An opinion article strongly criticizes Donald Trump's reported critique of the Smithsonian Institution's focus on "how bad slavery was," viewing it as part of a broader, disturbing effort to micro-manage exhibits and replace historical truth with "unifying and constructive descriptions." The author argues this attempt to whitewash history, removing "bad" aspects like slavery and the civil rights movement, is a grave insult to Black and Indigenous Americans and hinders understanding of the present by obscuring how the nation arrived at its current moment. The piece suggests such actions aim to convince the public that truth doesn't matter, potentially paving the way for repeating past brutalities without consequence or accountability.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the FBI raid on former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home and office, investigating potential mishandling of classified material, with President Trump disavowing knowledge and calling Bolton a "lowlife." This sentiment of unpopularity extends to some Democrats and even a neighbor, highlighting Bolton's controversial public persona. The investigation is likely unrelated to his long-standing dispute with Trump over his memoir, published without full government clearance, which alleged Trump's administration slow-rolled the review. Despite his meticulous nature, Bolton's cockiness and memory "brimming with so many secrets" could lead to an unguarded moment, as the FBI director emphasizes that "NO ONE is above the law" amidst calls to "de-weaponize the FBI."</p>

          <p>California and Texas are embroiled in a significant redistricting battle that could reshape the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives, affecting more than 70 million Americans. Texas Republicans initiated the conflict by redrawing maps mid-decade to create five new congressional seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to respond by crafting their own maps to boost Democratic representation by five seats. This "political arms race" highlights the practice of gerrymandering, which is legal unless racially motivated, and the unusual mid-decade efforts by both parties to gain partisan advantage. The Supreme Court previously limited federal courts' power to block political gerrymandering, intensifying the political stakes as other states also consider similar measures.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rallied following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech, which strongly signaled upcoming interest rate cuts, potentially as early as this fall. However, Powell cautioned that long-term "neutral" rates might be higher than in the 2010s, implying borrowing costs like mortgages may not return to pre-pandemic lows, a point that could displease President Trump. The Fed aims for a "Goldilocks balance" between employment and inflation, which has seen recent increases due to Trump's tariffs, causing price growth. The labor market's "curious kind of balance" and slowing economic activity are key factors driving the Fed's openness to rate adjustments, though Powell's overall tone was far from optimistic, hinting at limits to monetary policy's ability to counter executive policies.

          <p>Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, renowned for riding Secretariat to the Triple Crown in 1973, has died at 84 from natural causes at his home in New Brunswick. Turcotte's iconic achievement with Secretariat, including the record-setting 31-length win at the Belmont Stakes that still stands 52 years later, ended a 25-year Triple Crown drought in horse racing. His nearly two-decade career, which included over 3,000 wins, ended prematurely in 1978 after a racing accident left him paraplegic. Despite his personal challenges, Turcotte remained an inspiration and advocate for fellow fallen riders, earning induction into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1979 for his enduring legacy.</p>

The court's majority rejected arguments for dismissal, emphasizing the need for small business owners to be heard during chaotic times and stating that the Governor was not the only one facing uncertainty.

Despite her conviction for sex trafficking, she maintained her innocence and that she was wrongly accused, even likening the public pursuit of Epstein's associates to a "Salem witch trial."
