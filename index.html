          <p>A powerful gas station explosion in a southeastern Rome neighborhood has injured at least 25 people, including ten first responders who were investigating a reported gas leak. The blast, which was heard across the city, caused a massive fire and sent a large plume of smoke into the sky, leading to widespread devastation of nearby vehicles and buildings. Authorities reported that two of the sixteen injured residents are in severe condition. An investigation has been launched into the cause, which may be linked to a gas leak during an LPG unloading process, while officials noted that the swift evacuation of a nearby sports center prevented a far greater tragedy.</p>

          <p>Reigning champion Miki Sudo won her 11th Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in the women's division, consuming 33 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island, New York, saw Sudo pull ahead in the second half of the competition to secure the victory, though she finished well below her 2024 world record of 51. In the men's competition, all eyes are on Joey Chestnut, who is returning after being banned last year, as he aims to reclaim his title. The contest follows strict rules, including a ten-minute time limit and disqualification for vomiting, with winners receiving a $20,000 prize.</p>

          <p>The UK Attorney General's Office will review the seven-year sentence of a 15-year-old boy convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire. Mr. Kohli was racially abused and physically attacked by the boy in a park, an incident filmed by a 13-year-old girl. The attack resulted in fatal injuries, including a fractured spine. The victim's family expressed disappointment with the initial sentence, and the Solicitor General has now referred the case to the Court of Appeal under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, which could result in an increased punishment for the boy.</p>

          <p>A 90-day freeze on extensive new U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The Trump administration has announced new trade pacts with some nations, but deals with many others remain unresolved, threatening to trigger sharply higher import duties. Experts suggest the deadline may be extended for countries negotiating in good faith, but the prolonged uncertainty could hinder investment and economic growth. The potential implementation of these tariffs, including a baseline 10% duty plus country-specific rates, raises concerns about inflation and market instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton swiftly won his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata, needing only 70 seconds to secure victory after the game was controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light. Shelton, who was serving for the match when play was halted, returned to the court and fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to close out the win. He later explained his frustration with the previous night's decision, which was made because the Hawk-Eye line-calling system was about to shut down. Despite the bizarre circumstances, Shelton found humor in the situation and advanced to the third round.</p>

          <p>The recently announced U.S. trade deal with Vietnam, which includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped from other countries, is seen as a direct challenge to China. Chinese manufacturers have increasingly used Vietnam to reroute goods to the U.S. to avoid hefty tariffs. However, economists and trade experts are questioning how the new rules will be enforced, particularly how to define what constitutes a transshipped product versus one with minimal Chinese components. The deal signals a broader U.S. strategy to use bilateral trade negotiations to pressure China and curb its influence in global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

While an editorial called for tighter regulations on such sales to minors, Pop Mart's primary demographic consists of young adults, not children. Furthermore, the company's significant and rapidly growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic regulatory impacts. Despite challenges like scalpers and production delays, the brand's appeal, driven by what some call the "dopamine economy," remains strong amid China's otherwise sluggish consumer market.

          <p>An opinion article draws a parallel between the British imposition of martial law in Boston in the 1770s and contemporary concerns about military presence in U.S. cities. The author argues that while taxes like the Stamp Act ignited conflict, it was the Coercive Acts of 1774, which effectively placed Massachusetts under military rule, that transformed resistance into a full-blown revolution. This escalation, intended to punish a few for the Boston Tea Party, united the colonies against what they saw as tyranny. The article uses this historical example as a cautionary tale, suggesting that military overreach on domestic soil can provoke unpredictable violence and lasting civil discord.</p>

The case has drawn significant attention, especially as a U.S. judge has issued a gag order to prevent public statements that could prejudice Ábrego García's human-smuggling trial in Tennessee.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike targeting a Hamas operative at the al-Baqa Cafeteria in Gaza City resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women and children. The BBC has confirmed at least 26 of the fatalities, who were artists, students, and cafe staff gathered at the popular seaside spot. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated it was targeting terrorists and took steps to mitigate civilian harm, but the incident is under review. The target was identified by sources as Hisham Ayman Mansour, a mid-ranking Hamas field commander. The high civilian death toll has intensified questions about the proportionality of Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is set to hold its 17th summit in Brazil, aiming to project unity after a recent expansion that brought its membership to ten countries. The forum, which positions itself as a counterweight to Western-led institutions, will focus on strengthening Global South cooperation. However, the summit will be marked by the notable absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This gives other leaders, like India's Narendra Modi, an opportunity to take a more prominent role, even as the bloc grapples with internal disagreements and challenges in translating its economic weight into cohesive geopolitical influence.</p>

Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has had an impressive run, defeating the 20th seed in the first round. Her success could see her become the top-ranked British player, marking a remarkable rise for the athlete who is now the fourth unseeded British woman to reach this stage this century.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered what they describe as a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them on a large scale to extract nutritious fat. This finding challenges the stereotype of Neanderthals as unintelligent, indicating they possessed sophisticated planning, organizational skills, and an understanding of nutrition. They likely rendered the fat to avoid protein poisoning, a dangerous condition resulting from a diet of lean meat, showcasing their ability to strategically exploit their environment for survival.</p>

Peroni was 27 when she vanished after being seen walking into a wooded area with her then-boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, during a party in Selma, Oregon. The case went cold for years until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through new DNA analysis.

          <p>Iran has officially announced it will suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) following recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes on its nuclear facilities. The move raises questions about the future of international monitoring and whether Iran will remain in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran's nuclear program, which began in the 1950s with U.S. support, has advanced significantly, with the country now enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. After the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran has expanded its capabilities, and experts warn that recent attacks could push Tehran to pursue a nuclear weapon for defensive purposes.</p>

          <p>Amid his feud with President Trump, Elon Musk's suggestion of creating a new "America Party" faces substantial legal and logistical challenges. Starting a third party in the U.S. requires navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are often designed to favor the existing two-party system. This process involves collecting vast numbers of signatures, meeting specific vote percentage thresholds, and likely facing intense legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans. While Musk's immense wealth could fund such an effort, experts say it would be a time-consuming and expensive multi-year project, making it an unlikely venture before the 2026 midterms.</p>

The criticism comes after Germany's Interior Minister expressed openness to making direct agreements with the Taliban to facilitate deportations.

It is partially funded by significant changes to Medicaid and SNAP, including new work requirements and eligibility checks, which the CBO estimates will cause millions to lose health coverage.
