        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Conservative Party has formally demanded that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer disclose the full extent of his knowledge regarding Lord Mandelson's controversial links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. This intense scrutiny follows Mandelson's recent sacking from his ambassadorial role, with Tories questioning Starmer's judgment and demanding the release of related government documents. The scandal, emerging shortly after Angela Rayner's resignation, has amplified internal criticism within the Labour Party, with some MPs expressing concerns about Starmer's leadership ahead of upcoming local elections. Mandelson has repeatedly expressed regret over his past association with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown intensified in August, with key indicators like retail sales, industrial output, and fixed-asset investment falling below analyst expectations. Retail sales grew by 3.4% (vs. 3.9% forecast), industrial output by 5.2% (vs. 5.7% in July), and fixed-asset investment by a mere 0.5%. The real estate sector's contraction worsened, and urban unemployment slightly rose, attributed to the graduation season. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged "unstable and uncertain factors" in the external environment, calling for macro policies to stabilize employment, businesses, and market expectations to foster healthy economic development.

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, praising his commitment to public safety and making New York City affordable. Despite past disagreements, Hochul expressed confidence in Mamdani's leadership, particularly his focus on confronting former President Trump's agenda. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has recently distanced himself from some prior positions, including apologizing for a 2020 social media post that called the NYPD "racist." This endorsement comes as other prominent New York Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have yet to back a candidate in the race against incumbent Eric Adams and former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>Two men, Adeeb Nasir (58) and Adil Justice Ahmed Nasir (31), have been arrested in Salt Lake City, Utah, after an incendiary device was discovered under a Fox 13 news vehicle.

Following the arrests, investigators searched their residence, locating firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction, leading to evacuations in neighboring areas. Both suspects were legally prohibited from owning firearms due to histories of illicit drug use, and they are being held without bail.</p>

          <p>The Indianapolis Colts secured a surprising 29-28 victory over the Denver Broncos in an improbable finish, thanks to a game-changing leverage penalty against Denver as time expired. This penalty, called for illegally using a teammate to elevate for a block, granted the Colts an untimed down, allowing Spencer Shrader to convert a 45-yard field goal for the win. Denver's own critical mistakes, including a missed field goal and a costly fourth-quarter interception by quarterback Bo Nix, also contributed to their defeat. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones continued his impressive start to the season with another efficient performance, leading his team to a 2-0 record.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which prohibits most local and federal law enforcement officers, including those involved in immigration enforcement, from wearing face masks during operations. The bill, introduced by Democratic state senators, aims to enhance transparency and foster public trust in law enforcement, though it includes exemptions for SWAT teams, approved undercover assignments, and medical masks. Supporters argue it will also prevent impersonation of officers. Concurrently, Senate Bill 805, requiring officers to clearly display identification, also passed, underscoring a legislative push for greater accountability and public confidence in law enforcement.</p>

The workers, alleged to have overstayed visas or held incorrect permits, were subsequently repatriated. South Korea's president had earlier warned that the raid could discourage future investment, while Korean trade unions have called for an official apology from Trump.</p>

It offers practical advice, emphasizing the importance of deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5-10 minutes. These "mental buffers" allow the brain to reset, process information, and prepare for subsequent tasks, ultimately helping to cut through the mental haze and improve cognitive function.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly seeking $58 million from Congress to bolster security for the executive and judicial branches, specifically including enhanced protection for Supreme Court justices. This urgent request follows the recent fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. A White House official confirmed the funds would be directed to the U.S. Marshals Service. The administration also expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, with both the House and Senate considering additional safety precautions and a review of existing programs. This critical funding request comes ahead of a September 30 government funding deadline, amidst a significant rise in threats against public officials.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is "not cooperating" with authorities, hindering efforts to establish a clear motive. The governor indicated that information from Robinson's family and friends suggests he held left-leaning political beliefs and harbored a dislike for Kirk. Notably, ammunition found with the weapon used in the targeted attack was engraved with taunting, anti-fascist, and meme-culture messages, including "Hey, fascist! Catch!". Robinson, who had no prior felony convictions, is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday, when official charges and more evidence are expected to be released.</p>

The author contends that Jarmond has steered the football program into a "steaming wreckage" by failing to manage coaches effectively and making questionable hiring decisions. Despite Jarmond's successes in other sports, the article emphasizes football's critical importance for revenue and national reputation. It suggests that Chancellor Julio Frenk must intervene to prevent a third consecutive coaching misfire, advocating for a new approach to leadership for the program.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has died at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Edgar is widely credited with guiding the state to greater financial stability during the 1990s recession, implementing tough budget cuts and successfully making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent to secure funding for public schools. A moderate Republican, he later became a prominent figure among Republicans who openly opposed Donald Trump's presidency, actively supporting Kamala Harris's presidential bid. His legacy is remembered for integrity and effective governance, with Illinois Governor JB Pritzker ordering state flags to fly at half-staff in his honor.</p>

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Murphy's analysis highlights individual mistakes, such as Bruno Fernandes's defensive lapses when played in a deeper midfield role and Luke Shaw's struggles as a center-back, as critical factors costing the team points. Despite tactical improvements in team compactness, these individual errors undermine their performance. Murphy contends that Amorim must recognize these issues and deploy players more effectively within the system to prevent continued setbacks, suggesting a need for better player-role alignment.</p>

For nations like North Korea, the parade offered diplomatic legitimacy without demanding internal reforms.
