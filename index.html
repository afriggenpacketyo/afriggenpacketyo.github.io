          <p>The White House announced President Trump fired CDC Director Susan Monarez after her refusal to resign, citing a lack of alignment with his administration's mission. Monarez's attorney claims she was targeted for prioritizing public health over political agendas, specifically clashing with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. This high-profile dismissal marks the latest in a series of leadership changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency also grappling with the aftermath of a recent attack on its Atlanta headquarters. The administration plans to name a new director very soon, aiming to reform the agency's approach to public health and its scientific directives.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official, resigned, criticizing the Trump administration for allegedly attempting to "erase transgender populations" and dismantle critical HIV programming. His resignation letter, shared on social media, included the term "pregnant people" and his pronouns, sparking controversy among critics who questioned the use of such language in a scientific context. Daskalakis stated he was unable to serve in an environment where the CDC was used to generate policies that did not reflect scientific reality and were designed to hurt public health. This event highlights ongoing tensions between public health experts and political directives, underscoring a deep ideological divide within the federal health agency regarding scientific integrity.</p>

          <p>This editorial argues that Russia's heavy air raid on Kyiv, occurring shortly after a US special envoy's visit, signifies President Putin's continued testing of President Trump's resolve. Despite Trump's threats of "severe consequences," his anger has yet to translate into effective action, with the article suggesting his policies are often driven by domestic politics rather than a coherent Russia strategy. European leaders are seen as making maximal efforts with limited influence on the US worldview, as intelligence sharing on potential Ukraine-Russia deals has reportedly ceased. The situation highlights a dangerous diplomatic impasse and ongoing conflict, underscoring the complexities of international relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new World Health Organization report indicates that one in four people globally lack access to safe drinking water, with 3.4 billion lacking reliable sanitation systems. Amaka Godfrey, executive director at WaterAid, shares her personal experiences growing up in Nigeria without basic water access, highlighting the stark disparity between low-income and wealthier countries. While significant progress has been made since 2000 in expanding water access to 2.2 billion people, rural areas and rapidly growing urban populations still face substantial gaps. Increased investment and improved infrastructure are crucial to address this persistent global challenge and ensure fundamental needs are met.</p>

          <p>The family of 18-year-old Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz was shocked after ICE transferred him from California to Arizona and then Louisiana without their knowledge, before returning him to Adelanto. Congresswoman Luz Rivas, who reviewed the case, introduced legislation requiring ICE to notify families of detainee transfers within 24 hours, contrasting with current rules only mandating notification upon death. This incident reflects a broader pattern under the Trump administration's expanded deportation initiative, which has led to overcrowded facilities and a majority of arrests involving individuals without criminal convictions. The lack of transparency and communication is causing significant psychological distress for families across the nation.</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport announced the first electric vehicles eligible for a £3,750 government discount, aiming to encourage a shift from petrol and diesel cars. Models like Ford's Puma Gen-E qualify for the maximum reduction, with 26 others receiving £1,500 discounts, automatically applied at the point of sale. While the government aims to ban new fossil fuel car sales by 2030, high upfront costs and insufficient charging points remain significant barriers for many drivers. The £650 million scheme, available for three years, seeks to make EVs more affordable, bringing their prices closer to conventional counterparts and accelerating adoption.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit against President Trump primarily focuses on the legal standard of "cause" for her removal, rather than directly refuting mortgage fraud allegations. The complaint argues that the fraud claims are "pretextual" and do not meet the legal threshold for removal under the Federal Reserve Act, which mandates Senate confirmation and a 14-year term. Critics, including FHFA Director Bill Pulte, note Cook's lack of direct denial regarding the mortgage documents, questioning the integrity of her position. This legal battle tests the Fed's independence and could set a precedent for future presidential authority over the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines three key strategies for Americans to maximize their Social Security retirement benefits, which are a vital financial lifeline for many. Delaying claims beyond full retirement age can increase benefits by 8% annually, while continuing to work longer can replace lower-earning years in the 35-year calculation. Married couples are advised to coordinate spousal benefits strategically to ensure the higher earner's benefit is preserved for the survivor. The article also suggests supplementing income with annuities, reverse mortgages, and diversified retirement portfolios to achieve greater financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

While a money market account might offer slightly higher returns over shorter periods due to variable rates, CDs provide guaranteed returns, which could be more appealing as federal funds rates are expected to decline. The analysis shows that for a one-year term, both could yield similar returns, but the fixed nature of a CD offers security against falling rates. Savers are advised to weigh guaranteed returns against potential variable gains to optimize their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment trends in the energy sector are evolving, moving beyond traditional oil and gas majors towards power generation, influenced by surging demand from AI data centers and Trump administration policies. Despite positive returns for oil and gas stocks, ETFs like XLE have seen outflows, while utilities sector ETFs like XLU have seen inflows and superior performance. Experts note a shift in investor thinking towards energy as "power" rather than just fossil fuels, with significant investment needed for the US electric grid to meet future demand. This suggests a long-term transformation in energy investment strategies and infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kim Harvey has been named the new executive producer of "CBS Evening News," replacing Guy Campanile, as the program continues to struggle with viewership declines since its recent revamp. The newscast, which had shifted to a co-anchor format and longer stories, has failed to compete effectively against rivals like ABC and NBC. Harvey's appointment, a trusted former lieutenant of previous anchor Norah O’Donnell, signals potential larger changes, including a possible return to a single anchor and a more traditional news approach. This leadership change comes amidst speculation about the future of CBS News following its acquisition by Skydance Media.</p>

          <p>The European Union formally proposed removing tariffs on US industrial goods, fulfilling a key aspect of the US-EU framework trade agreement.

The European Commission stated these steps aim to restore stability and predictability in transatlantic trade relations, benefiting businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. The proposal, which requires approval from the European Parliament and Council, follows weeks of tense negotiations and President Trump's earlier announcement of a 15% tariff on most European goods.</p>
