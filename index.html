          <p>A massive explosion and fire at the Shahid Rajaee port in southern Iran resulted in at least 14 deaths and hundreds of injuries. The blast, potentially linked to improperly handled sodium perchlorate rocket fuel, occurred during U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, raising security concerns. Investigations are underway to determine the exact cause, with initial reports citing a stockpile of hazardous materials.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who are legally in the U.S., criticizing the government's evidence linking them to a gang. Judge David Briones barred the administration from removing anyone under the Alien Enemies Act in the Western District of Texas without proper notice. The couple, who had Temporary Protected Status, were arrested based on claims of gang affiliation, which the judge found unsubstantiated. The judge said they were accused of being members of the gang “without providing this Court with a single piece of meaningful evidence.”</p>

Some learners are resorting to paid apps to secure slots, and many are having to pay for refresher lessons due to the long wait times.</p>

Healthcare has become a key issue in the upcoming election, with both major parties promising additional funding, but experts argue that sweeping reforms are needed to save the system.
