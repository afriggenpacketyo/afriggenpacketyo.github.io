        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era guidance requiring hospitals to perform emergency abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The previous guidance mandated abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it served as a "stabilizing medical treatment." HHS and CMS stated that the rescinded guidance "do not reflect the policy of this Administration," while affirming that EMTALA still protects individuals seeking emergency treatment, including pregnant women. Abortion rights groups have criticized the move, while the ACLU maintains that hospitals still have a legal obligation to provide life-saving abortion care.</p>

Security footage shows Charlo with her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, on the night she disappeared, and DeFrance's changing stories have raised suspicion. Cellphone data placed Charlo's phone in an area where DeFrance was living, and he later admitted to discarding the phone in Idaho. DeFrance was arrested on firearms possession charges but his conviction was later overturned, and the investigation into Charlo's disappearance remains active, with her family still seeking justice and closure. </p>

          <p>Israel has announced record-breaking weapons sales for the past year, highlighting its pursuit of new markets as its forces engage in ongoing battles on multiple fronts.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination" and urging voters to contact their representatives to oppose it. Musk's opposition comes after a brief stint as a "special government employee" focused on cutting government spending. His criticism, focused on the bill's potential to increase the US budget deficit and national debt, could influence Republican senators already concerned about the bill's fiscal impact. While the White House attempts to downplay Musk's comments, his influence could make it more difficult for Trump to secure Senate approval for the legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional forecasters project that President Trump's tariffs could reduce the federal deficit by $2.8 trillion over the next decade, assuming they remain in place. This potential deficit reduction could offset the $2.4 trillion increase projected from the House-passed budget bill. However, the forecast includes caveats, acknowledging the limited empirical evidence on the effects of tariffs of this size. Forecasters also anticipate that the tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Senate Finance Committee Republicans to garner support for his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which faces opposition due to concerns about its impact on the deficit. The bill includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts and increased spending on military and border security, but could add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Some Republican senators, like Ron Johnson, are pushing for deeper spending cuts, while others express frustration with Elon Musk's criticism of the bill. The goal is to pass the bill by the Fourth of July, but disagreements within the Republican party pose a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his criticism of President Donald Trump's proposed tax-cut bill, asserting it would lead to "debt slavery" for the United States. Musk has encouraged citizens to contact their senators and congressmen to "KILL the BILL," arguing it would significantly increase the national debt. This opposition follows Musk's departure from the Trump administration, where he led the government-shrinking group known as DOGE. Musk's stance is partly motivated by the bill's elimination of an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several documents in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The order comes in response to a request from a media coalition, including CBS News, citing the public's right to access court records. The Justice Department had opposed the release, arguing that the filings were discovery materials and that sealing them was necessary for national security. The Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was a mistake, as he had been granted legal status in the U.S.</p>
