          <h2>Rubio Defends US Response to Myanmar Earthquake Amid Aid Agency Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 00:54:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Marco Rubio addressed criticism regarding the US response to the Myanmar earthquake, citing the need to balance global humanitarian efforts with national interests and the challenges of working with the military junta in Myanmar. He refuted claims that cuts to USAID, led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, hindered the US's ability to deploy a large rescue team. Rubio emphasized that the US is prepared to help and work with governments and appropriate NGOs on the ground, while also urging other rich countries like China and India to contribute to the relief efforts. He also criticized NGOs that receive large sums of US taxpayer money but spend excessive amounts to deliver aid.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The Japanese Grand Prix's final practice was twice halted due to trackside fires, with Lando Norris leading Oscar Piastri to a McLaren one-two. The fires, believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting dry grass, prompted concerns for the race's safety. Despite mitigation efforts after similar incidents on Friday, the issue persisted, leading the FIA to focus on dampening the grass before qualifying. The FIA stated that all available time and resources will be focused on further dampening the grass before the session.&#x20;</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Delta, Ohio, a town with strong support for Donald Trump, residents generally welcome the president's new tariffs despite concerns about potential price increases and market instability. Many believe the tariffs will level the playing field in international trade and bring jobs back to the US, even if it means some short-term economic pain. While the automotive industry in neighboring states faces potential disruptions, local steel businesses see an opportunity in increased protectionism. Residents express a willingness to endure economic challenges if it revitalizes American industry, reflecting a broader sentiment of wanting action and change.&#x20;</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of a 10% tariff on nearly all imports has taken effect, exacerbating a global stock market downturn already reeling from the announcement of sweeping trade taxes. Higher tariffs on specific countries, including a 34% tax on Chinese goods, are scheduled to follow. The UK's FTSE 100 experienced its worst daily drop in over five years, and US indexes also plummeted, wiping trillions off the global stock market. World leaders expressed concern about an all-out trade war, while Trump defended the tariffs as a means to "supercharge" the US economy.&#x20;</p>

The UN aid chief praised humanitarian groups for their response, but the UN also reported restrictions on aid to areas not backing the junta's rule.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike produces almost all of its shoes, have raised concerns about potential price increases for iconic sneakers like the Air Jordan 1s. Nike's shares fell following the tariffs announcement, and analysts predict that the company may have to raise prices by 10-15% to offset the increased costs. While Nike could try to absorb some of the costs by downgrading technology or refreshing designs less frequently, the company's already tight profit margins may force it to pass the levies on to consumers. Despite the challenges, analysts believe it is still too early to say whether Trump's tariff numbers are etched in stone.&#x20;</p>

          <p>The article discusses the dangers of misinformation and manipulation in the modern world, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence. It draws a parallel to Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, who was duped by a misinformation scandal involving photographs of fairies. The article warns against falling victim to false information, highlighting the importance of critical thinking and skepticism. In 1917, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her sixteen-year-old cousin Elsie Wright from Cottingley, England, claimed to have seen fairies by a stream.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a company known for imposing £100 charges on drivers taking more than five minutes to pay, has been ordered to pay £10,240 in costs to a charity after losing a court case. The case involved Hannah Robinson, who was wrongly charged £11,390 for parking at a car park in Darlington. Robinson struggled to pay within five minutes due to poor phone signal and issues with the payment app. The judge ruled that Excel's conduct was unreasonable and out of the norm.&#x20;</p>

          <p>A woman in her mid-70s discovered through a home DNA test that she was swapped at birth with another baby in a busy NHS maternity ward in the 1950s. The discovery was made after a stranger contacted her through a genealogy website, claiming to be her genetic sibling. The woman had always felt different from her family, but the DNA test confirmed that everything she knew about her family history was wrong. The case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC, and lawyers expect more cases to emerge.&#x20;</p>
