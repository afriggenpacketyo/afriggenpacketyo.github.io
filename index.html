        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial hubs such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit growth in the first five months of the year, driven by rising consumer demand, offshore factory investments, and the need to offset losses from high US tariffs. These countries are becoming increasingly important trading partners for China, with closer economic and investment relations. Analysts suggest that some exports may be transshipped through Southeast Asia to bypass US tariffs, with factories adding enough local content to re-export goods as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia. This diversification reflects a strategic shift amid ongoing trade tensions. The article explores how Chinese manufacturers are adapting to global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, leading to a drop in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate slightly increased. According to the Office for National Statistics, there is a weakening trend in the labor market, with a noticeable decline in the number of people on payrolls. Recent increases in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers and the minimum wage may be contributing factors to this hiring slowdown, the article suggests. This news is a reflection of the economic climate's impact on employment trends.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting a loophole in Europe's drug classification system to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for substances like salt during transit. In some countries, ketamine is classified as a legal medicine, resulting in less scrutiny during import and transit, which criminals exploit by transporting it across multiple borders. Belgian investigators have uncovered at least 28 similar consignment switches involving an estimated 28 tonnes of ketamine since 2023. The UK has seen an 85% increase in ketamine consumption between 2023 and 2024, highlighting the scale of the issue. This article explores how organized crime groups are profiting from the dual classification of ketamine and the challenges faced by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Drug deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC indicates that fatal overdoses in this age group have dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold by dealers, and less risky drug use among teens.
