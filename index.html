          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been publicizing a series of military drills, which appear to be a direct response to Taiwan's largest-ever Han Kuang exercise. The PLA's Eastern Theatre Command announced nighttime flight training and coordinated multi-force operations, releasing the information to coincide with Taiwan's 10-day event. While the exact dates of the PLA exercises were not disclosed, Taipei's monitoring confirmed increased military pressure from mainland China. These actions are seen as a strategic demonstration of force and readiness amid heightened regional tensions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims circulating on social media, scientific evidence does not support the assertion that sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. A DW fact-check debunks viral posts, clarifying that rising skin cancer diagnoses are linked to better detection, increased sun exposure, and other complex factors, not sunscreen use. Experts from public health departments affirm that sunscreen is a crucial tool for filtering harmful UV radiation. The rising incidence rates in countries with high sunscreen use, like Australia, are attributed to greater awareness and reporting, while mortality rates have actually declined due to improved treatments.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old Russian woman and her two young daughters were discovered living in a cave within a snake-infested forest in Karnataka, India. Police found the family during a routine patrol intended to warn tourists of potential dangers in the area. The woman, identified as Nina Kutina, had overstayed her visa and told authorities she was meditating and worshipping God in the remote location. Having been there for over a week, she and her children have since been moved to a detention facility for illegal immigrants pending repatriation.</p>

          <p>Russian customs and security services have intercepted a massive 1,800-pound cocaine shipment, valued at over $153 million, hidden within banana containers from Latin America. This marks Russia's largest drug bust from the region this year, with the narcotics found disguised in briquettes labeled with a luxury brand's logo. The operation was initiated based on a tip from foreign partners about a South American criminal group's smuggling plans. This seizure is part of a growing trend where traffickers use banana shipments to conceal drugs, a method seen in recent busts worldwide.</p>

          <p>Parents in Great Britain are facing an average cost of £1,076 per child for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare, according to new data from the charity Coram. Prices have risen, with some regions seeing hikes of up to 13%, driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options. The rising costs of materials, food, and staffing contribute to the price increase, placing a significant financial burden on working families.

          <p>At Donald Trump's request, Texas Republicans are moving to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This controversial mid-decade redistricting effort is seen by critics as a risky and undemocratic maneuver that would further dilute the voting power of the state's growing non-white population. To achieve these gains, Republicans would need to spread their voters from safe districts into more competitive ones, potentially making their own seats more vulnerable. The move has sparked legal and political backlash, with opponents calling the plan discriminatory.</p>

The dissents highlight what they see as the majority's flawed reasoning, complicity in wrongdoing, and disregard for the real-world consequences of its decisions.

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition in Israel is on the brink of collapse, now operating as a de facto minority government after two parties departed. The unraveling is caused by deep divisions over two key issues: military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox community and the strategy for the ongoing war in Gaza. Netanyahu is caught between appeasing his far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners, whose support is essential for his political survival, and yielding to public, judicial, and international pressure. With his coalition unable to legislate, Israel is likely heading toward new elections in early 2026.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly condemned his own supporters as "weaklings" for believing what he calls a "radical left" hoax regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. His base has been increasingly critical of the administration's handling of the matter, suspecting a cover-up to protect elite individuals. This unusual break between Trump and his supporters comes after the Attorney General's conflicting statements about a supposed "client list." The article also notes that a European missile manufacturer is selling components for bombs used in Israeli airstrikes that have killed civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>For the second time in two months, a professional golf tournament in Japan has been disrupted by a bear. The opening day of the Meiji Yasuda Ladies tournament was canceled after a bear was spotted near the first tee at the Sendai Classic Golf Club. This incident follows a similar event in May where another tournament's final round was scrapped due to a bear on the course. Encounters with bears have reached record levels in Japan, attributed to factors like climate change affecting food sources and shrinking human populations in rural areas.</p>

          <p>Germany's fertility rate fell to 1.35 children per woman in 2024, the lowest it has been since 2006, according to the Federal Statistical Office. The rate among women with German citizenship dropped to just 1.23, a low not seen since 1996. This continued decline, which remains well below the population replacement level of 2.1, is fueling concerns about the country's long-term demographic stability and the future sustainability of its pension and healthcare systems. The trend of having children later in life continues, with the average age of mothers at childbirth now at 31.8 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Justice appears to be deprioritizing the prosecution of white-collar crimes unless they align with specific political narratives, such as those involving immigrants or Democratic opponents. Since Trump's return to office, federal prosecutions for financial crimes have declined, and an executive order has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This approach, which critics argue favors corporate interests and political allies, is reflected in a DOJ memo that emphasizes minimizing burdens on businesses, raising concerns about the capacity and willingness to pursue complex corporate fraud.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to show signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.7%, its highest level in four years. Simultaneously, the annual rate of pay growth has slowed, and the number of job vacancies has been in continuous decline for three years. Analysts suggest these indicators make an interest rate cut by the Bank of England in August more probable. The slowdown in hiring is partly attributed by some to the recent increase in employer National Insurance contributions, which has made businesses more cautious about taking on new staff.</p>

He emphasized that the Druze are a strong, unified people who defend each other across borders.

          <p>The Trump administration is fundamentally changing the federal student loan repayment system, a move that consumer advocates warn could leave many borrowers facing unaffordable monthly payments. The popular SAVE plan has been made defunct, and a new bill will significantly reduce the number of available income-driven repayment options for future borrowers. Under the new primary income-based plan, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), monthly payments are projected to be significantly higher than under the previous SAVE plan, increasing the risk of default for many student loan holders.</p>

          <p>Rachel Maskell, one of four Labour MPs suspended for defying party orders, has stated that her expulsion will not silence her. Maskell told the BBC her suspension was a direct result of her role in a backbench rebellion against disability benefit cuts, which ultimately forced the government into a policy U-turn. While she will now sit as an independent, she intends to continue supporting the Labour government but stressed her primary duty is to advocate for her constituents. The suspensions are viewed by many within the party as a message to new MPs about the importance of loyalty.</p>

          <p>China has officially implemented export restrictions on eight key technologies crucial for the manufacturing of electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Effective this week, companies must now obtain government licenses before transferring these technologies abroad. The rules primarily target the production of battery cathodes, including those for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, as well as several technologies for lithium extraction and processing. This move is seen as a strategic effort by Beijing to maintain its dominance in the global EV supply chain by controlling access to its advanced manufacturing know-how.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump, despite his general support for Israel, is uniquely positioned to pressure the Israeli government due to his relative immunity from domestic political fallout. The author, Kenneth Roth, suggests that Trump's transactional nature, desire for accolades like a Nobel Peace Prize, and personal ego could be leveraged to push for a resolution to the Gaza conflict. While Netanyahu's government has pursued policies against a two-state solution, Trump's unpredictable and self-serving approach means a shift in his stance should not be discounted if he perceives a personal or political benefit.</p>

These teams, complete with period-appropriate woolen uniforms and an absence of gloves, offer a unique blend of athletics, history, and humor. The 19th-century rules, such as catching a ball on one bounce for an out and underhand pitching, create a distinct and action-packed version of the game. For players, it combines a love for baseball history with a fun, less-serious athletic endeavor that connects the present with America's past.</p>
