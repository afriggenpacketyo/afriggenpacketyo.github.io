          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly labeled New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, a "communist" following his primary victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, secured a surprise win, causing concern among some business leaders and conservatives over his progressive platform. His proposals include higher corporate taxes, a rent freeze, and increased taxes on the wealthy. Trump's remarks amplify the alarm, suggesting New York would become a "communistic city" under Mamdani's leadership, a claim Mamdani has countered by encouraging people to learn about his actual policies.</p>

          <p>After a six-week manhunt, law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, one of the final two inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish jail. Acting on a citizen's tip submitted directly to the sheriff, authorities located Massey in an Airbnb residence in New Orleans, where he surrendered peacefully. Officials noted that Massey likely had assistance to remain a fugitive for so long and are investigating potential accomplices. With Massey in custody and set to face new charges, the search now focuses entirely on the last remaining escapee, Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer.</p>

Democrats expressed significant frustration over a lack of transparency from the administration regarding recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

          <p>In the closing arguments of his racketeering and sex trafficking trial, Sean "Diddy" Combs's lawyer portrayed the music mogul as the target of a "fake trial" and an overzealous prosecution. The defense attorney argued that the government had "badly exaggerated" evidence, attempting to criminalize a swinger lifestyle and recreational drug use by labeling it a criminal conspiracy. He asserted that the allegations were motivated by money, as accusers seek to drain Combs's wealth through lawsuits. Prosecutors rebutted by stating that the trial was about Combs's pattern of inexcusable behavior and that domestic abuse is not a defense for sex trafficking.</p>

A key indicator to watch will be the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. Meanwhile, Constellation Brands' performance may offer insights into broader consumer trends, including the impact of weight-loss drugs and shifting immigration policies on consumer spending habits.

Taylor stated that after answering the question, he was separated from his family and held in a room with mostly Latino travelers for nearly an hour without explanation. He expressed confusion and anger over the incident, speculating it might have been related to his political affiliations or was part of a broader, intimidating enforcement posture.

          <p>In the face of ongoing Western sanctions and diplomatic isolation since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia is actively working to demonstrate that it still maintains strong international partnerships. At a recent economic conference in Saint Petersburg, the Russian government sought to project an image of stability and global connection, countering narratives of a potential recession. This effort comes as NATO members increase defense spending in response to threats posed by Russia. The conference serves as a key platform for Moscow to showcase its economic and political ties with non-Western countries and assert its continued relevance on the world stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 6-3 decision that significantly limits the power of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against executive actions. The ruling came in a case challenging a presidential order to end birthright citizenship, granting the administration a partial victory by staying the injunctions beyond the specific plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, the decision curtails a key judicial tool used to block presidential policies. The court's liberal justices dissented forcefully, warning the move dangerously weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

The divers had only nine minutes to survey and film the wreck, documenting its crushed bow, smokestacks, and scattered coal cargo.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a dramatic and dangerous expansion of presidential authority. By preventing lower courts from issuing broad stays on executive orders, the ruling effectively allows a president to implement potentially unconstitutional policies while lengthy legal challenges proceed. The author contends this creates a chaotic system where fundamental rights depend on one's geographic location and access to the courts. The decision is framed not as a principled legal stance but as a politically motivated move that gives the current administration unprecedented power to bypass constitutional norms.</p>

His case highlights the situation of noncitizen veterans who can be deported for criminal offenses, even those linked to service-related trauma.</p>

          <p>A resurgence of Tea Party-style fiscal conservatism may be underway within the Republican party, driven by some of the same figures who rose to prominence in 2010. Senators like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are once again raising alarms about federal spending and budget deficits, this time in opposition to a major tax bill proposed by their own party's president. This new wave of dissent faces a different challenge than the original movement, as they are now opposing a popular Republican president rather than a Democrat. The dynamic tests whether their commitment to fiscal discipline can override party loyalty and legislative pressure from leadership.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Haiti, effective in early September. This decision will revoke the legal status and work permits for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants who have lived in the U.S. since a devastating 2010 earthquake. The Department of Homeland Security argued that conditions in Haiti have improved sufficiently for their return, a claim that contrasts with the State Department's own travel advisories warning of extreme danger in the country. Those who lose TPS will become eligible for deportation unless they can secure another form of legal status.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he believes a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, possibly within the next week. The administration has been actively pushing for a pause in the fighting, which began after Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023. A recent proposal involved a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, though Hamas responded with amendments that were deemed unacceptable. The president's optimistic comments come as the conflict continues, with significant pressure on both sides to reach a deal to end hostilities.</p>

          <p>The president of the University of Virginia, James E. Ryan, has resigned amid a federal investigation into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The resignation is reportedly an attempt to resolve pressure from the Trump administration's Justice Department, which has been scrutinizing and demanding the dismantlement of such programs at universities nationwide. Sources indicate the university feared losing federal funding if a compromise was not reached. In his resignation letter, Ryan stated he could not risk the jobs, research funding, and student financial aid that would be jeopardized by fighting the federal government to save his own position.</p>

Experts on gender and race cited in the article argue that such personal attacks are a tactic to distract from substantive policy debates and are often used to target women of color in politics.

          <p>California's legislature approved a new budget designed to close a $12 billion deficit, which involves significant cuts and delays to several progressive initiatives. A key change includes halting new enrollments for undocumented adults in the state's low-income healthcare program, Medi-Cal, starting in 2026. To close the gap, leaders relied on state savings, internal borrowing, and payment deferrals rather than new taxes, but the plan still represents a major blow to the state's goal of universal healthcare. Republicans criticized the budget for not doing enough to address long-term spending issues and future projected deficits.</p>

Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, requiring investments with higher growth potential.
