        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, have been protesting against the government's plan to expand its military operations. Demonstrators fear the plan endangers the lives of the remaining hostages and are calling for a deal to secure their release, even if it means ending the war. The protests reflect significant public and even military dissent, with polls suggesting most Israelis favor a hostage release deal over a wider conflict. International condemnation of the plan is also growing, with several countries denouncing the decision and the UN Security Council set to meet.</p>

Human rights organizations highlight a pattern of ethno-religious cleansing, with over 150,000 people killed in the region over the last decade.

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two fighters, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain injuries sustained in separate bouts during the same event in Tokyo. Both men suffered subdural hematomas, prompting emergency surgeries that were ultimately unsuccessful. The tragic deaths have intensified calls for improved safety regulations in the sport. In response, the Japan Boxing Commission has already announced that certain title fights will be shortened from 12 rounds to 10, as advocates push for stricter medical protocols globally.</p>

          <p>In a contributor piece, the author draws a parallel between the starvation and suffering of her grandmother in the Warsaw ghetto and the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The article argues that the basic human need for food and water must transcend political and ideological conflicts, emphasizing that one people's security cannot be built upon another's deprivation. It critiques the Israeli government's blockade and its claims about the food situation, while also reflecting on how intergenerational trauma shapes perceptions of the conflict. The author calls for a shared sense of humanity to address the urgent needs of starving civilians.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marking 200 days into a hypothetical second term, critics and political commentators are increasingly warning that the Trump administration is moving the country toward authoritarianism. The article cites a series of actions, including calls to prosecute political opponents, the firing of a government statistician after a poor jobs report, and efforts to redraw congressional maps, as evidence of an assault on democratic norms. Analysts who once dismissed such fears now argue that the administration is systematically undermining constitutional pillars and consolidating power in a way that is more calculated and effective than in its first term.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that while many voters were willing to overlook President Trump's character flaws, their confidence in his competence is now eroding, posing a significant political threat.

The article details how economic policies like tariffs are beginning to negatively impact consumers and industries, while massive cuts to federal agencies are disrupting services from medical research to disaster relief. The authors contend that the impression of ineptitude is hardening, a flaw that American voters are less likely to tolerate than corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a frantic escape from Los Angeles ahead of a rumored nuclear attack, is experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Recently restored and re-released, the movie has been attracting sold-out crowds at local screenings, achieving a cult status it lacked upon its initial release. The film's appeal is attributed to its authentic portrayal of its namesake L.A. neighborhood and its unique blend of romance and apocalyptic chaos. It begins as a love story at the La Brea Tar Pits before a misdialed phone call plunges its characters into a race for survival.</p>

          <p>Three authors—Steph Cha, Ivy Pochoda, and Jonathan Lethem—offer distinct fictional glimpses into a future Los Angeles shaped by social, economic, and climate pressures. The stories explore themes of extreme wealth disparity in a deli, the resilience of the Skid Row community in a depopulated city, and a post-flood world where a "Minister of Commemoration" preserves memories of a dry past. Each narrative uses a unique lens to speculate on the city's trajectory. The collection touches upon issues of class, climate change, and the very definition of community in a transformed Southern California.</p>

          <p>As Los Angeles grapples with intensifying droughts and floods, the concept of a "sponge city" is gaining attention as a potential solution. This model, successfully implemented in cities like Bangkok and across China, focuses on replacing impermeable concrete surfaces with absorbent landscapes like parks and wetlands to capture, clean, and store stormwater. The article highlights how this approach not only mitigates flood risk but also replenishes groundwater and creates recreational spaces. While L.A. has initiated similar projects through its Safe Clean Water Program, progress is slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs compared to China's centralized model.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from the book “California Against the Sea” details a pioneering managed retreat project at Gleason Beach, north of San Francisco. Faced with relentless coastal erosion threatening Highway 1, transportation officials chose to move a one-mile stretch of the road more than 350 feet inland rather than continue a failing cycle of repairs. The complex $73 million project involved building a new bridge to allow a creek and wetland ecosystem to heal and migrate naturally with sea-level rise. This challenging compromise serves as a case study for how communities can proactively adapt to climate change by reimagining infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Despite being a focal point of protests against federal immigration raids, California had fewer total ICE arrests than Texas and Florida during the first five months of the Trump administration's second term. An analysis of federal data reveals that while arrests in California saw a dramatic 212% increase, its per-capita arrest rate remains lower than many other states. Experts attribute this difference to a lack of cooperation from local law enforcement in "sanctuary" jurisdictions like California. This forces federal agents to conduct more visible and controversial street-level arrests rather than relying on transfers from local jails.</p>

          <p>Egyptian and Liverpool football star Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA over its tribute to Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, who was recently killed. In a post on social media, UEFA mourned the loss of al-Obeid, known as the "Palestinian Pelé," but did not mention how he died. Salah replied directly, asking UEFA to specify how, where, and why he was killed. According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was shot by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza, a critical context that Salah's comment highlighted as missing from the tribute.</p>

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, Wang Xingxing, predicts that the field of robotics could experience its own "ChatGPT moment" within the next one to three years. He defines this breakthrough as the point when a robot can perform a general task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment for the first time. Speaking at the World Robot Conference in Beijing, Wang expressed that while hardware is advancing, the crucial element of "AI for embodied intelligence" is still lacking. He suggested that new AI models capable of generating interactive world simulations might be key to achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>A small, round piece of a bathroom door lock proved to be crucial evidence in convicting Matthew Ecker for the murder of nurse Alexandra Pennig. Pennig was found with a fatal gunshot wound in her bathroom, and Ecker, who was present, claimed she had locked herself in and died by suicide before he broke the door down. However, investigators found the metal lock piece underneath Pennig's body. This discovery indicated that the door had been forced open before she was shot and fell, directly contradicting Ecker's timeline and leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>A broken water control valve has caused a multi-day service outage for roughly 9,200 households in the Porter Ranch and Granada Hills neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Officials are pleading with all residents, even those whose service has been partially restored, to stop using water for flushing toilets or watering lawns. They warn that continued consumption is lowering pressure in the system and delaying repairs, which involve filling a 10-million-gallon tank that serves the area. The outage, which began during a heatwave, also prompted a boil water advisory for the affected communities.</p>

          <p>Deadly floods have once again hit northern China during its traditional rainy season, marking the fifth major disaster of its kind in the region since 2012. The storms in late July primarily affected the northern districts of Beijing. This contrasts with previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern parts of the capital. The recurring nature of these destructive floods highlights a concerning trend of extreme weather events impacting the country. This brief explainer clarifies that while the location within the city was different, the event itself is part of an increasingly common pattern.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set to make his home debut in a friendly, having made a promising start on the pitch during the club's preseason tour. However, his first weeks have been overshadowed by significant off-field chaos at the Spanish club.

Furthermore, major delays in the reconstruction of the Nou Camp stadium mean the club's first home league game is also uncertain.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 01:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary piece argues that the world is hurtling toward nuclear catastrophe with a concerning lack of public opposition. The author points to Russia's abandonment of the INF treaty and the frantic nuclear buildup by the U.S. and NATO in Europe as signs of a new, more dangerous arms race. Unlike the massive anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, today's escalation is met with relative silence. The article warns that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as usable for warfare rather than just deterrence, and the collapse of arms control agreements is removing critical safety nets, making the risk of global extinction higher than ever.</p>
