          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially resigned from Congress, further shrinking the Republican's narrow majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on competing with the Chinese Communist Party. His departure brings the Republican majority to 219-212, presenting a significant challenge for House Speaker Mike Johnson as he navigates legislative priorities with very little room for party defections.</p>

          <p>AI computing company CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at approximately $9 billion. The acquisition is a strategic move to strengthen CoreWeave's position in the AI sector by vertically integrating critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity. This deal is expected to eliminate future lease obligations and enhance operational efficiency for CoreWeave. Following the announcement, Core Scientific's stock fell sharply, while CoreWeave's saw a smaller decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is officially appealing a €500 million fine imposed by the European Union, which found the company in violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The European Commission ruled that Apple illegally restricted app developers from informing users about cheaper purchasing options outside the App Store. Apple contends the EU's decision is "unprecedented" and forces business terms that are confusing for developers and harmful to users. This legal battle highlights the ongoing regulatory clash between major tech companies and the EU over market competition and platform control.</p>

          <p>Roman Starovoyt, Russia's former transport minister, was found dead from a reported self-inflicted gunshot wound just hours after being dismissed by President Vladimir Putin. The Investigative Committee is treating suicide as the primary theory behind his death. Starovoyt had been appointed to the post in May of the previous year after serving as governor of the Kursk region. His dismissal and subsequent death occur amid ongoing political turmoil, including the detention of his successor as governor for alleged fraud related to border fortifications.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has begun to outline the platform for his newly announced "America Party," indicating it will be strongly pro-Second Amendment and supportive of Bitcoin. In posts on his social media platform X, Musk affirmed that "The Second Amendment is sacred" and that the party would embrace Bitcoin because "fiat is hopeless." He also endorsed a platform centered on free speech, reduced regulation, fiscal responsibility, and modernizing the military with AI. The move represents Musk's effort to create a new force in American politics, challenging the traditional two-party system.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain high interest rates through July but potentially cut them later in the year, savers are questioning whether now is the right time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). Experts suggest that locking in a CD rate soon could be advantageous, as banks may lower their rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts. However, the decision depends on individual financial situations, including liquidity needs and savings goals. Advisors recommend strategies like CD laddering to balance the benefits of high fixed rates with the need for access to funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix has successfully lured numerous acclaimed directors, such as Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig, away from traditional studios, despite its limited commitment to wide theatrical releases. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its vast global subscriber base of over 300 million. This strategy has made Netflix a haven for auteur filmmakers whose projects may be considered too expensive or risky for conventional studios. By prioritizing subscriber content over box office revenue, Netflix saves on marketing costs while still producing award-contending films.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their personal journey from casually using nonstick pans to an escalating campaign to eliminate plastics from their life due to health concerns. The article delves into the ubiquity of plastics, found in everything from tea bags to human blood, and the associated health risks like organ damage and cancer. Despite the growing awareness and scientific evidence of harm from microplastics and chemicals like PFAS, true avoidance is nearly impossible. The author concludes that while individual actions can help, the problem requires collective responsibility and government action to protect public health.</p>

          <p>A CNBC report, supported by analyses from institutions like the CBO and Wharton School, explores the severe risks associated with the spiraling U.S. national deficit. With the deficit exceeding 6% of GDP, experts like Ray Dalio warn of a potential market crisis, while others point to the threat of sustained inflation and the "crowding out" of private investment. The report highlights that rising interest payments on the debt are projected to surpass defense spending, a historical red flag for declining great powers. Experts estimate the U.S. has less than 20 years to correct its fiscal course. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming EU-China summit is anticipated to yield little strategic progress due to ongoing tensions over the war in Ukraine and trade disputes. Italy’s ambassador to China, Massimo Ambrosetti, expressed a pessimistic view, stating that while dialogue is important, the complex context of tariff negotiations will likely limit significant breakthroughs. The summit, intended to mark the 50th anniversary of EU-China relations, will see European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Antonio Costa travel to Beijing. However, the strained geopolitical environment is expected to overshadow the commemorative occasion.</p>

The report also questions the accuracy of her husband's medical diagnosis and suggests the couple owned property in France.

Although she initially survived the fall, rescue efforts were hampered by difficult terrain and fog, and her body was recovered three days later.

The Dodgers, inspired by her work, have installed a similar tile wall in their clubhouse and included a plaque crediting Bennett as the inspiration.
