          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation held steady at a four-year low of 2.4%, slightly higher than Reuters' prediction of 2.3%.  The article notes that this was unchanged from the previous quarter's rate.  Significant price increases were seen in housing, education, food, and beverages, partially offset by decreases in recreation and culture.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to 4.1% due to this softening inflation.</p>
