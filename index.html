          <p>European politicians are confronting a complex "three-body problem," a metaphor for the profound instability gripping the global order. This chaos is attributed to the United States undermining its established international system, China leveraging its critical mineral monopoly to impact European industry, and Russia's ongoing war at the EU's borders posing significant spillover dangers. This article underscores Europe's urgent quest for a new strategic trajectory amidst these unpredictable challenges, with officials acknowledging the problem's intractability. The continent is focused on developing robust survival mechanisms in this rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape.</p>
