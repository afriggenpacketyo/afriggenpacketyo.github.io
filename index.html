          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Director Ari Aster's new film, "Eddington," is a period piece set in a fictional New Mexico town during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. The movie explores the intense cultural and political polarization of the era, personified by a conflict between the town's mayor, who enforces public health mandates, and a sheriff who advocates for personal freedom. Aster aims to sympathetically portray multiple viewpoints from a deeply divided society, using the escalating tension and eventual violence to critique a landscape where communication and understanding have become nearly impossible.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maryland has become the first state to utilize a fund established under the Affordable Care Act to help cover costs for abortion care, particularly for patients traveling from states with restrictions. The new law allows the state to tap into a multimillion-dollar account, funded by fees from insurance companies, to support nonprofits that assist patients with procedural and travel expenses. This innovative approach addresses the financial strain on abortion providers and funds following the surge in out-of-state patients since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, setting a potential model for other states.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents in Virginia, which hosts the world's highest concentration of data centers, are increasingly opposing new projects due to concerns over massive power and water consumption, as well as constant noise. The surge in AI applications has fueled demand for these facilities, but local activism is growing, with some communities successfully blocking proposed developments. This creates a tension between the economic benefits touted by developers and the quality-of-life and environmental concerns raised by citizens, reflecting a nationwide trend of local resistance to data center expansion.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at a recently opened shopping mall in Kut, Iraq, has resulted in the deaths of at least 60 individuals, with many victims succumbing to suffocation. The blaze, which broke out on Wednesday night, has prompted the regional governor to declare three days of mourning and initiate legal action against the mall's owner. This tragedy highlights the persistent issue of poor safety standards and mismanagement in Iraqi construction, echoing previous fatal incidents like the 2023 wedding hall fire and a 2021 hospital fire. An investigation into the cause is currently underway.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that a significant portion of the German electorate is unimpressed with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's performance since he took office. According to the survey, 32% of voters believe the country has worsened under his leadership, compared to only 22% who see improvement. The article also highlights a study showing that migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers, primarily due to limited access to higher-paying industries rather than unequal pay for the same job, a gap that persists into the second generation.</p>

          <p>China's top anti-corruption body, the CCDI, is intensifying its crackdown on fraud within the science and technology sector. The agency aims to tackle corruption related to the management and allocation of research funds, a key area of risk. Officials stated the goal is to ensure technological development proceeds "in the right direction" by rooting out bribery and the embezzlement of research money. The CCDI plans to leverage high-tech tools like big data and artificial intelligence to enhance its supervisory capabilities and expose complex corruption schemes.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI is facing opposition in Memphis, Tennessee, where civil rights and environmental groups have appealed a permit allowing the company to operate natural-gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer. The NAACP and other groups argue that the Shelby County Health Department improperly issued the permit and ignored residents' concerns about air pollution in nearby majority-Black communities. The appeal claims the turbines, which power the massive data center, violate the Clean Air Act. xAI has dismissed the appeal as "baseless" and "politically driven," maintaining that it complies with all laws.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has withdrawn the party whip from four of its MPs, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party for organizing rebellions against government policy. Three other MPs were also stripped of their unpaid trade envoy roles. This disciplinary action follows significant rebellions over welfare policy and is seen by Downing Street as a move to assert authority and deter future dissent. The move has been described by some within the party as "petty" and "vindictive," revealing tensions within the new government as it seeks to maintain party discipline.</p>

          <p>A weather system moving across the Florida Panhandle is showing an increasing chance of developing into a tropical depression as it heads toward the northern Gulf Coast.

Speaking in Beijing, Huang argued that as technology progresses, it is sensible for the chips available to the Chinese market to improve over time. His comments come after Nvidia resumed sales of its H20 chip, a less powerful model designed to comply with U.S. export controls. The situation highlights the fine line Nvidia walks between adhering to U.S. restrictions and capitalizing on the massive Chinese AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has stated that a key federal grant program for fentanyl overdose prevention, which is currently underfunded, will receive its full allocation but in "increments" rather than a single annual payment. This follows an NPR report on concerns among CDC staff that the $140 million in delayed funds for the Overdose Data To Action (OD2A) program might disappear. While the administration insists the program is not threatened, public health officials express concern that the lack of a clear timeline and contractual commitment makes it difficult to manage programs that rely on this critical funding.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers are expressing frustration that a federal push to modernize equipment and hire more staff overlooks deeper problems plaguing the profession, such as grueling schedules, stagnant pay, and chronic understaffing. While officials are focusing on technology upgrades after recent high-profile incidents, many controllers feel demoralized, arguing these solutions won't fix the immediate quality-of-life issues. They point to mandatory six-day workweeks and fatigue as critical risks to the air travel system, problems that technology alone cannot solve, leading to low morale and burnout among essential personnel.</p>

This new class of warship represents a major advancement in the People's Liberation Army's naval power, enabling more complex and powerful approaches to an adversary's coast.

California's Governor Gavin Newsom and the state's High-Speed Rail Authority have condemned the decision as illegal and politically motivated, vowing to explore all options to fight it.
