          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, resulting in a death toll of over 1,100 people and nearly 3,000 injuries. The quake destroyed approximately 8,000 homes, and officials fear the number of casualties may rise as emergency responders struggle to reach remote villages. This disaster compounds the country's ongoing humanitarian challenges, with the World Health Organization estimating that 12,000 people have been directly affected by the devastating event.</p>

          <p>A writer from Southern Appalachia reflects on the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Helene, a storm that caused catastrophic flooding and cut off communities in Western North Carolina. The article recounts the initial fear and uncertainty, followed by a story of community resilience where private citizens, volunteers, and organizations stepped up to provide aid when government response was perceived as slow. The author highlights the region's ongoing recovery and celebrates the spirit of the Appalachian people in rebuilding their towns and lives after the devastating natural disaster.</p>

His guidance counselor noticed his distress and gently helped him, offering a simple moment of compassion that resonated deeply. Years later, while teaching his own son to tie a tie, Furlong reflected on the profound impact of that kindness, which has inspired his own work as an educator and mentor.</p>

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 election results and remain in power. He and seven allies face charges including plotting a coup and attempting to violently abolish democratic rule, with prosecutors citing extensive evidence from a plea bargain with a former aide. The high-stakes trial is a significant moment for Brazil's democracy and has drawn international attention, including condemnation from former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The article recounts a minor diplomatic incident at the end of World War II, when Canadian Col. Lawrence Cosgrave mistakenly signed on the wrong line of Japan's surrender document. While this briefly risked invalidating the historic agreement, a quick fix resolved the issue. The story explores the context behind the error, noting Cosgrave was a traumatized, one-eyed veteran of WWI, and serves as a reminder to avoid snap judgments about historical figures based on a single mistake.</p>

          <p>Scotland recorded 1,017 drug misuse deaths in 2024, a 13% decrease from the previous year but still the highest rate in Europe for the seventh consecutive year. The crisis is deeply rooted in decades of social and economic challenges, including deindustrialization and poverty, which have contributed to high rates of addiction and so-called "deaths of despair." Experts express concern that the recent emergence of potent synthetic opioids called nitazenes could reverse the recent decline in fatalities, creating a new public health emergency.</p>

          <p>An Indonesian human rights organization, KontraS, reports that at least 20 people are missing following a week of widespread protests across the country. The demonstrations were initially sparked by a government decision to increase housing allowances for lawmakers, a move seen as unjust by the public. The unrest, which has resulted in at least eight deaths and over 1,200 arrests, poses a significant challenge to the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto, who has since revoked the controversial perks.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is emphasizing "delivery" as his government's top priority for the new political term, acknowledging public frustration with the pace of change. He has initiated a shake-up of his Downing Street team to regain control of the political narrative. The move comes as the government increasingly frames its policies in contrast to those of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, which has gained prominence by focusing on issues like asylum and capitalizing on voter impatience.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims India Offered to Eliminate Tariffs on US Goods Amid Trade Dispute</h2>

          <p>Amid a tense trade dispute, U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that India offered to reduce its tariffs on American goods "to nothing." This comment comes after the U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly as a penalty for India's continued purchase of Russian oil. The diplomatic and economic friction is highlighted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, where he met with the leaders of Russia and China.</p>

          <p>Since its launch in mid-July, Tesla has reportedly received just over 600 orders in India, a figure that falls below the company's internal expectations. The electric vehicle manufacturer plans to ship its first batch of 350 to 500 cars from Shanghai to India in early September. The high price of the Model Y, around $70,000 due to steep import tariffs, combined with a lack of charging infrastructure, is seen as a significant hurdle to gaining traction in the price-sensitive Indian market.</p>

          <p>A group of former Premier League players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, claim they lost tens of millions of pounds through investments managed by Kingsbridge Asset Management in the 1990s and 2000s. The players were advised to invest in high-risk, unregulated film financing and property schemes that ultimately failed, leaving them with huge tax liabilities and, in some cases, bankruptcy. Despite being told by police they were "victims of crime," the former footballers are now being pursued by tax authorities for millions.</p>

          <p>The British Beer and Pub Association warns that one pub is projected to close every day in 2025 across Great Britain, threatening thousands of jobs. Pub owners are struggling with a combination of rising operational costs, including increased minimum wage and business rates, and reduced consumer spending. Many have been forced to raise prices, with the average pint of beer now costing over £5, but they are running out of ways to absorb the financial pressure, leading to calls for government intervention.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of steep new U.S. port fees set to be introduced in October, Chinese shipping firms are adjusting their strategies by strengthening global alliances and expanding into regional markets. Companies like Cosco Shipping are focusing on increasing services within Asia and to Africa and Latin America to reduce their exposure to the U.S. market. This strategic shift is a response to changing market dynamics and aims to navigate the financial pressures imposed by the new American trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sport of pickleball is experiencing a surge in popularity in China, with online sales of related equipment increasing more than six-fold over the past year. This growth reflects a broader trend toward active lifestyles in the country, boosted by social media and a renewed interest in racquet sports. While the U.S. craze was driven by community-based courts, China's pickleball boom is more commercial, with for-profit businesses building courts and a national association systemizing its development, creating new business opportunities.</p>

          <p>In response to soaring housing costs, Utah's governor has set a goal of building 35,000 affordable starter homes, but progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 built or started so far. The state has offered low-interest construction loans to incentivize developers, yet many are hesitant, and experts argue that more significant zoning reforms are needed. The article highlights one developer who has embraced the challenge, building and selling new starter homes for under $400,000 to a long waitlist of first-time buyers.</p>
