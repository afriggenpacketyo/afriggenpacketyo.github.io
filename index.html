          <p>A tour bus crash on the westbound 60 Freeway near Azusa Avenue in Hacienda Heights, California, resulted in one fatality and injuries to 32 others. The incident occurred early Sunday morning and involved a bus carrying approximately 63 passengers, requiring a large-scale rescue operation by the LA County Fire and CHP. At least two people sustained critical injuries, and the cause of the collision is currently under investigation. The freeway has since reopened, except for one lane, as authorities continue to examine the circumstances surrounding the crash.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva, with details expected to be released on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated that a deal addressing national security concerns related to China's trade practices has been reached, though it remains unclear if tariffs will be reduced. These talks aim to de-escalate tensions following a trade war initiated by the Trump administration, which has imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing, disrupting global supply chains, and raising concerns about economic slowdown and inflation. This article provides context for the ongoing economic negotiations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and European officials are at odds over food safety standards, particularly regarding American meat production. The US argues that American meat, produced without strict European regulations like hormone bans, is superior and should be more widely accepted in Europe. European officials, however, maintain that their food, health, and safety standards are non-negotiable, citing consumer preference for hormone-free and locally sourced products. This stance is creating a sticking point in trade negotiations, where the US seeks greater access for its agricultural products, while Europe prioritizes its food culture and smaller family farms.</p>

          <p>A perilous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy resulted in the deaths of two young children, aged 3 and 4, and one adult, highlighting the ongoing dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach Europe. The migrants were aboard a frail rubber dinghy that suffered engine failure shortly after departing from western Libya, leaving them adrift for an extended period. The German aid organization RESQSHIP rescued 59 survivors, many of whom suffered critical injuries, including chemical burns from saltwater and fuel. This incident underscores the increasing risks associated with Mediterranean crossings, with nearly 25,000 migrants having died or gone missing since 2014.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a cease-fire after a four-day conflict involving drones, missiles, and shelling, with both countries claiming victory. President Trump announced the cease-fire, attributing it to U.S. mediation, which Pakistan praised. However, India downplayed the American role, framing the negotiations as bilateral and emphasizing its firm stance against terrorism following an attack in Kashmir. Despite the cease-fire, uncertainty remains about its sustainability, as underlying tensions and nationalistic sentiments persist in both countries, potentially leading to future conflicts.</p>
