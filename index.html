          <p>As the Trump-Putin summit approaches in Alaska, the family of David Barnes, an American serving a 21.5-year sentence in Russia, expresses hope for a prisoner exchange. Barnes was convicted of child sexual assault charges in Russia, which Texas prosecutors say were unsubstantiated. His family seeks his designation as wrongfully detained, urging President Trump and Secretary Rubio to prioritize his release. This case highlights the broader context of Americans held abroad and the potential for diplomatic resolutions during high-level meetings.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai faces the final stages of his national security trial, accused of colluding with foreign forces under Beijing's controversial 2020 law. His case, postponed due to a typhoon, has garnered international attention, with calls for his release from figures like UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Critics argue the trial weaponizes Hong Kong's legal system against political opposition, while Lai's family fears he may die in prison given his age and health. The situation underscores ongoing concerns about civil liberties in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Eighty years later, the scars remain from the last US firebombing of Kumagaya, Japan, on August 14-15, 1945, just hours before Japan's surrender. The raid killed at least 260 people and destroyed much of the city. Survivors, like Kazue Hojo and Susumu Fujino, recount the horror and lasting impact, while a Buddhist temple statue bears the marks of the fire. Despite the tragedy, survivors express no animosity towards the US, focusing instead on the senselessness of war and the importance of peace.</p>

          <p>As part of President Trump's plan to address crime, National Guard troops have begun deploying along the National Mall in Washington D.C., aiming for a significant military presence by Thursday morning. This extraordinary move, intended to aid law enforcement with logistics and visibility, is set to create a spectacle for residents and tourists. While the law allows presidential activation for federal property protection or extraordinary crises, the specific intent beyond a show of force remains unclear, with critics questioning its necessity given declining crime rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revoked Joe Biden's 2021 executive order aimed at promoting competition across various US economic sectors, including agriculture, drugs, and labor. The Justice Department welcomed the move, advocating for an "America first antitrust" approach focused on free markets, rather than Biden's "overly prescriptive" methods. Critics argue that Trump's actions, including plans to shrink the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have already cost Americans billions in fees and lost compensation, raising concerns about corporate power and consumer protection.

While some employees keep these plans private, companies generally accept the practice as long as business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated.

The system's design, with MAID-coordination centers and a lack of taboo around seeking multiple assessments, along with widespread public awareness, has significantly propelled demand.
