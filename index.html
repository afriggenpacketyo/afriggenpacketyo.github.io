        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration argued the "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, but the court disagreed with this interpretation. This ruling upholds a lower court's block on the policy, though the White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of Ozzy Osbourne at age 76, this article explores how he and his band, Black Sabbath, pioneered the heavy metal genre. Originating from industrial Birmingham, the band reacted against the "hippy-dippy" music of the late 1960s, creating a heavier, darker sound inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, and the band's occult-themed lyrics defined their influential sound. Their music, from albums like "Paranoid" and "Master of Reality," established a template for countless rock bands and cemented Osbourne's legacy.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers Expresses Preference for Playing Defense</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 21:59:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco Giants player Rafael Devers made a surprising admission following his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more engaged in the game and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had reportedly resisted a move to first base and was assigned to designated hitter duties. Devers' successful debut, which included two hits, contributed to the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber has defended the league's policy banning political signage at games, citing safety concerns and the need to avoid incitement. The comments came in response to fan groups displaying banners protesting against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) amid a federal immigration crackdown. While supporters' groups argue the current political climate makes them feel unsafe, Garber stated the league itself will not take a political stance but individual teams are permitted to do so. This issue has led to protests and boycotts from fan groups in several MLS cities.</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking second-quarter operating profit and revenue, surpassing analyst expectations. This strong performance is attributed to the surging demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in generative AI systems for clients like Nvidia. The company's revenue and operating profit saw significant year-on-year increases of over 35% and 69%, respectively. SK Hynix expects this robust demand to continue, planning to double its HBM sales for the year and increase capital expenditure to maintain its market leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. representatives has introduced a resolution to stop a federal plan to shoot approximately 450,000 barred owls in the Pacific Northwest. The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, aims to protect the threatened northern spotted owl, which is being outcompeted by the more aggressive barred owls. Proponents of the resolution argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, estimating the cost at $1.35 billion. However, some conservationists and scientists warn that halting the plan could lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight subcommittee has voted to subpoena the Justice Department for its complete investigative files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The motion, pushed by Democrats, received bipartisan support with three Republicans joining in the vote, signaling a break from GOP leadership's previous resistance on the matter. The subpoena demands all documents related to the Epstein investigation and was amended to include communications with former and current presidential administrations. The move reflects growing pressure for transparency and accountability in the high-profile case following the DOJ's recent review which claimed no "incriminating client list" was found.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has reached a settlement with the Trump administration, agreeing to pay over $221 million to resolve investigations and restore frozen federal funding. The university will pay $200 million to the federal government and $21 million to settle employment-related inquiries. In exchange, the administration will reinstate $400 million in federal research grants that were withheld over allegations Columbia failed to curb antisemitism on campus during protests. The deal codifies reforms the university had already announced and will be overseen by an independent monitor, marking a significant development in the administration's campaign to reshape higher education.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market remains competitive, there are early signs of a slight shift that could provide more opportunities for homebuyers. According to real estate experts, inventory is increasing, with 34% more sellers than buyers nationally in May, the highest rate since 2013. However, prices are still hitting record highs, driven by a shortage of sellers who are locked into low mortgage rates. Markets vary significantly by location, with some areas in Texas and Florida favoring buyers, while the Northeast remains a strong seller's market, leaving many prospective buyers frustrated by bidding wars.

          <p>Insurance claims from the destructive Eaton wildfire in Los Angeles could potentially exhaust California's $21 billion wildfire fund, according to state officials. The fund was established in 2019 to shield utility companies from bankruptcy if their equipment is found to have caused a wildfire. Investigators are examining whether Southern California Edison's equipment sparked the January blaze, which killed 17 people. With insured loss estimates ranging from $20 billion to $45 billion, the state's Catastrophe Response Council warns the fund's financial health is at risk, prompting a review of strategies to ensure its long-term viability.

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which will study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This research aims to better understand "space weather," a phenomenon that can disrupt and damage critical infrastructure like satellites, GPS signals, and power grids. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing scientists to precisely measure how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission is crucial for developing the ability to predict and mitigate the potentially dangerous effects of solar activity on our technology-dependent society and astronauts in space.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue for the second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of falling sales that missed analysts' estimates. The company's overall revenue was $22.50 billion, slightly below expectations, with net income also falling compared to the previous year. CEO Elon Musk warned of potentially "rough quarters" ahead, citing higher tariff costs and the upcoming expiration of federal EV tax credits. The sales slump is attributed partly to increased competition and backlash against Musk's political activities, though the company is planning a more affordable model for 2025.

Medical charity MSF reports that patient numbers at its clinic for sexual abuse survivors have nearly tripled since 2021, with gangs using mass sexual assault during neighborhood attacks to subjugate the population.

          <p>The United Kingdom's vehicle manufacturing output in the first half of the year has fallen to its lowest point since 1953, not counting the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car production declined by 7.3%, while van production plummeted by 45%. The downturn is attributed to factors like the closure of a major van plant and uncertainty over U.S. tariffs, which caused some firms to slow production. While the production of electric vehicles saw a slight increase, the industry body expressed doubt about meeting long-term government production targets. (not investment advice)</p>
