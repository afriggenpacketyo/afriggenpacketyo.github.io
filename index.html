          <h2>South Korea's Plea for Family Reunions with North Korea Faces Bleak Prospects</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung urged North Korea to allow reunions for families separated by the Korean War, marking the third annual memorial day for separated families. Analysts believe Pyongyang will likely ignore these pleas due to deep distrust and North Korea's strengthened alliances with China and Russia, reducing Seoul's leverage. The North Korean regime may also fear that reunions could foster pro-South sentiment, undermining its propaganda that portrays the South as corrupt. Time is running out for the dwindling number of divided families, with past reunions being rare and recent actions like demolishing a meeting place showing increasing hostility.</p>

          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his "compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art." Known for postmodern works like "Satantango," he expressed happiness and nervousness upon receiving the news in Frankfurt. Krasznahorkai, born in 1954, draws inspiration from his experiences under communism and his travels, with his debut novel being a literary sensation. He is the second Hungarian to win the prestigious award, which will be presented at a ceremony in Stockholm in December.</p>

Deputy Devon Miller found Eeyore in the road, and the dog then guided her to where the woman had fallen nearby. The woman, who was alert and taken to a medical facility, was surprised by the dog's actions, noting he wasn't even her own pet.</p>

While hate crimes against Jewish people fell by 18% outside London, the Met Police separately reported 40% of all religious hate crimes in its area targeted Jewish people. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the unacceptable levels of hate crime, vowing to ensure perpetrators face justice and highlighting increased police patrols at places of worship.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will convene his cabinet to discuss a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal on Thursday, with approval expected for the plan based on President Trump's 20-point proposal. The agreement's first phase involves the release of all remaining hostages, both alive and dead, from Gaza in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon "yellow line" in Gaza, with the 72-hour hostage release window beginning after the Israeli government ratifies the deal.

Furthermore, Ferrari scaled back its 2030 electrification ambitions, now targeting a model lineup of 40% internal combustion engine cars, 40% hybrid, and 20% fully electric vehicles, down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales.

          <p>Since ChatGPT's launch in November 2022, several AI stocks have seen phenomenal growth, with AppLovin, Rigetti Computing, and Palantir Technologies surging over 2,000%. AppLovin, an ad tech company, rose 4,270% by focusing on AI-driven advertising, but faces an SEC inquiry into data practices. Quantum computing firm Rigetti Computing soared 3,220%, driven by hype despite early-stage growth and significant losses. Data analytics company Palantir Technologies experienced a 2,000% increase, enhancing its platform with AI and achieving profitability. However, the article cautions investors about the high valuations of these stocks, suggesting potential for significant downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of National Guard troops are in the Chicago area, awaiting a judge's decision on the legality of their deployment by the Trump administration for an immigration enforcement operation. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, have strongly opposed the deployment, calling it authoritarian and an infringement on state sovereignty. They argue it blurs the line between military and civilian rule and decreases public safety. The "federal protection mission" comes amidst Trump's claims of high crime in Democratic-run cities, despite police statistics showing crime drops. A federal judge previously blocked a similar deployment in Portland, Oregon.</p>

          <p>All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal will now be entitled to free legal advice for their compensation claims, a significant improvement announced by the UK government. This change, responding to recommendations from a public inquiry, aims to address criticisms of slow and inadequate payouts. Over 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, and hundreds more used personal savings to cover phantom shortfalls. The government also committed to a new appeals process for those who accepted fixed, potentially low, payouts under the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, demonstrating an ongoing effort to deliver justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The formal announcement of the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), expected in October, may be delayed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. Experts project a COLA increase of 2.7% to 2.8%, which would raise the average retirement benefit by about $54 per month. While this is higher than the previous year, many beneficiaries still face high prices for necessities. The timing of the announcement depends on the release of third-quarter consumer price index data, which could be postponed if the shutdown persists. Additionally, Medicare Part B premiums, typically deducted from benefits, may also increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Wyoming, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst a controversy over books with sexual content and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who had served the Campbell County library system for 27 years, sued for wrongful termination, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated when officials sided with objectors seeking to remove the books. The county denied the claims, attributing her dismissal to performance issues. Lesley's attorney hopes the settlement sends a message to other library districts about upholding constitutional obligations and fighting discrimination.</p>

          <p>The Gaza ceasefire deal, announced by Donald Trump, represents a significant human moment and a major turning point in the conflict, bringing joy and relief to both Israelis and Palestinians. The agreement is expected to lead to the release of all remaining Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners within days, along with a cessation of fighting and increased aid. However, this is merely a ceasefire, not a peace deal, with formidable challenges remaining regarding Hamas's disarmament, Israel's troop withdrawal, and the establishment of a Palestinian state.

          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates a surprising and statistically significant decline in alcohol consumption among US Republicans, with the percentage of drinkers falling from 65% to 46% in just two years. This trend is more pronounced than among Democrats or independents, prompting various theories including the influence of figures like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, a resurgence of Protestant temperance, or a "Make America healthy again" movement. Young conservatives, in particular, are noted for being more health-conscious, with many abstaining for health reasons or due to a 24/7 news cycle demanding constant attention.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that a high-magnitude earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone could trigger a secondary quake on California’s San Andreas fault, potentially causing widespread devastation across the US west coast. Researchers analyzed deep-sea sediment cores, finding evidence of 18 synchronized earthquakes over the last 3,000 years, often occurring within hours or minutes of each other. The findings suggest these back-to-back events are common, with the most recent connected to a 1700 Cascadia temblor that likely initiated a magnitude 7.9 quake in northern California. Experts emphasize poor preparedness levels but note Cascadia's activity could serve as an early warning for San Andreas.</p>

          <p>Advocates are urgently appealing to halt the execution of Robert Roberson in Texas, who was convicted in a "shaken baby syndrome" case, a medical diagnosis now widely disputed as junk science. Roberson's legal team presents new evidence, including expert testimony from 10 pathologists challenging the 2002 autopsy findings, suggesting his daughter's death was due to infection and an accidental fall. His autism diagnosis, undiagnosed at trial, is also cited to explain his demeanor. This article highlights the grave concerns about wrongful execution based on unreliable scientific evidence, especially given previous exonerations in similar cases.</p>
