          <p>Ian Wilkinson, the sole survivor of a toxic mushroom lunch, testified in the trial of Erin Patterson, who is charged with the murder of three relatives and the attempted murder of Wilkinson himself.

Other evidence presented included Facebook group posts where Patterson discussed using powdered mushrooms in her cooking and sought advice on preparing beef Wellington, the dish served at the fateful lunch. </p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang. This claim was used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's operations in the U.S. The release of this memo further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and calls into question its criticism of news coverage on the issue. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has declared a communitywide outbreak of hepatitis A, with cases tripling since last year and reaching the highest levels in a decade.

Health officials are urging people to get vaccinated against the disease, which can lead to lasting liver damage or death. Wastewater data also indicates that the outbreak is larger than reported, and officials are concerned about potential federal budget cuts affecting their ability to respond. </p>

          <p>A study led by Peking University has found that migratory pests from Southeast Asia, thriving under El NiÃ±o conditions, are contributing to rice yield losses in southern China. Warm, humid weather in the pest source region, combined with wind gusts, facilitates the migration of these pests. Researchers emphasize the need for collaborative, international pest control strategies to ensure food security in the region. The team notes that continued global warming will further alter pest habitats and increase crop pest occurrences, posing a major obstacle to stabilizing food production. </p>

          <p>President Trump is promoting a dinner open to those who purchase enough of his meme coin, which has generated over $320 million in fees for its creators. This arrangement allows the Trump family to monetize access to the president. The meme coin's value jumped after the dinner announcement, and creators profit from trading fees within the liquidity pool. Critics argue this mixes politics with personal finances, allowing bad actors to influence the president. The remaining coins are allocated to CIC Digital and another company, with an ethics agreement limiting Trump's direct involvement. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is offering undocumented immigrants $1,000 to leave the U.S. as part of its latest immigration crackdown, drawing criticism for suggesting that participation in the program "may help preserve the option" for an individual to re-enter the U.S. "legally in the future". The White House said it was "exploring all options" on protecting the US film industry, a day after Donald Trump triggered a drop in production company shares by announcing a 10% tariff on movies produced outside the US.</p>

          <p>Three people died and nine others are missing, including two children, after a small boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, California, in what authorities suspect was a migrant smuggling attempt. The incident occurred about 30 miles north of the US-Mexico border, with rough ocean conditions reported at the time. At least some of the boat's occupants were apparently from India, as Indian passports were found on the beach. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by maritime smuggling. </p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a whistleblower attorney, is suing the Trump administration to restore his security clearance, claiming it was revoked for "improper political retribution." Zaid, who has represented whistleblowers across administrations, argues the revocation undermines his ability to represent his clients effectively. The complaint alleges the revocation violates First and Fifth Amendment rights and requests the court to declare the presidential memorandum unconstitutional. Attorneys for Zaid suspect he came onto President Trump's radar after representing a whistleblower in 2019 who filed a complaint about Trump's phone call with the Ukrainian President. </p>
