          <h2>Trump Downplays Reports of Plans to Fire Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 14:46:31 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, just hours after reports emerged that he had sought support from Republican lawmakers to do so. The conflicting statements created market volatility, highlighting the administration's ongoing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. The controversy also brings to light legal questions about whether a president has the authority to remove a Fed chair over policy disagreements, an unprecedented move that could undermine the central bank's independence and stability.</p>

          <p>During a recent episode of Michelle Obama's podcast, she and former President Barack Obama humorously dismissed persistent rumors about their marriage being in trouble. Joined by her brother, they joked about the speculation that arises whenever they are not seen in public together. Michelle Obama reaffirmed their strong bond, stating there has never been a moment she considered leaving him. This appearance follows her previous comments explaining that her occasional absence from public events was a personal choice for her well-being, not a sign of marital strife.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has called for an aggressive investigation into the killing of Sayfollah Musallat, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American, who was reportedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers. The incident occurred in the occupied West Bank, where Musallat was visiting family. Huckabee, a known supporter of Israeli settlements, described the killing as a "criminal and terrorist act." The family of the victim is demanding accountability and a separate investigation by the U.S. State Department.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, is on trial for the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who he allegedly killed by lacing her protein shakes with cyanide. Prosecutors argue he was motivated by financial troubles and an affair, citing his online search history for undetectable poisons as key evidence. The defense does not dispute the presence of poison or the affair but suggests Angela may have died by suicide. The case also includes additional charges against Craig for allegedly trying to orchestrate a cover-up from jail, including soliciting the murder of the lead investigator.</p>

          <p>New York State officials are demanding that Tesla rescind a new corporate bylaw that severely restricts shareholders' ability to file derivative lawsuits against the company. After moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas, Tesla enacted a rule requiring an investor to own a 3% stake, currently worth about $30 billion, to bring such a suit. Officials from the New York State Common Retirement Fund called this a "bait-and-switch," arguing Tesla had assured them shareholder rights would be equivalent in Texas. They contend the change effectively insulates Tesla's leadership from accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering a controversial $9 billion spending cut package requested by President Trump, targeting foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting. The measure narrowly advanced after a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, revealing deep divisions even within the Republican party. Senators opposing the cuts have raised concerns about slashing funds for programs like USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. Because the Senate is considering amendments, the bill must return to the House for final approval before a tight deadline.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times review examines two productions at the Theatricum Botanicum, which ambitiously reset classic European plays in American settings. Ellen Geer's adaptation of Chekhov's "The Seagull" relocates the story to 1970s Malibu, capturing the groovy, self-absorbed "Me Generation" with infectious energy, though the final act is noted as a disappointment. John Galsworthy's 1909 labor drama "Strife" is transferred to 1890s Pennsylvania, offering a resonant look at a capital-labor deadlock, though the acting is sometimes overly broad. The review praises the company's vision in reviving the seldom-seen Galsworthy play.</p>

          <p>The 2025 MLB All-Star Game in Atlanta paid a memorable tribute to the late Hank Aaron, recreating his historic 715th home run, which broke Babe Ruth's record in 1974. Using video, audio clips from the original broadcast, and modern lighting technology, the event traced the trajectory of the ball and Aaron's path around the bases. The tribute celebrated not only a monumental baseball achievement but also a significant moment for civil rights, as a Black man received a standing ovation in the Deep South for surpassing a beloved icon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a podcast from The Atlantic, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok warns that the bureau is being systematically dismantled during President Trump's second term. Strzok argues that Trump loyalists in leadership are purging experienced personnel, sidelining critical investigations, and prioritizing political agendas over national security. He expresses grave concern that this hollowing out of expertise and resources, particularly in counterterrorism and counterintelligence, is leaving the United States dangerously vulnerable to foreign threats and attacks. The discussion also touches on the political fracture within the MAGA movement over the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Inflation in the United Kingdom has accelerated more quickly than expected, complicating the Bank of England's plans for an anticipated interest rate cut in August. The surprise bounce in inflation, which is now expected to remain well above the 2% target until the autumn, has created renewed caution among investors and economists. While a rate cut is still anticipated later in the year, the Bank will now face tougher questions about whether the UK is uniquely prone to inflation and must justify its policy decisions amid a weakening jobs market.</p>

However, Hamas and witnesses at a local hospital dispute this, claiming the crush was caused by security contractors closing gates and firing tear gas into the desperate crowd.

This finding had intensified scrutiny on the safety of the switch mechanisms on several Boeing models, leading to similar inspection orders in other countries like South Korea.</p>
