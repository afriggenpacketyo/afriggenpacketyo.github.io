          <p>President Trump publicly pressured Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a strong jobs report indicating a resilient economy. Trump argued that such a cut would provide "rocket fuel" for the economy, echoing his frequent calls for lower rates to stimulate growth. However, markets anticipate little chance of a rate decrease following the Federal Open Market Committee's upcoming meeting. The president also reiterated his concerns that other global central banks have been cutting rates while the Fed has remained stagnant, potentially putting the U.S. at a disadvantage.

          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has evolved from a feud to a close alliance, then back to animosity. Musk initially criticized Trump in 2016 but later joined his administration to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. However, Musk left the administration and publicly criticized Trump's policies, leading to a public spat involving accusations and threats. The conflict escalated with Musk alleging Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein case and Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts.</p>

President Trump's budget bill is cutting $1 billion from SAMHSA's budget, and its mission is being integrated into a new entity under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Lawmakers and healthcare providers are expressing concern about the impact on mental health and addiction services, particularly in rural communities that rely on SAMHSA grants for support.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is poised to significantly impact entry-level positions in white-collar sectors, potentially reducing or reshaping these roles, according to experts. The rise of AI-fueled chatbots and automation is leading some companies to cut staff and prioritize AI integration. While economic conditions and trade policies contribute to current job market challenges for recent graduates, AI's capacity to perform written and computational tasks poses a threat to tasks traditionally handled by entry-level employees. Experts suggest that the career ladder may be disrupted, but tech-savvy young workers could be well-positioned to adapt to new AI-integrated jobs.</p>

The CDC recommends using distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation to prevent infection. PAM is typically associated with recreational water activities in warm freshwater, where the amoeba can enter the brain through the nose.</p>

          <p>Air quality conditions are improving across the United States as smoke from Canadian wildfires diminishes after prompting air quality alerts earlier in the week. The Air Quality Index indicates primarily moderate air quality in the Midwest and Northeast, with some areas still facing unhealthy air for sensitive groups. While some air quality alerts remain in effect, the smoke is becoming less intense. Over 200 fires continue to burn in Canada, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.</p>

          <p>Financial regulators are cracking down on "finfluencers" who provide unauthorized financial advice on social media, resulting in arrests and the removal of hundreds of posts and websites. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is leading an international effort to address illegal financial promotions, often packaged as lavish lifestyle endorsements. The crackdown aims to protect consumers from misleading or harmful financial advice. The FCA is also considering lifting the ban on offering crypto exchange traded notes to retail investors.
