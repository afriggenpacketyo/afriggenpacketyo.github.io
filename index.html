            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-10 22:21:03 EDT</div>
          </div>

            <p>The Supreme Court unanimously instructed the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to a high-security prison in El Salvador. While acknowledging the government's obligation to assist in his return, the court directed a lower court to clarify the extent to which the administration can be compelled to 'effectuate' his return, respecting executive branch authority in foreign affairs. The ruling comes amidst ongoing debates about immigration enforcement and due process, with implications for the administration's deportation policies. The Justice Department maintained that the President has the exclusive prerogative to conduct foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>North Carolina lawmakers have passed a bill to prevent discrimination in emergency aid distribution based on political affiliation or speech. This legislation was prompted by allegations that a FEMA supervisor instructed workers to avoid homeowners displaying Trump signs after Hurricane Helene. The former supervisor claimed she was following orders from superiors to avoid potentially hostile political encounters. The bill aims to ensure equitable access to state emergency assistance regardless of political views, amending the North Carolina Emergency Management Act and moving on to the Senate.</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil are challenging the government's attempt to deport him, arguing there's no evidence his presence poses a foreign policy threat. The government presented a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio asserting Khalil's alleged role in 'antisemitic protests' justifies deportation, even for otherwise lawful actions. Khalil's attorneys criticize the memo as an attack on First Amendment rights and plan to depose Rubio. The case could set a precedent for silencing critics and removing them from the country.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, but stopped short of demanding his immediate return. The court's unsigned order stated that Garcia's removal was 'illegal.' Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson reaffirmed due process rights for migrants in U.S. custody. Garcia's attorney stated that the rule of law prevailed.</p>

The market downturn was triggered by China's countermeasures and clarification that the U.S. will tax Chinese imports at 145%. Despite positive inflation data, uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade policies continues to fuel market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.4% in March, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation, but experts caution that inflationary risks remain a threat to the U.S. economy. The CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month, reaching a new record-high of $6.23. Despite easing inflation, experts suggest that the Federal Reserve is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to affect the inflation data.

The court ruled that Sony can begin distributing the shows and does not need to deliver episodes to CBS. CBS Media Ventures said that it would immediately appeal the court's ruling.</p>
