          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, retaliating for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Explosions were reported in Qatar, with missiles intercepted by Qatari air defenses, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it "Annunciation of Victory." The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, while the U.S. confirmed the attack, stating that there were no reported U.S. casualties at the time. U.S. officials had met with Qatari officials to prepare for the expected retaliation, and lawmakers are scheduled to receive classified briefings on Iran and the U.S. military response. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing tensions and potential for further escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>A report from Third Way indicates that proposed health-care cuts in the Republican budget bill could increase medical debt for some families by as much as $22,800. The bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage, potentially causing millions to lose health insurance. This loss of coverage would increase the number of people in families with medical debt, with overall medical debt rising by $50 billion. While the White House claims the cuts aim to eliminate waste, critics argue they will harm families and undermine the American Dream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran executed a missile strike targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

President Trump stated that the strikes caused "Monumental Damage" to Iranian nuclear sites, although a full assessment is pending.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as no casualties were reported, raising hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil futures fell significantly, and the global benchmark Brent also decreased. The strike was in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, and Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the missiles without causing casualties.

          <p>Iran retaliated against U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities by launching missile strikes against a major U.S. base in Qatar, leading to explosions and the interception of missiles by Qatari air defenses.

While Iran reportedly coordinated the strikes to minimize casualties, the attack marks a significant escalation in the conflict. General Joseph Votel suggests the attack might be a signal that Iran had to respond but is ready to de-escalate.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are advised to carefully consider their options regarding home equity loans this summer, understanding the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC. A home equity loan disburses the equity in a single lump sum with a fixed interest rate, while a HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates. Shopping around for rates and terms is crucial, and homeowners should use the equity for financially sound purposes rather than frivolous expenses. Using home equity wisely can improve financial standing, but poor decisions can worsen it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly struck Tehran's Evin prison, which houses political detainees, and damaged parts of the facility, according to Iran's judiciary. The situation is reportedly "under control," though state TV footage showed first responders attending to casualties. The Israeli military also claimed to have struck access routes to the Fordo uranium enrichment plant. France condemned the strike on Evin prison, citing the endangerment of French citizens held there. Amnesty International expressed distress over the reports, emphasizing that deliberately attacking civilian objects is a war crime.</p>
