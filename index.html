        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following days of intense, youth-led anti-corruption protests that led to the previous government's collapse, Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, has seen a return to calm. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki has been sworn in as the nation's first female interim prime minister. The appointment, which followed negotiations involving the army and protest representatives, is seen as a stabilizing move. In response to the unrest, which was fueled by economic woes and a controversial social media ban, the parliament has been dissolved and new elections are scheduled for March 5.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant political pressure after it was revealed that officials knew of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Starmer publicly defended him. Although sources say the Prime Minister himself was unaware of the email contents at the time, the revelation has led to Mandelson's dismissal as the UK's ambassador to the US. The controversy has intensified scrutiny of the vetting process for the appointment and has created a challenging situation for Starmer's leadership, with some Labour MPs expressing serious concerns.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both a declining birth rate and a need to strengthen its scientific workforce, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to support women returning to work after childbirth. Initially targeting 20 new mothers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program is for women under 40 with a doctoral degree. While the initial scope is limited, it is being viewed by some as a positive step toward supporting women in demanding scientific careers.</p>

The couple, aged 80 and 76, were arrested in February and have been held without charge, with their health rapidly declining due to harsh conditions and lack of adequate medical care. The United Nations has called their detention inhumane, and the former detainee is pleading with the US and UK governments to secure their release before it is too late. The Foreign Office has stated it is supporting the family.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identities while on duty. The measure is a direct response to recent immigration raids in which federal agents covered their faces, causing fear and confusion in communities. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for public trust and accountability, while law enforcement groups and Republican lawmakers contend it would endanger officers. The bill, which includes exceptions for undercover work and tactical gear, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

          <p>Tensions across Europe have escalated significantly after more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting a robust response from NATO. Allies including Denmark, France, and Germany are deploying additional fighter jets and troops to bolster the alliance's eastern flank. Poland described the incursion as deliberate and the most serious incident of its kind since the Ukraine war began, with its prime minister stating it was "the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." Moscow has downplayed the event, but the US has affirmed it will defend every inch of NATO territory.</p>

          <p>This commentary explores the possibility of Cristiano Ronaldo returning to play in the United States after a long absence, suggesting the move is strategically timed with the upcoming World Cup and a more favorable political environment under Donald Trump. The article posits that Ronaldo's 12-year avoidance of the U.S. is linked to vehemently denied sexual assault allegations from 2009, which created a risk of legal action and negative publicity. A return, potentially for a friendly match, could serve as a test of public reception and a powerful branding opportunity for both Ronaldo and FIFA ahead of the tournament.</p>

Villagers have received compensation for lost property but now face a diminished livelihood and the depressing reality of living next to the wall.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a frustrating 5-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, ending on a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning. The defeat squandered an exceptional outing by pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who allowed only one run over seven innings while striking out ten. The Dodgers' offense was anemic, managing just one run and failing to capitalize on scoring opportunities. The loss was sealed by another blown save from closer Tanner Scott, halting the team's recent winning streak and reigniting concerns about their inconsistent late-game performance.</p>
