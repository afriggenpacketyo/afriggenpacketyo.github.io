          <h2>Comcast Exceeds Earnings Projections Despite Broadband Customer Losses</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comcast reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, even with a decline in broadband subscribers due to increased competition from alternative internet providers like 5G. The company's mobile business, however, showed strong growth, adding 323,000 lines. Comcast experienced losses in cable TV customers as the traditional bundle continues to decline. Peacock, Comcast's streaming platform, narrowed its quarterly loss and increased paid subscribers, while theme park revenue decreased due to lower attendance, partially attributed to Los Angeles wildfires.</p>

          <p>The United States has escalated its military involvement in Yemen with a campaign of airstrikes against the Houthi rebels, known as Operation Rough Rider, in response to their attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The strikes have targeted Houthi command centers and weapons facilities, resulting in significant casualties. Despite the damage inflicted, analysts caution that air strikes alone may not be sufficient to defeat the Houthis. The US aims to halt Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, but the group has vowed to continue fighting, raising concerns about a prolonged conflict and resource strain.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that significantly favors Russia, demanding Ukraine cede territory seized during the war and abandon NATO aspirations. Vice President JD Vance indicated the US would withdraw from peace talks if Ukraine does not accept these terms. President Trump echoed this sentiment, suggesting Ukraine could lose the entire country if it continues fighting.

          <p>Microsoft has unveiled a new "1-bit" AI model that is small enough to run on a CPU and uses just 0.4 GB of memory, matching the performance of larger AI models. This breakthrough could shift the AI landscape, reducing the reliance on costly AI accelerators and data centers. The new model can produce output at a speed comparable to human reading, making it useful for PCs and smartphones. This development could benefit Intel and AMD, as it allows for more efficient on-device AI processing.</p>

          <p>Armed groups caused widespread disruption across Mexico by torching vehicles and blocking roads, as a turf war escalates between the Jalisco New Generation cartel and local criminal organizations. The attacks, primarily in Michoacan and Guanajuato, are believed to be a response to military operations targeting the Jalisco cartel. While the fires have been contained and roads cleared, the incident underscores the ongoing violence and instability caused by drug trafficking groups in Mexico. The Jalisco New Generation cartel was designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in February.</p>

          <p>The author argues that economic nostalgia, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trump-era tariffs, leads to detrimental policies. Both instances involved romanticizing a past era and blaming foreign competition for economic woes. The author asserts that such protectionist measures ultimately undermine the economies they aim to protect, hindering progress and causing economic harm. The contributor says that economic nostalgia is a poor guide to sound policy, and prosperity comes from embracing change, not resisting it.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren is launching an investigation into the Trump administration's efforts to close the Department of Education. Warren is seeking input from students, parents, teachers, and civil rights groups to understand the potential impact of these cuts. Warren said that the cuts to the Education Department will have “dire consequences” for the country's more than 40 million student loan borrowers.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering plans to introduce regional energy pricing, potentially giving discounts to homes near energy infrastructure. Energy secretary Ed Miliband confirmed that the government was looking to shake-up the energy market, which he said could involve "zonal pricing and reformed national pricing". The scheme is supported by some energy businesses, but critics argue that it could result in millions of Britons paying more for their energy.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Finalizes Rules for Tech Firms to Protect Children Online</h2>

          <p>Ofcom, the UK media regulator, has finalized rules for tech firms to protect children online. The "Children's Codes" require companies to overhaul algorithms and age checks to prevent children from accessing harmful content, such as pornography and material promoting self-harm. Companies that fail to comply face significant fines. While Ofcom views the rules as a "gamechanger," critics argue that they do not go far enough.</p>
