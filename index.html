        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadcom's second-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by robust revenue and strong guidance for the upcoming period. The chipmaker reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 against an expected $1.56, with revenue reaching $15 billion, slightly above the $14.99 billion projection. Broadcom anticipates approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, exceeding the analysts' forecast of $15.70 billion. The company's net income saw a substantial increase to $4.97 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.12 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the previous year, fueled by AI revenue which reached $4.4 billion. Broadcom expects continued AI growth through fiscal year 2026, with projected AI chip sales of $5.1 billion in the third quarter. The strong performance is attributed to Broadcom's custom AI chips and networking parts for server clusters.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk declared that SpaceX would immediately begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft following President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts with Musk's enterprises. This announcement stemmed from escalating tensions between Musk and Trump after Musk criticized Trump's tax bill. Dragon is the only U.S. spacecraft capable of transporting crew to and from the International Space Station. NASA officials stated they would continue to work with industry partners to fulfill the President's vision for space exploration. SpaceX has been developing its Starship rocket as a potential replacement for Dragon, although testing has faced setbacks with multiple explosions during launches.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a sharp decline as the public dispute between Elon Musk and President Trump intensified, with Trump suggesting the revocation of federal contracts for Musk's companies. Tesla shares fell by as much as 18% during intraday trading before closing down 14.3%, erasing approximately $151 billion from the company's market value. The conflict arose from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill, which Musk described as a "disgusting abomination." Trump responded by suggesting the government could save money by terminating contracts with Musk's companies, including SpaceX. The public spat has created concern among Tesla investors, as the relationship between Musk and Trump deteriorates.</p>

          <p>According to David Brooks, the Democratic Party is struggling to adapt to the current political climate, characterized by widespread social distrust and a belief that societal systems are rigged. Brooks argues that the Republicans have been more successful in adjusting to this shift, exemplified by Donald Trump's populist message. He suggests that the Democrats' problems are deeper than just needing a new message or leader, requiring a fundamental shift in worldview. The populist movement, driven by distrust in elites, has reshaped the political landscape, and Democrats must adapt to this new reality to remain relevant.</p>

Quintana, who pleaded not guilty, faces a decade in prison for allegedly promoting events that led to dangerous situations, including one where a spectator died. Prosecutors argue that Quintana is responsible for bringing together street racers and spectators, contributing to the crimes committed at these events.

          <p>NATO defense ministers indicated broad support for a historic increase in defense spending in response to the growing threat from Russia.

The plan includes allocating 3.5% of GDP to core defense spending and 1.5% to defense- and security-related investment. While most NATO countries currently meet the 2% spending threshold, achieving the 5% goal would require significant financial commitment, particularly amid economic challenges in Europe.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares tumbled 20% after the company reduced its full-year earnings guidance, citing a "dynamic macroenvironment." Despite beating Wall Street's expectations for fiscal first-quarter earnings, the company lowered its full-year earnings per share forecast to between $14.58 and $14.78. The report comes amid concerns about tariffs and a slowing U.S. economy. Lululemon's report follows similar actions from other retailers who have reduced or withdrawn guidance due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff regime. (not investment advice)</p>
