          <p>China's universities are grappling with a STEM education crisis, as critics argue that outdated courses prioritize theory over practical experience, failing to prepare students for real-world employment. Robotics guru Wang Xingxing highlighted that Chinese graduates often learn 20-year-old material, contrasting with cutting-edge technologies taught overseas. Educators fear this disconnect hinders China's ability to nurture bright minds crucial for the "fourth industrial revolution" driven by AI, quantum computing, and new energy. The article emphasizes the urgent need for educational reform to align with industrial demands and global technological advancements.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee man, Byron Black, executed by lethal injection, reportedly exhibited "sustained cardiac activity" for nearly two minutes after being declared dead, according to his attorney Kelley Henry. This revelation, based on EKG records, intensifies scrutiny on Tennessee's capital punishment protocols, which were previously criticized for causing Black visible distress and pain. Henry argued that the pentobarbital sedative likely failed, potentially constituting cruel and unusual punishment and violating the right of witnesses to observe the entire procedure. The article details the profound legal and ethical concerns surrounding the execution, especially given Black's intellectual disabilities and severe health conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, provoked by an Ontario-sponsored advertisement featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump publicly denounced the ad as "FAKE" and misleading, claiming it distorted Reagan's actual stance on tariffs. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation also expressed concerns, stating the ad used edited remarks without authorization. Ontario Premier Doug Ford defended the commercial, which quoted Reagan saying trade barriers "hurt every American worker and consumer," and reaffirmed the strong ties between the two nations.

Reagan's overall message championed free trade, warning that high tariffs inevitably lead to economic downturns and trade wars.

          <p>The U.S. has been conducting intermittent strikes on vessels suspected of drug smuggling in international waters off South American coastlines since early September, with at least 10 publicly disclosed operations.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of "murder," alleging one strike killed a fisherman.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is actively working towards the rapid deployment of an international peacekeeping force in Gaza, a critical element of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. This force is intended to stabilize the fragile truce and address the severe humanitarian crisis. Several countries have offered troops, but Israel maintains approval rights, reportedly rejecting Turkish participation. The article highlights discussions for UN sponsorship to facilitate troop deployment and the formation of a temporary Palestinian committee to manage Gaza's services. While Hamas has renounced governing ambitions, its reluctance to disarm remains a point of concern for the lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, his wife, son, and Interior Minister, accusing them of involvement in the global drug trade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated Petro "has allowed drug cartels to flourish," prompting President Trump to take "strong action." This move significantly escalates tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, particularly following U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats. Petro has denied the allegations and vowed to defend himself judicially in U.S. courts. The article highlights the severe diplomatic fallout and the U.S.'s aggressive stance in its war on drugs.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis of a brain aneurysm in a teaser for "The Kardashians," attributing it to stress. Doctors, however, clarify that while stress doesn't directly cause aneurysms, it can elevate blood pressure, a factor in their formation and growth. Dr. Brian Snelling emphasized genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age as primary culprits. Most aneurysms are small and often discovered incidentally, posing no serious threat unless they rupture. The article underscores the importance of controlling blood pressure and avoiding smoking for prevention, while noting the diagnosis can raise awareness for women's health.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to issue a landmark ruling on the President's authority to deploy troops in U.S. cities, potentially overriding objections from local and state officials. This critical decision follows the Trump administration's appeal against lower court injunctions in Chicago and Portland that blocked National Guard deployments, asserting the President's exclusive discretion in such matters. Democratic leaders and legal scholars, including California's Attorney General and Governor, have warned that an expansive interpretation of presidential power could fundamentally alter the military's role in American society, transforming it into a "personal police force." This article underscores a significant constitutional debate with far-reaching implications for federalism and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>Six men have been jailed in London for a Russian-ordered arson attack on a warehouse providing aid to Ukraine, causing £1.3 million in damage. Ringleader Dylan Earl, recruited by the Wagner Group, a proscribed Russian terrorist organization, received a 17-year sentence. This case marks the first convictions under the UK's National Security Act 2023, designed to counter threats from hostile states. The targeted warehouse was used to send Starlink terminals and other goods to Ukraine. The judge described the incident as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage" in the interests of the Russian state.</p>

          <p>Millions of Russian private investors are trapped, unable to access securities frozen in European depositories like Euroclear and Clearstream, as the EU debates using broader Russian assets for Ukrainian war reparations. These investors, many not on sanctions lists, face immense legal hurdles and costs to reclaim their assets, often exceeding the frozen amounts. Zhanna Nemzova highlights that the current process disproportionately affects ordinary individuals, proposing an inventory of frozen private assets and a simplified recovery procedure.

          <p>The U.S. and Canada are embroiled in a continued dispute over an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan, which led President Trump to terminate trade negotiations. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who sponsored the ad, initially planned to air it during the World Series but later paused the campaign to facilitate the resumption of trade talks. Trump strongly criticized the ad as "fraudulent" and "fake," with the Reagan Foundation also questioning its use of edited remarks. The article highlights the diplomatic tensions, upcoming legal challenges to Trump's tariff authority, and Canada's strategic decision to diversify its exports away from the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>The East Wing of the White House has been entirely demolished to make way for President Trump’s planned $300 million gilded ballroom, contradicting his earlier promise that existing structures would remain untouched. Satellite images confirmed the destruction, sparking outrage among historians and the public. The administration proceeded without initial approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, though officials stated plans would be submitted later. A Virginia couple filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, arguing the construction bypasses legally required historic preservation reviews.

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, known as "Brother Wang," an accused fentanyl kingpin, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States, with Mexico facilitating the transfer. Zhang, who escaped house arrest in Mexico in July, faces charges of international drug trafficking, money laundering, and alliances with criminal groups. U.S. authorities allege he ran a vast operation, coordinating fentanyl and cocaine importation from Mexico and laundering over $20 million. This extradition marks a significant success in the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Mexico and China on drug trafficking, particularly fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid responsible for numerous U.S. overdoses.</p>
