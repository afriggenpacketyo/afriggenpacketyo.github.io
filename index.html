            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported to El Salvador, while clarifying the scope of the lower court's order.

The Supreme Court directed the administration to share information on steps taken for his return, balancing judicial authority with executive branch deference in foreign affairs. The ruling is a rebuke to the administration's focus on deporting alleged gang members.</p>

            <p>Schools in Beirut's southern suburb are fearing a return to war after recent Israeli strikes, which targeted a Hezbollah facility and caused panic among residents. Parents rushed to collect their children from schools, while residents fled the area. The strikes, the first on Dahieh since a ceasefire, have heightened anxieties despite ongoing efforts to maintain normalcy. Schools have implemented evacuation plans and drills to prepare for potential future bombings.</p>

            <p>A general strike in Argentina has severely disrupted transport, with domestic flights cancelled and trains and metro services suspended. The strike is a protest against public spending cuts implemented by President Javier Milei to tackle hyperinflation. Unions argue that vulnerable populations, including pensioners and low-paid workers, have been disproportionately affected. Milei's austerity measures include slashing subsidies, firing public servants, and closing government departments.</p>
