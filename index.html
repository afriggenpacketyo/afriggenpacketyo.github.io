            <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a 49% tariff on Cambodian goods, intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., is unlikely to achieve its goal, according to trade groups. While the tariffs pose an existential threat to Cambodian factories and workers, manufacturers are exploring alternative locations like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. Uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has led to a pause in new orders, as companies await further developments. The Cambodian government is considering fiscal policies, including tax credits, to mitigate the impact of the tariffs.</p>

Some victims have received payouts as low as $324.58, while their local governments have received hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States possesses a considerable advantage over China in the ongoing trade war, emphasizing that China has more to lose. He noted that the U.S. exports significantly less to China than it imports, giving the U.S. more leverage in tariff negotiations. Bessent highlighted that the administration's goal is to bring trading partners to the negotiating table, create jobs in the U.S., and generate revenue through tariffs. While many countries have expressed interest in negotiations, China has vowed to resist further tariff increases.</p>
