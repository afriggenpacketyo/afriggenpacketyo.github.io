          <p>President Trump is attending the NATO summit in The Hague amidst a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran, following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and retaliatory strikes on a US base in Qatar. Trump questioned NATO's Article 5 commitment to collective defense, emphasizing his personal relationships with leaders instead. He also aims to increase defense spending among NATO members to 5% of GDP, a contentious issue with some nations like Spain. The summit takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, with limited involvement expected from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Trump's "America First" policy and its impact on international alliances will be closely watched by world leaders. Optimism surrounding the situation is muted, considering the recent exchanges of fire and the uncertainty of Trump's commitment to NATO.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after President Trump announced that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran, signaling a potential easing of the US pressure campaign following a ceasefire with Israel. Brent crude fell by 4.66% to $68.15 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 4.64% to $65.33 a barrel. This decision reverses previous threats to penalize any country buying Iranian oil and comes as investors believe the risk of major supply disruptions in the Middle East is decreasing. The market had previously seen prices rise when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, fearing retaliation that could disrupt oil exports.</p>

          <p>Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized President Trump's missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, arguing that US involvement in foreign conflicts wastes resources. However, many of her constituents expressed satisfaction with the president's decision, citing the need to protect Israel and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Some voters acknowledged potential consequences but viewed the action as necessary, driven by religious beliefs and a desire to protect God's people. Despite Greene's criticism, her constituents largely remain loyal to Trump and his decisions, highlighting the complex interplay of politics, religion, and national security in their views.</p>

His cautious approach contrasts with President Trump's criticism and calls for lower interest rates. Powell's remarks will be delivered to congressional committees this week, where he is expected to face questions about the Fed's monetary policy and its response to economic uncertainties.

While the US targeted nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, reports suggest the uranium was moved elsewhere. Vance claimed the bombing achieved "mission success" by eliminating Iran's capacity to convert the stockpile into weapons-grade uranium. However, former UN nuclear weapons inspector David Albright noted that unaccounted-for centrifuges remain a concern.</p>

Women typically receive slightly lower monthly payments due to longer life expectancies, while joint life annuities offer continued payments to a surviving spouse but with reduced monthly amounts. Annuity payouts are also influenced by current interest rates, with higher rates generally translating into stronger payouts.
