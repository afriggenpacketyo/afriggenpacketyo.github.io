          <p>During a Pirates-Cubs game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, a fan named Kavan Markwood fell from the right-field bleachers onto the warning track, sustaining critical injuries. The incident occurred moments after an RBI double by Andrew McCutchen, causing a brief delay in the game. Markwood, a 2022 high school graduate, was immediately attended to by trainers, police, and EMS before being transported to the hospital. Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the incident as accidental, and the Pirates organization expressed their thoughts and prayers for Markwood and his family, with McCutchen also sharing his concern on social media.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal messaging app during a Cabinet meeting, just a day before President Trump announced his replacement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The photo revealed conversations with individuals including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. This incident follows previous scrutiny of Waltz's use of Signal, including accidentally inviting a journalist to a group chat discussing a potential U.S. attack. Despite the administration's stance that Signal is approved, the Pentagon's watchdog has criticized the use of such apps for official communication.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed lawsuits against Hawaii, Michigan, New York, and Vermont, challenging their climate policies as unconstitutional and a threat to U.S. energy independence. The suits target New York and Vermont's "climate superfund" laws, which impose liability on fossil fuel companies for climate change contributions, arguing they are preempted by the Clean Air Act. Lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan aim to block state-level litigation against energy firms. The DOJ asserts these state actions impede domestic energy production and aid U.S. adversaries, aligning with President Trumpâ€™s Executive Order 14260.</p>

          <p>China is evaluating whether to start trade negotiations with the United States following overtures from Washington, signaling a potential easing of the tariff war between the two countries. The Ministry of Commerce stated that the US must demonstrate sincerity by addressing its "wrong practices" and removing unilateral tariffs. The article suggests that while China is open to talks, it will not accept coercion or the use of negotiations as a cover for extortion. The move could lead to a more constructive dialogue between the two economic powers.</p>
