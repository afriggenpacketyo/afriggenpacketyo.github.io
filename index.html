          <p>A Quinnipiac University poll indicates that a majority of Democrats disapprove of their party's congressional members' job performance. The survey, conducted in early June, reveals that 53% of Democrats disapprove, while only 41% approve. Overall, only 21% of all voters approve of the way Democrats in Congress are handling their jobs, matching an all-time low since 2009. The poll also shows a decline in President Trump's approval ratings among voters nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, bypassing the standard CDC selection process. Kennedy's picks include individuals who have publicly criticized vaccine recommendations and questioned their safety, such as Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about mRNA vaccines. The panel's recommendations are influential, directly impacting federal policies and insurance coverage for vaccines.

          <p>Los Angeles is bracing for the arrival of Marines as California sues to prevent military involvement in immigration protests. President Trump federalized National Guard troops and sent in Marines, despite objections from local officials. Legal experts question the military's role, citing the Posse Comitatus law. The 700 Marines are reportedly at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, receiving civil disturbance training. California has asked a federal court to block the government from using troops outside of federal property.</p>
