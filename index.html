          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at U.S. Vogue. While she will remain CondÃ© Nast's chief content officer and Vogue's global editorial director, the U.S. edition will hire a new head of editorial content. This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other global editions and allows the 75-year-old Wintour to focus on her broader oversight roles.

          <p>Arizona's saguaro cactus, a symbol of the American Southwest adapted to desert heat, is now struggling to survive due to rising temperatures. Researchers at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix report a dramatic increase in the annual death rate of saguaros, from 1-2% to nearly 7% in recent years. The prolonged, extreme heat waves are causing the cacti to suffer from what resembles heat stroke, far outpacing their slow rate of reproduction. Scientists are now working to identify and cultivate more resilient varieties to ensure the species' survival.</p>

          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for ten games for violating the league's personal conduct policy, following an investigation into numerous sexual misconduct allegations. The suspension is effective regardless of whether he is signed to a team. The investigation stemmed from a report detailing accusations from at least 16 massage therapists between 2012 and 2016. Tucker, who was released by the Ravens in May, continues to deny the allegations but has accepted the resolution to move forward.</p>

          <p>A large and bright meteorite, described as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with the energy of about 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported the object was approximately three feet in diameter and weighed over a ton, traveling at 30,000 miles per hour. The explosion created a pressure wave that resulted in audible booms heard by residents on the ground. Experts suggest the rare daylight event may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>In the closing arguments of Sean 'Diddy' Combs's sex trafficking trial, federal prosecutors portrayed the hip-hop mogul as the leader of a criminal enterprise who used his power to exploit and harm women. The prosecution argued that Combs relied on a 'small army' of employees to facilitate sex crimes and then conceal his conduct, believing his fame and wealth placed him above the law. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, and faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. The defense will present its closing arguments on Friday.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly declared victory over Israel and the U.S. following a recent military exchange, claiming to have crushed the 'Zionist regime.' Despite his assertions of hitting numerous military targets, the reality is that Iran's missile attacks resulted in relatively few Israeli casualties and were largely intercepted. In contrast, U.S. and Israeli strikes are reported to have killed over 1,000 people in Iran, including military personnel, and significantly damaged the country's nuclear program. The rhetoric appears aimed at a domestic audience amid palpable anxiety in Tehran.</p>

          <p>The victory of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist, in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary has reignited a debate over the ideological direction of the national party. Mamdani's win over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, achieved with a campaign focused on affordability and bold progressive policies, highlights a generational and ideological rift. While some see his playbook as a path forward for energizing voters, moderate Democrats have expressed concern over his 'extreme' positions. The upset raises the question of whether his success is a model for Democrats nationwide.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially launched his reelection campaign, positioning himself as a 'blue collar' candidate with a record of delivering results. Running as an independent, Adams framed the race as a choice between his practical progress and the 'empty promises' of his chief rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani. He contrasted his own background with Mamdani's, whom he painted as privileged and inexperienced. Adams touted his administration's achievements in reducing crime, creating jobs, and building housing, while dismissing Mamdani's socialist platform.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. and Israeli strikes, a detailed assessment reveals significant but varied damage to Iran's key nuclear facilities. The heavily fortified Fordo enrichment site was targeted with massive bunker-busting bombs, likely rendering it inoperable, though the full extent of the damage is hard to confirm. The primary enrichment site at Natanz and the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan suffered severe damage to their main halls and surface buildings. However, experts caution that Iran may have moved its stockpile of highly enriched uranium and could possess other undisclosed backup sites.</p>

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's 'Summer Davos' event, an economic expert argued that the U.S. dollar's role as the global reserve currency is diminishing. Diana Choyleva of the Asia Society Policy Institute stated that factors like U.S. economic mismanagement and the use of sanctions are pushing countries, especially China, to seek alternatives. She suggested that China is actively working to create a separate financial sphere centered on the yuan. This push, combined with the rise of digital currencies, positions the yuan as a potential challenger to the dollar's long-held dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
