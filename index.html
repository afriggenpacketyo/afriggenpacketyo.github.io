        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complex and often exploitative prison economy, where governments spend billions to incarcerate millions, with private corporations profiting from various services and organized crime syndicates running contraband empires. Inmates navigate an informal marketplace where basic necessities become currency, often trapped in cycles of debt and violence, and prison labor helps cut operational costs with minimal wages. The article highlights the need for thorough oversight and rehabilitation efforts to address mismanagement, security threats, and the failure to curb prison overcrowding. The piece touches on gangs imposing order and also the potential for rehabilitation within prisons. The author points out that there is a need to focus on public accountability. The article paints a picture of a system rife with challenges and inequalities.</p>

          <p>This article previews Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK, which includes royal ceremonies and business meetings. Trump and First Lady Melania will be greeted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, followed by a carriage procession and a state banquet, and the President will also lay a wreath on the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II. Trump will meet with Keir Starmer to discuss potential UK investment commitments from Nvidia and OpenAI to support data center development. The visit's timing is awkward due to recent diplomatic issues, including the firing of the UK's US ambassador, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will address the future of TikTok. The article shows the importance of the visit and its potential to shape future relations.</p>

          <p>This article reports on a new study indicating that cannabis use, particularly THC, can negatively impact female fertility and artificial insemination. The research found that THC disrupts egg development and genetic stability, leading to a lower rate of euploid embryos. The study analyzed IVF outcomes of women with detectable THC in their follicular fluid and examined the effects of THC on isolated human eggs. While THC may speed up egg maturation, it also increases errors in chromosome distribution and defects in egg cell structure. Further research is needed to examine the effects of THC on different age groups and consumption habits, according to German experts.</p>
