          <p>An Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London, resulting in the deaths of nearly all 242 passengers and crew on board. Preliminary data indicates the plane reached a maximum altitude of 625 feet before crashing in a residential area, causing additional fatalities on the ground. Investigators will examine the plane's black boxes, maintenance records, pilot maneuvers, and weather conditions to determine the cause of the crash. While Boeing has faced manufacturing concerns with Dreamliners in the past, experts suggest it's too early to attribute the crash to such issues, as air crashes often involve multiple failures. This incident marks the first crash of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the deadliest plane crash in years.</p>

          <p>California Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed by federal officers after interrupting a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Padilla, seeking information on the administration's immigration enforcement actions, questioned Noem before being escorted out of the room. DHS claimed Padilla interrupted without identifying himself and lunged toward Secretary Noem, leading the Secret Service to perceive him as a potential attacker. The incident sparked outrage from California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who condemned the administration's actions as dictatorial and abhorrent. This event highlights the escalating tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and the administration's response to dissent.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is expected to issue an order imminently regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles to assist with enforcing federal immigration laws. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they consider an unlawful militarization. The state argues that the deployment, citing a rebellion or danger of rebellion, does not meet legal requirements, as the civil unrest is manageable by state and local authorities. The Department of Justice defends the deployment, asserting the President's authority to address what he deems an out-of-control situation and the need to prevent a rioters' veto of federal law enforcement.</p>

The violence, which began in Ballymena, has resulted in 41 officers injured and 15 arrests. The unrest started after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. In Portadown, police warned they would use baton rounds if the crowd did not disperse, while in Ballymena, the rioters appeared to have stayed away following increased police presence. An anti-racism protest in west Belfast also took place peacefully, while police described the violence as "racist thuggery" targeted at ethnic minorities and law enforcement.</p>

This statement follows the UN's nuclear watchdog finding Iran in non-compliance with its nonproliferation obligations. Trump has suggested military strikes are an option if current talks fail to curb Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. The US has begun evacuating staff from its embassy in Baghdad and military bases in the Middle East due to the increased risk of conflict, while Iran has announced the launch of a new enrichment facility in a secure location.</p>

Critics argue the funds could be better used to support military families or medical defense research, with some likening the display to those in authoritarian regimes. Trump defends the parade as a celebration of the country's greatness and the military's strength, while protests are planned to counterprogram the event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his support for Chinese students in America, promising to help them remain in the country after graduation. This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized that allowing Chinese nationals to study and work in the US is beneficial for both the schools and the country. He suggested that if these graduates are not allowed to stay, they will return to their countries and start businesses there, highlighting the importance of retaining their talent.</p>

          <p>Amid a US-China trade truce, negotiators in London reached a “framework” agreement to activate the Geneva deal, raising hopes for an immediate alleviation of the trade conflict, including potentially a US commitment to revoke some of its tech embargoes in return for China’s relaxation of rare earth export restrictions. The full details of the London agreement are expected to be available after both US President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping have approved it. Critically, China unprecedentedly tightened its rare earth exports, displaying its ability to retaliate. The pain inflicted on US car manufacturers and defence companies was obviously the most pressing reason for Trump to talk to Xi, as the trade tussle was rapidly escalating into a crisis of global supply chains.</p>

Key areas of focus include modifying SNAP work requirements, lowering the SALT deduction cap, reducing border security funding, and reforming Medicaid.

          <p>Democratic governors of Illinois, Minnesota, and New York criticized President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles during a House Oversight Committee hearing on immigration policy. They described the deployment as an "overreach of epic proportions" that undermines state sovereignty. The governors defended their states' immigration policies and emphasized the importance of coordination between state and federal governments. The hearing also involved heated exchanges between Republican committee members and the governors regarding sanctuary policies and crime rates.</p>
