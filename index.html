        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating a massive Republican spending bill that faces a contentious path forward. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the legislation could add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national debt while causing approximately 12 million Americans to lose healthcare coverage through significant cuts to Medicaid. Democrats have strongly criticized the bill as a tax cut for the wealthy financed by reducing essential services for low-income families. The bill's passage remains uncertain as Republican leaders work to secure enough votes from within their own party amid concerns over its financial and social impacts.</p>

          <p>University of Virginia President Jim Ryan has resigned following what is described as a pressure campaign from the Trump administration related to a federal investigation into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Senator Mark Warner called the action an "outrageous" case of extortion, stating that Ryan was explicitly threatened with massive funding cuts if he did not resign by a specific deadline. In his resignation letter, Ryan warned that resisting would have cost hundreds of jobs and student aid, highlighting a growing concern over political interference and threats to academic freedom at public universities.</p>

          <p>New York City Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa has firmly stated he will not drop out of the race, dismissing rumors that donors are seeking to replace him with a candidate like incumbent Eric Adams. Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, blamed Adams for the rise of socialist Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and positioned himself as the only true New Yorker in the race. He believes a split vote between Mamdani, Adams, and a potential independent run by Andrew Cuomo could pave his way to victory. Sliwa's campaign focuses on public safety, housing affordability, and animal welfare.</p>

Despite being barred from running for office until 2030 for abusing his power, his supporters chanted for his return.

The phenomenon is set against a backdrop of economic decline post-reunification and a history of racist violence in the region. Despite the city's rich cultural heritage, including its Bauhaus legacy, civic groups and concerned citizens are fighting an uphill battle against rising hostility and the growing influence of far-right politics.</p>

However, this article notes that many nutrition researchers and scientists maintain that there is a lack of strong evidence to support these claims.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) following the recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, cautioning against premature conclusions. It explains that early assessments, like a leaked DIA memo suggesting minimal damage, are often incomplete, as a full picture requires integrating various intelligence sources over time. Drawing on historical examples, the author argues that the cumulative effect of the strikes, combined with sophisticated munitions and delivery platforms, likely caused severe and lasting damage to Iran's nuclear ecosystem. The piece suggests that official U.S. declarations of success are probably closer to the truth than critics' hasty dismissals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a Fox News interview that he has secured a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok. He described the prospective buyers as a group of "very wealthy people" and stated he would provide more details in about two weeks. The sale is contingent on approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes President Xi Jinping will likely grant. This development comes after Trump repeatedly delayed the enforcement of a U.S. law passed last year that mandates TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, sell the platform due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A gold mine collapse in Sudan's Houeid region has resulted in the deaths of at least 11 miners, with seven others injured. The state-owned mining company reported that the collapse occurred in an artisanal shaft where work had previously been suspended due to safety risks. Such incidents are frequent in Sudan's poorly regulated mining sector. The tragedy is set against the backdrop of Sudan's brutal civil war, where gold mining and smuggling play a crucial role in funding the war efforts of both the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.</p>
