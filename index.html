          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:07:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of existing homes in the United States fell by 2.7% in June, a larger drop than anticipated, as mortgage rates remained high. Despite the decrease in sales volume, the median home price reached a new record of $435,300 for the month, marking the 24th consecutive month of annual price increases. The National Association of Realtors attributes the sluggish sales to elevated mortgage rates, suggesting that a decline to 6% could significantly boost sales activity and help more first-time buyers enter the market. The supply of homes for sale has increased but remains below the level of a balanced market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hershey Announces Double-Digit Price Hikes Due to Soaring Cocoa Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:03:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company is set to implement a low double-digit price increase across its candy portfolio, citing the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price hike is a direct response to a global cocoa shortage driven by adverse weather conditions in West Africa and chronic underinvestment in cocoa farms. Cocoa prices have skyrocketed in recent years, prompting Hershey to also focus on developing products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its broader strategy to become a "snacking powerhouse." The company confirmed the change is unrelated to tariffs, and its share prices saw a notable increase following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:01:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system named Aeneas that can fill in missing text from damaged ancient Roman inscriptions, as well as estimate their date and geographical origin. The tool assists historians by rapidly analyzing a vast database of 176,000 inscriptions to find relevant parallels, a process that would traditionally take months or years. While there are concerns about AI introducing errors, tests have shown that historians working in conjunction with Aeneas produce more accurate results than either working alone. This technology is being hailed as potentially transformative for accelerating the study and understanding of ancient history.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in select U.S. cities that will allow women drivers and riders to request a preference for being paired with other women. The feature, set to roll out next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aims to provide more choice, control, and comfort for women using the platform. While the preference is not guaranteed, it increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman match. This initiative follows a similar feature Uber introduced in other countries and comes as the company continues to address long-standing safety concerns, including sexual assault and harassment incidents, on its platform.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations has issued a stark warning of "mass starvation" in the Gaza Strip, attributing the crisis to the Israeli government's siege and restrictions on aid. The joint statement highlights severe food and water shortages, with 90% of the population facing difficulty accessing water and some aid workers now needing to queue for food. The Gaza Ministry of Health reports a rising death toll from malnutrition, particularly among children, a claim disputed by an Israeli government spokesperson who blames Hamas for engineering the shortage. The dire situation is underscored by reports of deadly incidents around aid distribution centers.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's recent behavior regarding his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting his actions appear evasive rather than transparent. The analysis points to several instances, including Trump's denial of writing a note in Epstein's scrapbook, his attempt to have a news story spiked, and his efforts to deflect questions by attacking political opponents. The author contrasts this behavior with how an innocent person might act, highlighting that Trump's strategy of labeling the issue a "witch hunt" mirrors his defense in other cases involving proven wrongdoing. The piece concludes that the pattern of deflection and distraction makes his claims of innocence seem less plausible.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a key provision of a Tennessee law that criminalized adults for helping minors obtain out-of-state abortions without parental consent. The judge ruled that the law's "recruitment provision," which banned providing information or travel assistance, constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination and violated the First Amendment. The case was brought by a Democratic state representative and a pro-abortion advocate. While this part of the law was struck down, the judge upheld other sections that criminalize physically transporting or harboring a minor for the purpose of an out-of-state abortion, rejecting claims that the law was unconstitutionally vague.</p>

The Indian government has acknowledged the problem and is implementing measures to provide psychological support.

This type of infection typically occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, often during recreational activities in warm freshwater. With a fatality rate exceeding 97%, health officials emphasize preventive measures like holding one's nose or using nose clips when in freshwater, as the amoeba cannot cause infection if swallowed.</p>

The card showed a $400 billion investment figure crossed out and replaced with "500," while Trump's social media post claimed a $550 billion investment from Japan. Similarly, the card displayed a 10% tariff rate, but the president announced a 15% rate, leaving analysts and officials to decipher the actual terms.

          <p>As rising costs and interest rates push more households into debt, financial experts are highlighting several effective relief strategies. Options range from methodical repayment plans like the debt avalanche, which prioritizes high-interest debt to save money, to debt consolidation using personal loans or balance transfer credit cards to secure a lower interest rate. For those with more severe struggles, a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can negotiate better terms with creditors. More drastic measures like debt settlement, which aims to reduce the principal owed, and bankruptcy are also available but come with significant risks to one's credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will begin using cane sugar in the U.S. is seen as a significant victory for the American sugar industry. For decades, the sugar lobby has benefited from government protectionism, including high tariffs and price guarantees, which the Trump administration has expanded. The move by Coca-Cola, which currently uses corn syrup for its U.S. products, could increase demand and prices for domestic sugar producers. This political maneuver has puzzled some, as it potentially alienates corn farmers, a much larger voter base, but aligns with the sugar industry's substantial political contributions and lobbying power.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At the time, the 19-year-old was given a suspended prison sentence, while her assailant received a lighter penalty for lesser charges. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 79, sought to clear her name, leading to a retrial where prosecutors have formally apologized and requested her acquittal. The case is a landmark moment for South Korea, challenging historical judicial perspectives on self-defense in cases of sexual violence.</p>

The charges do not relate to his professional conduct as a surgeon at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's efforts to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates could backfire and harm the U.S. economy. While Trump desires lower borrowing costs, his public threats against Fed Chair Jerome Powell and demands for rate cuts risk undermining the central bank's credibility. Experts warn that if investors lose faith in the Fed's independence, they may demand higher returns on U.S. government bonds to compensate for inflation and political risk. This could paradoxically lead to higher long-term interest rates for mortgages and other loans, ultimately making borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China maintained its position as the world's leading shipbuilder but saw its share of new global orders dip to 68.3% in the first half of the year, down from nearly 75% in the same period last year. The decline in order volume is partly attributed to shipowners' caution in ordering new oil and LNG tankers, given the United States' prominent role as an exporter of these commodities. Despite the slight decrease, analysts believe China's competitive advantages in the shipbuilding industry remain strong. The US is the world's largest exporter of LNG and saw record-high crude oil exports in 2024, influencing global shipping dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed an innovative software platform that they claim breaks the "curse of dimensionality" in aircraft design, a long-standing challenge that limits the number of variables designers can optimize simultaneously. To demonstrate its capability, the researchers applied the software to the design of the US Navy's canceled X-47B stealth drone. They reported dramatic improvements by optimizing 740 variables at once, enhancing stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion—the very trade-offs that led to the American program's cancellation. This breakthrough could allow for the creation of more advanced and efficient aircraft by removing previous computational constraints.</p>

The phenomenon challenges traditional views of evolution, suggesting that symbiosis—the merging of different life forms—may be a more significant evolutionary driver than previously thought.
