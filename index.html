          <p>A private survey indicated that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew in August, driven by increased new orders and a recovery in export business, supported by a trade-war truce with the U.S. The RatingDog manufacturing purchasing managers' index reached 50.5, exceeding economists' estimates and signaling the fastest expansion rate since March. Zichun Huang from Capital Economics noted the resilience of external demand despite tariffs, but Yao Yu of RatingDog cautioned that domestic demand remains soft. This contrasts with China's official manufacturing PMI, which showed a fifth consecutive month of contraction in August, highlighting a mixed economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of BYD, a Chinese electric vehicle maker and Tesla competitor, experienced a significant drop of nearly 8% in Hong Kong due to a 30% slump in second-quarter profits. The decline comes amidst an aggressive price war within China's EV industry, impacting the company's financial performance despite revenue growth driven by overseas sales. BYD reported net profits of 6.36 billion yuan ($891 million) for the June quarter, despite a 14% year-over-year revenue increase to 201 billion yuan. The company attributed the profit decrease to heightened price competition and excessive marketing within China's electric vehicle market.</p>

          <p>Rosie O'Donnell apologized on social media after incorrectly asserting that the Minneapolis church school shooter was a Republican, MAGA supporter, and white supremacist. The actress initially made the claims in an emotional video following the attack, which resulted in the deaths of two children and injuries to 18 others. O'Donnell acknowledged her mistake and admitted she had not done her due diligence before making the statement, attributing her assumptions to a perceived standard profile of shooters. Her apology drew criticism online, with some users accusing her of insincerity and highlighting the broader issue of misinformation causing division in the country.</p>

          <p>A report commissioned by the Australian government examines the feasibility of implementing a social media ban for individuals under 16, finding that while technically possible, all methods have risks and shortcomings. The ban, slated to take effect in December, aims to mitigate the harmful impacts of social media on children. The report evaluated various age verification methods, including government documents, parental approval, and facial recognition technology, recommending a layered approach for a more robust system. Concerns were raised about data privacy, accuracy, and potential circumvention through document forgeries and VPNs, as the government seeks to balance safety and privacy.</p>

          <p>A new book, *Power and the Palace*, recounts an incident where Queen Camilla, as a teenager, fought off an attempted sexual assault on a train to Paddington Station. The Queen reportedly told Boris Johnson about the experience in 2008, detailing how she used her shoe to defend herself, following her mother's advice. Buckingham Palace has not disputed the account, and sources close to the Queen say she has not previously shared this story publicly to avoid drawing attention away from the victims of domestic violence and sexual assault that she supports. The Queen's public work focuses on supporting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, advocating for survivors to come forward without fear or shame.</p>

          <p>Officials in the United Kingdom are warning of potential shortages of staple vegetables due to prolonged drought conditions and above-average temperatures. Broccoli farmers are experiencing significantly reduced yields, with some crops not meeting expected standards. Farmers express confidence in growing enough produce, but continued drought could lead to empty shelves. The UK has experienced record-breaking heat and dry weather, depleting water resources and prompting drought declarations, causing Jack Ward of the British Growers Association to voice concerns about water supplies.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker criticized a reported plan by the Trump administration to send military troops to Chicago, calling it an "invasion" and suggesting the president has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker accused Trump of potentially aiming to control elections and said sending troops is an attack on the American people. The White House rejected Pritzker's accusations, citing Chicago's high crime rate, and Trump criticized the governor for refusing help. Pritzker referenced Germany's history, expressing concerns about authoritarian tendencies and potential election interference.</p>

The 35kg rover is scheduled to launch in 2029 and will land in the Moon's south polar region, one of the most inhospitable places on the lunar surface. The rover will also demonstrate Canadian technology, building on Canada's history in space. The company is testing components to ensure they can survive the Moon's harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures and the sticky lunar soil.</p>

          <p>The United States has reportedly suspended visa approvals for nearly all Palestinian passport holders, according to the New York Times. The restrictions extend beyond previous measures announced on visitors from Gaza, preventing Palestinians from traveling to the United States for medical treatment, education, or business. The State Department said it was halting visitor visas for individuals from Gaza while conducting a review and has also begun denying visas to members of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The move aligns the Trump administration with Israel's stance on a Palestinian state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of the largest expansion of publicly funded childcare support has begun in England, providing more help with nursery costs for working parents. Eligible parents can now access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time for children aged nine months to four years, paid for by the government. However, parents report facing long waiting lists and staff shortages limiting availability, with nurseries struggling to meet rising demand. Research suggests workforce issues, low pay, and limited progression opportunities could hinder delivering the promised offer to parents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global matcha craze is causing supply challenges in Japan, with shops rationing supply and prices doubling in the last year. Japan's green tea exports have increased significantly, with the U.S. being a major consumer, leading the Japanese government to consider subsidizing farmers to encourage more tencha cultivation. Tencha prices have surged, and shops are limiting purchases to discourage hoarding, as online stores sold out months ago. Retailers worry that this summer's record heatwave could lower next year's tea harvest and push prices even higher. (not investment advice)</p>
