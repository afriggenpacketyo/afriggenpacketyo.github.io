          <p>During the G7 summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom, alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump humorously blamed the wind after accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentified the agreement as being with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the UK, and Trump admitted that it was not significantly different from the one signed in May. He praised Prime Minister Starmer's work and indicated the deal would produce jobs and income for both countries, with additional details provided on steel and aluminum quotas. Optimism about the potential economic benefits of the trade agreement is present in the article's coverage.</p>

          <p>President Trump left the G7 summit in Canada early to address "important matters" related to the Middle East, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. This schedule change resulted in the cancellation of bilateral meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as a planned press conference. Trump had earlier posted a warning on social media urging the evacuation of Tehran and stated that Iran wants to "talk" about de-escalation amidst ongoing aerial attacks between Tehran and Israel. Trump also said that he thought Iran was "very close" to having a nuclear weapon, dismissing recent intelligence reports to the contrary.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making a break-even operating margin in 2025 unlikely, according to CEO Joanna Geraghty. The airline will reduce off-peak flights, trim unprofitable routes, pause the retrofit of older Airbus A320 jets, and assess hiring plans. These measures come after a federal judge blocked JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit Airlines and its Northeast U.S. alliance with American Airlines. Despite these challenges, JetBlue plans to continue bringing on new frontline employees, outfit some planes with domestic-first class, and build airport lounges, while also pursuing a new partnership with United Airlines.</p>

          <p>With economic uncertainty and concerns about Social Security, annuities are gaining traction as guaranteed income solutions for retirement, particularly for seniors. A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 75 can provide substantial monthly income, with estimates ranging from $3,173 to $3,415 for single individuals and $2,736 for joint life options, influenced by gender, interest rates, and annuity structure. While offering financial security, immediate annuities eliminate access to the principal and potential for higher investment returns, making it crucial to consider one's overall financial picture and health. This decision should be based on individual financial needs and long-term goals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senators Warren and Representative Schakowsky are pressing five major pharmaceutical companiesâ€”Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, and Amgenâ€”regarding their low tax bills and lobbying efforts. They allege that these companies avoid U.S. taxes by shifting profits to offshore subsidiaries, a practice they claim was enabled by a provision in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The lawmakers question whether the companies' lobbying efforts aim to maintain this tax loophole in Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which could make many provisions in the 2017 tax act permanent and cut spending on programs for low-income Americans. Democrats are trying to build public opposition to the legislation as the GOP attempts to balance competing party interests to pass it.</p>

This incident is not isolated, as similar scams have targeted other nonprofits, including animal rescues, exploiting donation drives for various causes.

          <p>Homebuilder sentiment in June dropped to 32, nearing pandemic lows, due to higher mortgage rates and broader economic uncertainty, according to the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI).

Rising inventory levels and hesitant buyers are weakening price growth, leading NAHB to forecast a decline in single-family starts for 2025.

          <p>Downing Street has expressed concern over the "deteriorating" situation involving small boats crossing the English Channel, with over 16,000 migrants having crossed this year, a 42% increase compared to the same period last year. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to "work closely" to tackle the crossings, focusing on high-ambition outcomes that benefit both the British and French people. Ministers are urging the French government to implement stricter rules to intercept boats, following a deal in 2023 that provided France with nearly Â£500m to enhance border security. The Labour government has scrapped the Conservative plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, redirecting funds to border security initiatives.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. fell 0.9% in May, exceeding expectations of a 0.6% decline, as consumers pulled back on spending, weighed down by declining gas sales and economic unease. The decline followed a 0.1% loss in April and came amid unease over tariffs and geopolitical tensions, while sales rose 3.3% from a year ago. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3%, which was also worse than the estimate for a gain of 0.1%. The pullback came despite surveys showing that consumer sentiment actually improved in May, though compared with levels that had been falling through the year.</p>

          <p>The domestic deployment of active-duty U.S. military, such as the current deployment in Los Angeles, is rare and fraught with risk. Parallels can be drawn to the period between 1957 and 1968, when military forces were actively involved on U.S. soil on eight separate occasions. While these deployments resulted in only one fatality, they occurred during a time of strong bipartisan consensus and respect for institutional expertise, norms that are now weakened. The author argues that the political climate surrounding the current deployment is dramatically different, with elites seeking to use the military for political gain, potentially leading to a violent outcome.</p>

Prosecutors allege Plasencia referred to Perry as a "moron" who could be exploited for money and supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine, ketamine lozenges, and syringes.

Experts predict that gold could reach $4,000 per ounce within one to two years, depending on various factors such as global instability, central bank demand, and inflation. They recommend strategies for investing in the gold market, including maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds (not investment advice).

This decline comes after sharp declines in consumer confidence this year, but inflation has cooled steadily and unemployment remains low, which could fuel steady spending in the coming months, as the economy has remained mostly solid.</p>
