          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the necessary ingredients. He allegedly told police that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and expressed no remorse, stating he would repeat the attack. The suspect is in the United States illegally, having entered on a B2 visa that expired in February 2023, and had been planning the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation. Optimism here is quite low, considering the premeditated nature of the attack and the suspect's expressed intent to kill. </p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine failed to agree on a ceasefire during recent talks in Istanbul but committed to exchanging sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well as those under 25. Ukrainian negotiators stated that Russia rejected an unconditional ceasefire, a key demand by Kyiv and its allies, while Russia proposed a two- or three-day truce in certain areas. The two sides agreed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers, with Russia handing over 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers next week and Ukraine returning 6,000 Russian soldiers. Russia continues to demand Ukraine's military withdrawal from occupied regions and the recognition of annexed territories. While prisoner swaps are a positive sign, the lack of ceasefire agreement indicates ongoing conflict and instability. </p>

          <p>Senator Lindsey Graham, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, is escalating calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill following talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The proposed Senate measure would impose a 500% tariff on any country buying Moscow's energy products. Graham stated that the Senate would move forward with the sanctions bill, aiming to put Russia on a "trade island" and hold countries like China and India accountable for supporting Putin's war machine. The bill has bipartisan support and around 80 co-sponsors, but President Trump's endorsement is pending. The potential for stricter sanctions indicates increased pressure on Russia, but the ultimate impact depends on international cooperation and Trump's approval. (not investment advice)</p>

This move allows Robinhood to offer institutional crypto flows, lending and staking infrastructure, and white-label "crypto-as-a-service" products. Robinhood aims to rebrand itself as a serious player in digital asset finance, focusing on regulation, institutional capital, and cross-border competition.

          <p>Following Ukraine's surprise attack on Russian offensive weapons caches using drones, experts are warning that the U.S. remains vulnerable to similar attacks. Col. Seth Krummrich suggests the issue is not technological but a policy/authority process to engage and deny drone attacks. He assesses that it will take a major drone strike in the U.S. to change policy, highlighting the ease with which drones can be hidden and modified for lethal purposes. Gen. David Grange emphasizes the need for a shift from reactive posture to proactive deterrence, noting the potential for gang members, terrorists, and sleeper agents to exploit drone technology. The potential for drone attacks highlights vulnerabilities in U.S. security, prompting calls for improved detection and defense measures. </p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a former member of the Manson family convicted in 1971 for the killings of Sharon Tate and others, has been recommended for parole, pending a final decision by Governor Gavin Newsom. This is the second time Krenwinkel has been approved for parole, with Newsom reversing the previous decision in 2022. Krenwinkel's attorney argues that she has fully accepted responsibility and no longer poses a public safety risk, citing therapy, counseling, and psychological evaluations. Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister, is advocating against Krenwinkel's release, emphasizing the gruesomeness of the crimes. The parole decision will become final after 120 days if cleared by the parole board, after which Newsom has 30 days to decide. The potential parole of Krenwinkel highlights ongoing debates about redemption and justice for heinous crimes. </p>

          <p>Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber's head of delivery and one of its longest-tenured top executives, is leaving the company after nearly 13 years. Gore-Coty joined Uber in 2012 and played a significant role in its global expansion, particularly in the mobility and delivery sectors. Andrew Macdonald, the company's senior vice president of mobility and business operations, will become chief operating officer, overseeing mobility, delivery, and autonomous businesses. The leadership change comes as Uber reported first-quarter results that beat on earnings but missed on revenue, with the FTC suing Uber over deceptive billing practices. The departure of a long-serving executive signals a transition within Uber, but the appointment of Macdonald ensures continuity in key operational areas. </p>

Rebecca GonzÃ¡lez-Ramos, the Special Agent in Charge, stated that the mandate is to remove everyone without immigration status. ICE agents are employing more aggressive strategies, including surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, questioning people on the street, and seeking data from the Department of Motor Vehicles. The operations have sparked fear within Dominican communities, as most arrests have been of Dominican nationals.

They estimate the bill would add over $3 trillion to the public debt, putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

          <p>Credit card interest rates are unlikely to decrease in June 2025 due to the Federal Reserve's paused interest rate cuts, a stable prime rate, and general economic uncertainty. The average credit card interest rate remains high, hovering just under 22%. Experts advise borrowers to explore debt relief options proactively, such as credit card debt forgiveness, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer credit cards. Waiting for rates to decline is not advisable, as proactive measures can lead to significant savings and financial independence.

          <p>A newly released transcript of the audio recording from the Dali container ship reveals the moments leading up to and following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The transcript shows routine conversation before alarms began sounding and the ship lost power, followed by frantic efforts to warn of the impending collision. The pilot issued a security call stating the ship had lost power and was approaching the bridge. The recording captured the moment of impact and subsequent expletives as the bridge collapsed, killing six construction workers. The transcript supports claims of negligence against the ship's owners and operators for failing to address prior electrical issues. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the Education Department, renewing his commitment to reduce the department's role. The budget requests $66.7 billion for the department, indicating a gradual dismantling rather than an immediate closure. While Title I funding remains stable, the budget proposes consolidating and cutting funding for various K-12 programs and reducing the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grants for college students. The proposed changes would shift more responsibility to states and reduce federal support for education. </p>
