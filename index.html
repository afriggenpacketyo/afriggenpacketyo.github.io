          <p>A federal judge dismissed with prejudice the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.  The Department of Justice dropped the charges, citing concerns that the case interfered with Adams' mayoral campaign and his ability to cooperate on immigration.  The dismissal prevents Adams from being retried on the same charges, ending his legal jeopardy.  Adams' attorney celebrated the decision as a victory for justice, while opponents criticized it as a political bargain.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to reduce the number of routine food and drug inspections due to recent layoffs of support staff.  The layoffs, part of broader cuts within the Department of Health and Human Services, have impacted administrative and management personnel crucial for supporting inspectors.  This reduction in inspections raises concerns about potential delays in addressing safety risks and ensuring compliance. The cuts are likely to worsen existing challenges in meeting inspection goals.</p>

          <p>A data analysis of the reality show 'Married at First Sight' reveals strikingly low success rates for couples formed through the show's premise.  The study examined data from multiple seasons, finding that a majority of couples separated before the end of filming, and only a small percentage remained together long-term.  The analysis suggests that marrying a stranger is a highly unreliable path to a lasting relationship, particularly without legal binding. The show's format and inherent drama likely also contribute to the low success rates.</p>
