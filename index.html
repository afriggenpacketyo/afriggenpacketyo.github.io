          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike due to disagreements over pay raises, causing a complete shutdown of train service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters.

          <p>Researchers are planning to build a magma observatory in Iceland, called the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT), to improve volcano eruption forecasting. By drilling into a magma chamber and inserting monitoring equipment, scientists hope to gain real-time data about the inner workings of volcanoes. This project aims to address the current limitations in volcanology, where predictions are often based on pattern recognition rather than a deep understanding of the physics of volcanic activity. The KMT could revolutionize the field by providing direct measurements of magma chambers, leading to more accurate and timely eruption forecasts.</p>
