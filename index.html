          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway for Michael Paul Brown, an Army veteran suspected of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities from local, state, and federal agencies are searching a mountainous area west of the town after locating the suspect's abandoned getaway vehicle. Brown, who lived next to the bar, is considered armed and dangerous, and residents have been urged to stay indoors and lock their doors. The incident has prompted responses from state officials and adds to the growing number of mass shootings in the U.S. for the year.</p>

          <p>England's pursuit of a 374-run target to win the fifth Test and the series against India was dealt a late blow on day three when Zak Crawley was dismissed. The hosts ended the day at 50-1, still needing 324 runs for a historic victory at The Oval. Earlier, India posted a formidable second-innings total of 396, largely thanks to a brilliant century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a surprise fifty from nightwatchman Akash Deep. England's bowlers toiled on an improving batting pitch, hampered by six dropped catches throughout the innings.</p>

          <p>A WNBA game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Chicago Sky was briefly interrupted when a neon green dildo was thrown onto the court, the second such incident at a Valkyries road game this week. The event prompted online commentary from players, with Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham calling for the behavior to stop. In a lighthearted exchange on social media, Chicago's Angel Reese jokingly blamed Las Vegas Aces player Sydney Colson for the recurring incidents. The playful banter highlights a bizarre trend that has emerged during recent games.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, has confirmed it is investigating former Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The inquiry follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into Donald Trump's role in the January 6th Capitol riot and handling of classified documents constituted illegal political activity. This agency can seek disciplinary action but cannot bring criminal charges itself. Smith, who brought two indictments against Trump, resigned in January 2025 before either case went to trial.</p>

          <p>The dating intelligence app 'Tea', which allows women to share information about men, has suffered a major data breach, exposing users' personal information including driver's licenses and private messages. The leaked data was reportedly posted on the message board 4chan, leading to threats against the app's users and raising serious privacy concerns. This incident has sparked a wider debate about the security and ethics of digital 'whisper networks,' which gained popularity during the Me Too era as a tool for women's safety but face criticism over anonymity and potential for misuse. The company now faces two class-action lawsuits over the breach.</p>

Yamashita's lead shrank after she carded a two-over 74, setting up a potentially dramatic conclusion with several players in close pursuit. Hull, who has had previous near-misses in major championships, expressed confidence in her ability to chase down the leader for a victory.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for their news, relying on content creators and algorithm-driven feeds rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew Research poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, consuming information through rapid-fire summaries, skits, and memes. This shift is driven by convenience and a preference for simplified, engaging content, with creators like Aaron Parnas gaining millions of followers by providing instant updates on major events. While users express trust in crowdsourced fact-checking, the trend raises concerns about misinformation and the depth of understanding gained from such formats.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's attempt to suspend the U.S. asylum system, ruling that the administration cannot bypass laws protecting migrants from deportation to countries where they face persecution or torture. The D.C. Circuit Court panel's decision modifies a lower court's ruling, allowing the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself but affirming that migrants must be allowed to apply for other mandatory humanitarian protections. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging Trump's proclamation that closed the border to asylum seekers, a measure the administration credits for a historic drop in illegal crossings.</p>

The case centers on controversial sweeps in Southern California that led to protests and were described by advocates as unconstitutional racial profiling.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profits, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its investment in Kraft Heinz. The company's net earnings fell to $12.37 billion, less than half of the same period last year. The writedown reflects ongoing challenges at the food giant, which is now exploring strategic options that could undo the merger Berkshire helped finance. Despite the drop in overall profit, Berkshire's operating earnings were only slightly down, and the conglomerate continues to hold a massive cash reserve of over $344 billion.

          <p>As international leaders debate Palestinian statehood, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is worsening, with residents describing a desperate and deadly struggle for food. Palestinians report that increased aid efforts, including airdrops and deliveries via the controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), are failing to alleviate widespread starvation. Many view the aid as symbolic and insufficient, with the process of obtaining it often proving fatal. The UN reports over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed trying to reach aid since May, highlighting the catastrophic conditions on the ground as the world engages in political discourse.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that matching your workout routine to your personality type could lead to greater enjoyment and adherence. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group activities like HIIT, while conscientious individuals enjoy goal-oriented training such as preparing for a marathon. People with higher levels of anxiety may benefit more from private, one-on-one sessions, and introverts gravitate towards solo exercises like running or at-home yoga. The findings suggest that instead of forcing a particular regimen, individuals can find a more sustainable fitness path by exploring activities that align with their innate traits.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 54, Malcolm-Jamal Warner is being remembered for his skillful and nuanced portrayal of Theo Huxtable on 'The Cosby Show.' As the only son in the family, his character's journey from a charismatic slacker to a responsible young adult was central to the series. Warner adeptly balanced Theo's humor and vulnerability, challenging his father's rigid definitions of success. The character's eventual diagnosis with dyslexia provided a powerful narrative arc, reframing his academic struggles and allowing him to find purpose in mentoring others, showcasing a transformation from a teen afraid of failure to an adult embracing growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, immediately following the release of a weak July jobs report. The report showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs, far below expectations, and included a steep downward revision of 258,000 jobs for the previous two months. Trump, without evidence, accused the agency of manipulating the numbers for political purposes and vowed to replace McEntarfer with someone more "competent." The unprecedented move drew sharp criticism from economists and policymakers, who warned it threatens the integrity and independence of crucial federal economic data.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, nearly 22 months after their abduction by Hamas. The meeting occurred as families protested to urge the Israeli government to increase efforts for the captives' release. Witkoff reportedly gave a personal commitment that he and President Trump would work to bring the remaining hostages home. The visit comes amid growing fears for the survival of the approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza, intensified by recent propaganda videos released by militant groups showing captives in poor condition.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to fire the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Erika McEntarfer, has drawn condemnation from senior members of his own party. The firing came after a report showed disappointing job growth, which Trump baselessly claimed was "RIGGED." Republican senators, including Cynthia Lummis and Thom Tillis, criticized the move as problematic and impetuous, warning that it undermines the credibility of objective government statistics. William Beach, a former BLS commissioner appointed by Trump, called the dismissal "totally groundless" and a dangerous precedent that politicizes vital economic data.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by a former rural mail carrier in Virginia highlights the vital role of the postal service in providing order and predictability, especially during times of crisis. The book, reviewed in The Atlantic, explores the blue-collar experience and the quiet heroism of showing up daily to connect communities. This consistency is a feat of logistics and dedication, from remote Appalachian routes to the most isolated village in America, which receives its mail via mule train. The article reflects on how services like the USPS help restore a sense of normalcy and connection in a country that can often feel fragmented.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that past hostile comments from Sean "Diddy" Combs make the prospect of a presidential pardon "more difficult." In a Newsmax interview, Trump referred to the music mogul as "sort of half-innocent" following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, despite acquittal on more serious counts. However, Trump noted that Combs's past statements, including a desire to see Trump "banished," cloud his judgment. This situation highlights Trump's history of weighing personal loyalty and political support when considering the use of his pardon power for controversial figures.</p>
