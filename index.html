          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders aimed at rebuilding the American drone industry and tightening airspace security, potentially restricting foreign drone manufacturers from selling new models in the U.S. The orders cite concerns about foreign-made drones endangering the public and compromising critical infrastructure.

All he needs to do is fund a few spoiler third-party candidates in a few key swing states and districts.
