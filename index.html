          <p>Amidst ongoing European diplomacy, the Ukrainian president expressed readiness to meet with Russia's leader in Turkey but insisted on an immediate truce before negotiations, while President Trump urged Ukraine to accept Russia's proposal for direct talks without a cease-fire prerequisite. European leaders had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions, a proposal that Russia countered with an offer of direct talks. Zelensky's declaration to personally attend negotiations adds complexity, as the flurry of exchanges unfolded after Putin rejected the cease-fire deadline and proposed talks in Istanbul, prompting European leaders to consult with Trump. The article highlights the diplomatic brinkmanship and the Trump administration's alignment with Russia on the war, contrasting with European insistence on a cease-fire first.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece cautions against framing the artificial intelligence race as solely between the United States and China, emphasizing the risks of unchecked AI development, such as the loss of human control over autonomous weapons and potential manipulation. The article argues that an AI race without proper consideration for safety and ethical guidelines could lead to a global 'lose-lose' scenario. It also notes that focusing solely on these two nations neglects the agency and interests of other countries, multinational organizations, and corporations that are not fully aligned with either Beijing or Washington. The author asserts that while AI model training is resource-intensive, model performance is only one part of the equation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is contemplating implementing stricter visa regulations aimed at addressing what it describes as a 'broken' migration system. Proposed changes include raising English language proficiency standards for all visa applicants and their adult dependents, along with extending the duration required to apply for settled status from five to ten years. A 'fast-track' settlement process would be established for professionals in high-demand fields like nursing and engineering. Critics caution that the new language rules could potentially divide families, while others suggest the extended settlement period could generate additional revenue for the Home Office through visa fees. The article explains that these measures are being considered in response to recent electoral gains made by Reform UK, a party advocating for stricter immigration controls.</p>

          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is considering a formal inquiry into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following numerous complaints from survivors regarding delays, difficulties in toxic substance testing, and low repair offers. The complaints stemmed from the Palisades and Eaton fires, prompting a Zoom session with over 200 survivors. State Farm claims it is focused on helping customers recover and has paid over $3.4 billion, however, the department sent a letter to the California FAIR Plan Assn. seeking information on smoke damage claims handling. Separately, State Farm awaits a decision on its request for an emergency rate hike, while fire victims urge Lara to defer any rate increases until complaints are fully investigated.</p>

          <p>A BBC news team documenting the work of an activist protecting Palestinian shepherds in the Israeli-occupied West Bank had a tense encounter with Moshe Sharvit, an Israeli settler sanctioned by Britain and the EU for alleged violence and intimidation against Palestinians. Sharvit, who believes the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, confronted the BBC team and accused them of being dangerous to Israel. The article highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future represented by Sharvit and the activist, and touches on the involvement of far-right government ministers in supporting settlement expansion. The BBC team was briefly blocked by Sharvit, who then agreed to an interview before police arrived and detained the activist who was assisting the BBC team.</p>

The families, representing Cantor Fitzgerald employees who died in the attack, cited recently unsealed evidence linking al-Bayoumi to the hijackers. The families emphasized the importance of accountability and justice, urging Lutnick to ensure al-Bayoumi faces justice in an American court. The families also cited a report revealing that al-Bayoumi filmed the Capitol before the attacks, information they claim was withheld from the public and the 9/11 commission for years.</p>

          <p>The White House on Sunday announced a "trade deal" with China without providing specifics, after Trump administration officials spent the weekend negotiating with their Chinese counterparts. While details of the deal are still unclear, any de-escalation in the ongoing trade war could bring much-needed relief to a global economy that has been roiled since President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the trade talks that took place in Geneva over the weekend were "productive." He said the talks yielded "a great deal" of productivity and that he would give more details in a complete briefing on Monday morning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he will use as Air Force One, four sources familiar with the planning confirmed to NBC News. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move. The administration will retrofit the plane so it can be used in Trump's official capacity as president. The plane, a Boeing 747-8 jet, is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term, two sources confirmed to NBC.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane, sources told CBS News. But the plane, a 747-8, won't be ready to serve as Air Force One quite yet, and Mr. Trump won't be using it to fly back to the U.S. from the Middle East. The plane needs to be checked for security and spying devices before it is accepted, one of the sources told CBS News. The plane will be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York confirmed to CBS News that he sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office urging an investigation into the Trump administration accepting a plane as a gift.</p>

The group includes 49 Afrikaner South Africans, made up of mainly families, as well as a few young couples in their twenties and older people. In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, who are an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists. The Trump, at the time, claimed that White South Africans faced "government-sponsored race-based discrimination.</p>

          <p>Hamas said on Sunday night that it would free Edan Alexander, the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, just days before President Trump is expected to arrive in the region for the first major foreign tour of his second term. In a statement, Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas’s lead negotiator, did not say when Mr. Alexander would be released and what, if anything, Hamas would get in exchange. Raised in Tenafly, N.J., Mr. Alexander, 21, moved to Israel to serve in the military after high school. He was at a military post on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed across the border in the surprise attack that ignited the war in Gaza.</p>

Real Madrid are expected to be Alexander-Arnold's next club. And a section of the Liverpool support took their first chance to let him know their feelings about his decision, booing him during the draw with Arsenal.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is reportedly ready to accept a luxury plane described to be a “palace in the sky” being offered to the US president as a gift from Qatar’s royal family, almost immediately igniting accusations of bribery and corruption as well as commensurate criticism. On Sunday, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, ABC reported that the Trump administration was girding itself to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8, a jumbo jet from the Qatari royals that was estimated to be about $400m. Trump would then use the 13-year-old plane as the new Air Force One until shortly before the conclusion of his second Oval Office stint, at which point it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation no later than 1 January 2029.</p>

The article emphasizes that before IDEA, many states chose not to educate children with disabilities, and that without federal oversight, states may not be held accountable for meeting the minimum requirements of IDEA.</p>

Harry’s emotional plea to be reconciled with his family — made in a recent interview with the BBC, in which he mused about how long his cancer-stricken father had left to live — resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, which has yet to find its footing in the still-fledgling Carolean era.</p>
