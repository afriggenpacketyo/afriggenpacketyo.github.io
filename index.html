          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan seeks progress in tariff negotiations with the United States but will not compromise national interests for a quick agreement. Ishiba's remarks precede a potential meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada. Japan has been urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy and pursue a mutually beneficial deal, emphasizing increased Japanese investment to create U.S. jobs. Ishiba stressed the importance of a deal that benefits both nations, rather than prioritizing speed at the expense of Japan's interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that ticket touts made millions by exploiting loopholes and allegedly receiving assistance from staff at major ticketing companies. Court documents and interviews with former ticketing staff suggest that touts were offered financial incentives, insider information, and even software designed to facilitate bulk ticket sales. Touts fraudulently circumvented purchase limits by using fake identities and multiple credit cards to acquire large quantities of tickets for resale at inflated prices. Ticketmaster, while not directly implicated in the court cases, stated that the allegations refer to outdated practices from long-defunct businesses and that they are committed to fair and secure ticketing.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move towards easing tensions between the two nations. The decision, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. This action follows South Korea's resumption of broadcasts last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloon campaign. While North Korea has not yet commented, South Korea hopes this gesture will lead to improved relations, though prospects for immediate dialogue remain uncertain due to ongoing nuclear disagreements and North Korea's strengthened ties with Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a collection of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 people who died from HIV/Aids, is being displayed at the Tate Modern in London.

The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to provide a space for remembrance and grieving, especially for those who were unable to properly mourn due to the stigma surrounding HIV at the time. The quilt includes tributes to notable figures such as novelist Bruce Chatwin and actor Ian Charleston.</p>

          <p>China is striving to build its own AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor imports. These restrictions not only limit access to advanced chips but also hinder the development of essential technologies for creating AI chips. Despite investing billions, China faces challenges across the semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips. While companies like Huawei's HiSilicon are making progress in GPU design, they still lag behind industry leaders like Nvidia, and manufacturing capabilities are limited by restrictions on advanced chipmaking equipment.

The event also drew attention to cultural ignorance among Trump's allies, with one advisor admitting he had never been to the Kennedy Center before.

          <p>The U.S. is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy staff and their dependents are being removed, and officials cite potential retaliation against U.S. sites in Iraq. This decision comes as U.S. talks over Iran's nuclear program have stalled, and Israel is reportedly ready to launch an operation into Iran. President Trump reiterated that the U.S. will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon and that Americans were advised to leave the region as it could be a dangerous place.</p>

          <p>Following two days of trade talks in London, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging agreement with China to maintain the fragile truce established after earlier discussions in Geneva. Trump stated the accord would address various points of contention, including shipments of rare earth minerals, student visas, and tariffs. However, China has been more reserved in its comments, indicating that representatives will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. The details of the agreement remain somewhat unclear, with China's official stance yet to be fully articulated.</p>

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert, Jeffrey Lewis, has released satellite images of what is believed to be a new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The image aligns with recent concerns raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the construction of a new structure with similar features to an existing enrichment plant. The facility includes a central hall where centrifuges could be installed, along with office and support spaces. The images and analysis suggest North Korea is expanding its production of enriched uranium, raising concerns about its nuclear program.</p>
