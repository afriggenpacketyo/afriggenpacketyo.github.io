          <p>A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a house fire in Brent, north-west London, resulted in the deaths of a 43-year-old mother, her 15-year-old daughter, and two boys aged eight and four. The fire, which broke out early Saturday morning, severely damaged two terraced three-storey homes. Two other family members, a woman in her 70s and a teenage girl, were hospitalized. Neighbors reported hearing smashing and screaming before discovering the blaze, and about 70 firefighters responded to the scene to help put out the fire.</p>

          <p>An explosion on a sewage boat docked on New York City's Hudson River resulted in the death of a Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) worker and injuries to two others. The incident occurred at the North River Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility in West Harlem. According to officials, the explosion happened in one of the vessel's holds, which is used to transport raw sewage. The deceased worker, a 33-year veteran of the DEP, was found between the pier and the boat, and the cause of the explosion is currently under investigation, with the U.S. Coast Guard suggesting it may be linked to hot work aboard the docked boat.</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough in electromagnetic coilgun technology, achieving a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute. This advancement significantly surpasses traditional firearms and existing commercial models. The breakthrough involves eliminating capacitors, a key limiting factor in previous coilgun designs, by directly powering the gun with lithium batteries. This development could potentially redefine future combat scenarios, according to military experts.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning propelled the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' pitching staff, already strained, faced further challenges after a 13-inning game the previous night. Tony Gonsolin, the Dodgers' starter, struggled with command in the fourth, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases before Soto's decisive hit. David Peterson, the Mets' starter, delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ⅔ innings and recording seven strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's online post, prompted by a false rumor, led to her imprisonment and ignited a debate about free speech. Connolly, a 41-year-old childminder, called for setting fire to hotels housing asylum seekers. She was sentenced to 31 months in jail after admitting to inciting racial hatred, a decision that has drawn criticism from free speech advocates who argue the sentence is disproportionate. Supporters claim her case highlights police overreach in monitoring online activity, while critics argue her tweet constituted a dangerous incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a problem at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort to visitors.

The expo organizer is taking action by spraying insecticide and installing insect repellent lights. Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura has also sought cooperation from insecticide maker Earth Corp.</p>

Despite improvements, the city fell short of the 1,400 lifeguards it needed to be fully staffed last year.</p>

Her influential book reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, and challenged many myths that were generated by men. It sparked legal reforms and widespread social change. While the book received high praise, it also drew criticism for its feminist dogma and generalizations about men.</p>
