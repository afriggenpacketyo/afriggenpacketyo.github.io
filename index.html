          <h2>Judge Dismisses Most Claims Against Celebrities in FTX Investor Lawsuit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 10:12:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed most claims against celebrities like Tom Brady and Steph Curry, who promoted the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The judge ruled that FTX investors failed to prove the celebrities knew enough about FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be liable for promoting the exchange. This lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, wiping out billions in customer funds. The plaintiffs alleged that the celebrities were paid millions to endorse FTX without disclosing their financial incentives, violating advertising laws.</p>

          <p>With gold prices soaring, financial advisors are offering differing opinions on whether investors should adjust their gold allocations. Some experts suggest increasing allocations to as much as 20-25% of a portfolio, especially amid global tensions and rising inflation. Others recommend maintaining traditional allocations of 10-15% for diversified portfolios. The best allocation depends on individual financial situations, risk tolerance, and economic outlook. Factors to consider include debt levels, inflation trends, currency strength, global instability, and time horizon.</p>

          <p>Britain is poised to announce a trade agreement with the United States, a move expected to provide some economic relief amid global uncertainty. While the full extent of the agreement is still unknown, it is likely to support sectors such as the auto industry and boost consumer and business confidence. However, economists caution that the deal may only generate a small boost for Britain, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services, which were not affected by higher tariffs. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, partially due to concerns about the economic impact of trade uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain has secured a trade agreement with the United States, a much-needed political victory and vindication of his strategy of cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement are not yet clear, but it is the first deal concluded with the United States after Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners. Starmer has maintained a close relationship with Trump, even avoiding criticism on trade and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut discusses the Democratic Party's response to the Trump administration and the need for a more urgent approach to protect democracy. Murphy argues that Democrats must credibly demonstrate how they will unrig the economy and address the social and cultural crisis in American life. He suggests that the party should be more tolerant of diverse views and focus on policies that benefit working-class families. Murphy acknowledges the challenges in connecting with religious voters but emphasizes the importance of addressing economic inequality and promoting social cohesion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent threat of a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America sparked concerns within the film industry. Although the tariff was later retracted, it highlighted the challenges Hollywood faces, including the movement of filming overseas for cheaper labor and tax incentives. While Hollywood remains a dominant force in moviemaking, the industry prefers tax credits to attract filmmakers back to America rather than tariffs, which could backfire and hurt global ticket sales.</p>

          <p>Governor Kathy Hochul is facing criticism for supporting changes to a law that requires private schools in New York to provide a basic education. This move is seen as an attempt to win over Hasidic voters, but critics argue it could weaken educational standards. The changes would primarily affect all-boys Hasidic schools, known as yeshivas, which have been accused of not providing adequate secular education. The legislation would delay consequences for non-compliant schools and make it easier for them to demonstrate compliance.</p>
