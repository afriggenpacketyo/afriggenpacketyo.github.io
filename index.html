          <p>The UK government is planning to double the time migrants must wait to qualify for permanent settlement, extending it from five to ten years. This new rule will apply to people already in the country and new visa applicants, and is subject to a public consultation. The government source said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is concerned about the increase in settlement and citizenship applications. While there will be shorter qualification periods for those who contribute significantly to the UK's economy and society, the move has been criticized by some as a cruel betrayal that will plunge many into deeper debt, uncertainty, and trauma. </p>

          <p>Reece Galbraith was sentenced to 14 years in jail after his illegal cannabis factory exploded, killing seven-year-old Archie York. The explosion, caused by a build-up of butane gas, obliterated several homes in Benwell, displacing dozens of residents. Galbraith admitted to two counts of manslaughter, while Archie's mother angrily confronted him in court, expressing the family's devastation. The court heard that Galbraith and Jason Laws, who also died in the blast, were making drug-infused sweets, ignoring clear warnings about the dangers of butane. </p>

          <p>A court ruled that the European Union should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Pfizer's CEO during negotiations for coronavirus vaccines. The court rejected the commission's argument that text messages are short-lived and do not contain important information. The New York Times hailed the ruling as a victory for transparency and accountability, emphasizing that ephemeral communications are not beyond public scrutiny.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's attacks on the courts follow a pattern of "court-baiting" seen in backsliding democracies, where leaders undermine public support for the judiciary by challenging them on popular but potentially illegal policies. This strategy puts judges in a difficult position, forcing them to choose between public backlash and eroding legal limits on executive power. By clashing with the judiciary on immigration, Trump is using a popular issue to challenge the courts and undermine their legitimacy. Examples from Turkey and Mexico illustrate how this tactic can weaken the judiciary and enable executive overreach. </p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, which, if confirmed, would be a tactical success but of uncertain long-term significance. While his death would undermine the group, analysts suggest it might not change Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations. The war's trajectory depends on both Israel and Hamas, with Israel seeking either a truce for hostages or Hamas's total defeat. The article argues that Israel's strategic incoherence makes it a bigger obstacle to a cease-fire than Hamas. </p>

          <p>Burberry announced plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of a cost-cutting initiative aimed at saving £60 million by 2027. The job cuts, impacting around 20% of Burberry's overall headcount, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its factory in Castleford, England. This move follows previous cost-cutting measures announced in November, bringing total estimated savings to £100 million. Despite a slight less than expected sales decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, analysts remain cautious about the pace of Burberry's turnaround. </p>

Golos, which documented election fraud, was labeled a "foreign agent" in 2013, and the charges relate to its past affiliation with a European election monitoring organization.

          <p>The article discusses the persistent assumption that mothers are the default parent, even when fathers are equally involved or designated as the primary contact. Studies show that schools and doctors' offices are more likely to contact mothers, regardless of parental preferences. This phenomenon can disrupt mothers' work and create frustration for fathers who want to be more involved. The article suggests that outdated systems and societal stereotypes contribute to the problem, hindering progress toward equitable parenting roles. </p>
