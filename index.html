          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer discussed the administration's new tariff policies, stating they are largely set and not open to immediate negotiation. He defended the strategy as a means to reshore manufacturing and reduce trade deficits, despite recent data showing a contraction in the factory sector. Greer also addressed the use of tariffs as a tool for geopolitical leverage, particularly concerning Canada and Brazil, asserting that such actions are within the president's legal authority. The conversation touched on ongoing trade talks with China, with Greer expressing cautious optimism about reaching an agreement to avoid a significant tariff increase. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's birth rate has fallen to a new low of 1.35 children per woman, sparking a debate about demographic decline and its societal implications. An author who wrote about her choice to be sterilized has faced public backlash, highlighting the tension surrounding female self-determination and traditional values. Sociologists connect the declining fertility rate to multiple crises, including the pandemic, climate change, and inflation, which create uncertainty for younger generations. Experts suggest the focus should be on bridging the 'fertility gap' by improving family-friendly policies like reliable childcare, rather than stigmatizing childless choices, to prevent long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with an amber weather warning issued for most of Scotland, indicating a potential danger to life from strong winds and damage to infrastructure. The storm, the sixth of the season, is expected to bring unusually powerful gusts of 50-70 mph inland and up to 90 mph in exposed areas on Monday. Forecasters warn that trees, currently in full leaf, are more susceptible to damage, increasing the risk of power outages and travel disruption. Officials have urged the public, including holiday travelers, to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary risks, with rail and ferry services already announcing cancellations and delays.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is set to consult on a massive compensation scheme for drivers who were mis-sold car loans, with potential costs estimated between £9 billion and £18 billion. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that particularly large commissions could create an unfair relationship between lender and borrower. The FCA stated the ruling provides clarity and that it will now determine eligibility for the payout scheme, which could begin next year. Most individuals are expected to receive less than £950, with the regulator advising consumers to contact their loan providers directly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former "Bachelor" stars Sean and Catherine Lowe have voiced their concerns about the widespread use of Ozempic for weight loss, describing the trend as "triggering" and "hard to watch." In an interview, the couple advocated for a more sustainable and healthier approach to wellness, emphasizing consistency in fitness and nutrition over quick fixes. They shared their personal strategy, which involves regular exercise and mindful eating habits developed in partnership with Atkins. The Lowes believe that while their method requires more time and commitment, it ultimately leads to a healthier overall lifestyle compared to what they see as the risky and restrictive nature of the Ozempic craze.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami star Lionel Messi left Saturday's Leagues Cup match against Necaxa in the 11th minute due to an apparent hamstring injury. The incident occurred around the eighth minute when Messi fell after a challenge, visibly frustrated before walking off the field for medical attention. Coach Javier Mascherano confirmed that Messi felt a pull and will undergo tests to determine the injury's severity, putting his availability for the upcoming match against Pumas UNAM in doubt. This adds to concerns about the 38-year-old's heavy workload this season, which recently led him to skip the MLS All-Star game due to fatigue.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has downplayed a public trade request from star defensive end Micah Parsons, attributing the social media post to negotiation tactics. The dispute arises from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would likely make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history. Jones insisted that an agreement had been reached in principle during the spring, a point Parsons seems to contest. Despite the public standoff and Parsons remaining out of practice with a back injury, Jones expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved, urging fans not to worry.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread anger by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing status quo agreement that permits non-Muslims to visit the holy site but not to pray there. Jordan, the site's custodian, condemned the visit as an "unacceptable provocation," while Hamas and the Palestinian Authority called it an act of aggression that crossed red lines. Ben-Gvir's visit, during which he was flanked by police, comes amid heightened tensions and his repeated calls for Israel to occupy all of Gaza and encourage Palestinian emigration.</p>

The revelation follows online debate over a new American Eagle ad campaign with the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great genes," which some critics linked to eugenics rhetoric. Conservatives defended the campaign as a target of "woke" cancel culture. This is not the first time the "Euphoria" star has been at the center of political speculation, following a 2022 incident involving guests at her mother's party wearing hats resembling MAGA merchandise.

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling monologues and factual inaccuracies, have renewed questions about his mental acuity. During a trip to the UK, he spoke unprompted about windmills, and he recently made a false claim that his uncle knew the Unabomber. Experts in psychology and psychiatry note that his tendency to digress, misremember facts, and engage in confabulation could be signs of cognitive decline. While the White House dismisses these concerns, critics point to a pattern of deteriorating verbal coherence compared to his earlier years, prompting calls for a more rigorous examination of his fitness for office.</p>

The ranking was based on factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, personal income, and the percentage of high-earning households.

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that specific language can be highly effective in managing children's tantrums by fostering connection over control. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate their emotions and help calm their nervous system. The approach emphasizes that tantrums are a sign of distress, not defiance. By providing reassurance and setting boundaries with compassion, parents can help children feel safe, which reduces the intensity of meltdowns and builds long-term emotional resilience.</p>

The scheme, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 young people into the country for free medical care, accompanied by a parent or guardian. This official initiative follows criticism from a Foreign Affairs Committee report and the efforts of private organizations like Project Pure Hope, which has already brought three Gazan children to the UK for treatment.

The philosophy, popularized by bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache and the book "Your Money or Your Life," centers on saving a significant portion of one's income to build an investment portfolio large enough to live off its returns. Adherents focus on distinguishing needs from wants and maximizing their savings rate, often aiming to accumulate 25 times their annual expenses.

Solnit points out that this violence is a constant, global pandemic that shapes women's lives and perpetuates inequality, rather than a series of exceptional events.

The Marine Mammal Stranding Center responded to the incident but was unable to immediately access the whale's carcass, which came to rest on a shallow sandbar. A necropsy is planned for Monday to determine the exact cause of death, once tidal conditions allow for the animal to be moved to a nearby state park.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Guangdong is taking "decisive" measures to combat a growing outbreak of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease. In the last week of July, the province reported 2,892 new cases, with the majority concentrated in the city of Foshan. The disease causes high fever, severe joint pain, and fatigue, but no severe or fatal infections have been reported so far. The head of China's national CDC has visited the area, urging swift efforts to contain the outbreak and safeguard public health as provincial authorities work to control the spread.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Sir Chris Bryant has publicly stated that he was sexually abused as a teenager in 1978 by Michael Croft, the late founder and head of the National Youth Theatre. In an interview, Sir Chris described how Croft, then 40 years his senior, invited him to his house and asked for sex, an encounter he felt powerless to refuse. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement expressing sorrow and solidarity with Bryant and other victims of the same perpetrator. Sir Chris, who is now 63, said he chose to share his story to help other survivors of abuse feel less alone.</p>

          <p>The use of AI by companies like Hertz to scan for and automatically bill customers for vehicle damage may soon expand to other parts of the travel industry, such as hotels. Experts describe this trend as "algorithmic auditing," where AI is deployed to identify and monetize previously overlooked losses, from scratches on a car to stains in a hotel room. While this can increase operational efficiency, it raises concerns about customer satisfaction and fairness, as algorithms may lack the contextual judgment of human employees. The key challenge for businesses will be balancing automation with trust, ensuring transparency and maintaining a human-in-the-loop for final decisions.</p>

Pirro's confirmation comes after President Trump withdrew his first nominee, Ed Martin Jr., who faced opposition over his support for the January 6 Capitol rioters. Pirro, who co-hosted "The Five," has significant courtroom experience but was also named in a defamation lawsuit by Smartmatic for spreading false claims about the 2020 election.</p>

A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Radar Online is challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file, with an appeal expected this fall. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a settled defamation case against Ghislaine Maxwell can be unsealed. These legal pressures offer a potential path to transparency, even as political efforts to disclose the records have stalled.</p>

The material was developed to solve a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after existing materials proved too brittle. The new steel must withstand both the extreme cold of liquid helium (near absolute zero) and the immense magnetic forces generated inside the reactor. The successful creation and deployment of CHSN01 in the world's first fusion power generation reactor this year marks a significant advancement for China in materials science.</p>
