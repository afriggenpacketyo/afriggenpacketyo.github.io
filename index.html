        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a 90-second radar and communication outage early Friday morning, marking the second such incident in recent weeks. The FAA reported that the outage occurred around 3:55 a.m. ET, affecting communication and radar displays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently unveiled a plan to modernize the country's air traffic control system, but the recent outages have increased pressure on officials and lawmakers to address the issues promptly. The controller on duty at Newark airport reported the outage to the pilot of a FedEx flight, and flights to and from Newark were delayed on Friday morning as a result of the outage.</p>

          <p>While tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, executives are expressing concerns about a potential slowdown in the digital advertising market due to trade tensions. Meta's CFO noted decreased spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters, while Alphabet and Pinterest shared similar sentiments regarding slower Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Snap went as far as to pull its second-quarter guidance, citing the unpredictable economy and potential shrinking corporate ad budgets.

          <p>This article explores the monthly costs associated with a $15,000 home equity loan in 2025, considering the current average interest rates. Home equity loans are presented as a relatively inexpensive way to borrow money, with rates lower than personal loans and credit cards. The article provides example monthly payments for 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year loan terms at the average rates available in May 2025. Alternatives to home equity loans, such as HELOCs, cash-out refinances, and reverse mortgages, are also discussed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly exploring a plan to bring Greenland into America's sphere of influence through a compact of free association (Cofa). This agreement would involve the U.S. providing essential services and military protection to Greenland in exchange for military access and duty-free trade. While this falls short of Trump's previous interest in acquiring the island, it reflects ongoing U.S. interest in Greenland's mineral deposits and strategic location. The plan faces hurdles, including the need for Greenland to separate from Denmark and potential skepticism from Greenlanders.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated openness to reducing tariffs on China to 80% as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepare for trade talks in Switzerland. This suggestion comes amid concerns about the impact of trade tensions on international markets and the global economy. However, the White House clarified that any tariff reduction would be contingent on concessions from China. Experts warn that an 80% tariff may still be too high to revive trade across the Pacific, and economists continue to raise concerns about a potential recession due to Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be released from immigration custody on bail while she challenges the revocation of her student visa. Judge William Sessions cited concerns about violations of Ozturk's First Amendment and due process rights, stating that her detention appeared to be based solely on an opinion piece she co-authored. The Trump administration claimed Ozturk's visa was revoked due to her involvement in associations that could undermine U.S. foreign policy. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her detainment was retaliation for her activism.</p>

The number of freight vessels and shipping containers headed to the U.S. from China has plummeted since the tariffs were announced. Trump has suggested a willingness to lower tariffs to 80%, but many businesses would still consider this rate extremely high.</p>
