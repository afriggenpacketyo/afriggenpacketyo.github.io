        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high-stakes summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded without a ceasefire agreement for the war in Ukraine. Key moments included a warm, red-carpet welcome for Putin, who has been largely shunned by Western leaders since the 2022 invasion. During their post-meeting statements, Putin alluded to needing "root causes" of the conflict addressed, while Trump vaguely mentioned "great progress" but offered no specifics and did not mention Ukraine. The meeting, which ended with Putin inviting Trump to Moscow, has raised more questions than it answered about the path to peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's government, under President Lai Ching-te, is implementing significant changes to its residency rules for individuals from mainland China. The new policy requires mainland nationals applying to live in Taiwan to provide notarized proof of having relinquished their household registration and passport in mainland China. This move is part of a broader strategy to address what Taipei views as escalating security risks from Beijing, including infiltration and identity ambiguity. The changes represent one of the most substantial shifts in cross-strait residency governance in recent decades.</p>

          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska did not yield a breakthrough on the Ukraine war, though Trump labeled the talks as "productive." Both leaders gave statements without taking questions, with Putin calling the talks a "starting point" and Trump mentioning that "many points were agreed on" without elaboration. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not included in the discussions, raising concerns in Kyiv about potential compromises on its sovereignty. Following the meeting, Trump advised Zelenskyy in an interview to "make a deal" with Russia.</p>

He declined to specify the main sticking point in negotiations, asserting that the next steps are up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European nations. Trump also confirmed he would be open to a trilateral meeting and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal."</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, marking the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect it to continue strengthening, potentially becoming a major hurricane over the weekend as it moves over the Atlantic. While not currently projected to make landfall in the United States, its path is being closely monitored. The storm is expected to pass north of the Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>A Bank of America strategist has highlighted a chart indicating that the stock market may be in a bubble, fueled by optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500's price-to-book ratio has reached a record high of 5.3, exceeding the 5.1 peak seen during the dot-com bubble in March 2000. While such high valuations reflect significant expectations for future AI-driven earnings, they do not definitively confirm a bubble. However, the data serves as a cautionary note to investors who believe the current market rally is fundamentally different from past speculative periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a Fox News interview following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump claimed that key points regarding a resolution to the Ukraine war, including potential land swaps, were "largely agreed on." When asked about how the war might end, Trump suggested that terms involving expanded Russian territory and U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine outside of NATO were negotiated. He described the three-hour meeting as "very warm" and stated that he and Putin were "pretty close to a deal." This specific claim adds a new dimension to the public understanding of the private talks.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a redistricting proposal aimed at giving their party an advantage in up to five U.S. House seats. This move is a direct response to a similar Republican effort in Texas, initiated at President Trump's urging, to redraw districts to favor the GOP. The California plan would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval in a special election. If passed, it could significantly reduce the number of Republican representatives from the state, potentially shifting the balance of power in Congress ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin concluded with no concrete deal on Ukraine, prompting analysis that the meeting was a strategic victory for the Russian leader. Putin was welcomed back onto the world stage on U.S. soil, yet he reiterated maximalist demands for ending the war, effectively signaling no change in his position. Trump's vague remarks about progress and his failure to secure any tangible concessions left allies in Europe and Ukraine guessing about what was discussed privately. The article characterizes the event as a "summit about nothing" that ultimately left Trump empty-handed while granting Putin legitimacy.</p>

Officials hope this new type of "starter home" will help address the state's severe housing crisis by providing more affordable options.

          <p>A new report indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers now suggest that efforts and funding might be more effectively spent on protecting people indoors with air filters and weatherization, rather than focusing solely on dust suppression projects.

          <p>Young people across England are reporting that the high cost of bus travel significantly impacts their budgets, ability to socialize, and financial independence. This comes as a report by MPs has recommended implementing free bus travel for everyone under the age of 22, similar to a policy already in place in Scotland. The BBC spoke with several young adults who spend a large portion of their income on daily commutes for work and education. They argue that the "extortionate" fares force them to cut back on essentials like food and prevent them from saving money or moving out of their family homes.</p>

          <p>At a VJ Day 80th anniversary commemoration, 104-year-old World War II veteran Capt Yavar Abbas delivered an emotional, off-script tribute that moved King Charles III and Queen Camilla to tears. During his address, Abbas saluted the King for attending the event despite his ongoing cancer treatment, also sharing that he himself is a cancer survivor. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman for the British Indian Army in the Burma campaign, later reflected on the futility of conflict. His journey from fighting in the war to witnessing the aftermath in Hiroshima has shaped his powerful anti-war message.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores to the UK High Street. After its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020, all stores were closed, but the brand was later purchased by online retailer Asos. Now, Topshop is aiming to recapture its former cultural relevance, hosting its first catwalk show in seven years and banking on millennial and Gen-Z nostalgia. Industry experts note the brand faces challenges in attracting new, younger shoppers and competing in a market dominated by fast-fashion giants and different consumer priorities.</p>
