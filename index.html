        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart's CFO John David Rainey indicated that despite recent agreements to lower tariffs on imports from China, consumers are likely to see price increases later this month. He explained that the magnitude of these increases is beyond what retailers or suppliers can absorb. While Walmart is working with vendors to mitigate the impact and plans to absorb some of the higher costs, Rainey noted the speed and magnitude of the price increases are unprecedented. The article also notes that Walmart is seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer due to its wide customer base. </p>

          <p>Despite recent efforts to crack down on online scamming operations in Southeast Asia, these syndicates continue to thrive and evolve. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that these crime networks are highly sophisticated and rapidly adopting new technologies. While some operations have been relocated, the industry continues to generate billions of dollars annually, relying on pre-existing criminal infrastructure and bribery. Singapore is taking a stand against scammers by implementing protective measures and awareness campaigns, and the UNODC is pushing for cross-border cooperation to combat these transnational crimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation has cooled, the prices of some everyday items, such as coffee and beef, are still soaring. Coffee prices have increased due to droughts in major producing regions like Vietnam and Brazil, limiting the global supply. Beef prices have risen due to a shortage stemming from drought conditions in 2022, which led to a reduction in the national beef herd. Additionally, car repair costs have increased due to the rise of high-tech vehicles and a shortage of skilled technicians, leading to higher compensation costs for repair companies. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his stance against birthright citizenship, arguing that the 14th Amendment was not intended to grant citizenship to children of those "taking vacations" in the U.S. He claimed the amendment was solely meant for children of formerly enslaved people and has nothing to do with illegal immigration. This statement comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether lower courts can issue national injunctions blocking executive actions, including those related to immigration. Trump signed an executive order earlier in the year challenging the longstanding interpretation of the 14th Amendment.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell by nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the drug crisis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Deaths declined across all major drug categories and in most states, marking the lowest tally since 2019. Experts attribute this decline to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, concerns remain about sustaining this progress, especially given proposed cuts to federal health programs addressing the drug crisis. Despite the decline, drug fatalities remain high, with over 80,000 deaths in 2024.</p>

Experts say medical schools need to update their technical standards to be more inclusive, as disabled physicians bring crucial perspectives to the profession.

Powell highlighted the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing a difficult challenge for the economy and central banks.

          <p>House Republicans, primarily from New York, are in conflict with party leadership over the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Some members want the cap raised or abolished, while others support a more modest increase, creating internal dissension. The issue is critical for Republicans in high-tax districts, as voters are concerned about the impact on their tax bills. A House committee approved a measure to raise the cap to $30,000, but the issue remains unresolved, highlighting the challenge of balancing fiscal constraints with voter concerns. </p>

          <p>Three large wildfires are burning out of control north of Duluth in northeastern Minnesota, fueled by near-critical fire weather conditions. The fires, which have spread across more than 37,000 acres, are being managed as the "Brimson Complex" by the Eastern Area Complex Incident Team. The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed numerous structures, cabins, and homes, prompting evacuations and relief efforts. Interactive maps are being used to track the fires' spread, and donations are being collected to support affected community members.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership, according to a new analysis from the National Association of Realtors. Only about 1 in 5 listed homes are affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, a significant drop from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing homes out of reach for middle-class buyers, particularly in cities with zoning restrictions. The lack of affordable housing is partly responsible for driving up prices, as buyers bid up prices to secure properties.</p>

          <p>The article reviews "Mission: Impossible â€” The Final Reckoning," noting the film's impressive stunts but criticizing its heavy reliance on exposition. While Tom Cruise delivers thrilling action sequences, the plot is weighed down by lengthy explanations and a lack of playfulness. The film suffers from an overabundance of flashbacks and flash-forwards, stifling the suspense. Despite its limitations, the movie is praised for Cruise's performance and Simon Pegg's portrayal of Benji, with underwater scenes and flight chases standing out as highlights.</p>

          <p>The Hanford nuclear site in Washington state, which produced plutonium for atomic weapons during World War II, left behind a legacy of 56 million gallons of highly radioactive waste. A cleanup operation, estimated to cost half a trillion dollars and last until 2100, has come under scrutiny following an exodus of experts from the Department of Energy (DoE). Concerns have been raised by politicians, environmental activists, and Indigenous communities about the impact of these staffing reductions on the cleanup efforts and the potential for a nuclear mishap. </p>
