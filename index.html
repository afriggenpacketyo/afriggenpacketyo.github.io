          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has filed a federal lawsuit against Alina Habba, the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey and former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, alleging false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation following an incident at an immigration detention center. The suit claims that Habba, motivated by political goals, instigated Baraka's arrest after he and three U.S. House members sought entry into the Delaney Hall facility for oversight purposes. Baraka asserts he was invited onto the property by an agent of the private company owning it, but Habba accused him of trespassing and ignoring warnings from Homeland Security Investigations. The suit follows Habba's announcement that her office would drop the case against Baraka. </p>

The agreement involves Meta buying approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy starting in June 2027, underscoring the critical role of reliable power sources for supporting AI infrastructure. The agreement points to the growing power needs of AI data centers, hence why portfolio names GE Vernova and Eaton â€” which both benefit from that trend â€” are also higher Tuesday on the news. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is publicly criticizing Republican senators, particularly Rand Paul, who are threatening to impede the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Paul opposes the bill due to its debt ceiling increase, which he believes will lead to excessive deficits, while Trump insists the bill will spur economic growth. Trump has been actively engaging with senators to garner support for the legislation, which extends the 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security while cutting Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. The bill is projected to add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed, triggering new elections, after Geert Wilders' far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) withdrew from the coalition due to disagreements over migration policy. Prime Minister Dick Schoof will lead a caretaker government until the elections, the date of which is yet to be determined. Wilders expressed frustration with the slow pace of implementing stricter immigration policies, including border closures for asylum-seekers and the deportation of dual nationals convicted of crimes, while coalition partners criticized his lack of seriousness. The collapse occurs shortly before the Netherlands is set to host a NATO summit, potentially impacting discussions on defense spending increases.</p>

          <p>Chin Chin, a well-known Chinese American restaurant in Los Angeles, will close its original location on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood on July 27 after nearly 50 years of operation.

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, Boston police officer Kelly Dever, a hostile witness for the defense, testified that she did not see key figures near Read's SUV, contradicting her previous statement to the FBI. Dever accused Read's defense team of pressuring her to lie, while the defense argued that Dever's testimony supported their theory of police corruption. Legal experts have divergent views on Dever's impact, with one calling her testimony a 'disaster' that helped the defense and another labeling her 'a profile in courage.' The defense aims to cast doubt on the investigation's findings, suggesting Read's SUV never struck the victim.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison for a murder he was wrongly convicted of due to the misconduct of former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell, the 51st person exonerated in a case involving Guevara, was initially a shooting victim who was then framed for an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify a suspect chosen by Guevara. While his murder conviction was previously overturned, a carjacking conviction remained until a judge vacated it, citing Guevara's pattern of misconduct.

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) has quietly paused a program that automatically issued Social Security numbers to legal immigrants, potentially disrupting the lives of millions. The Enumeration Beyond Entry program, initiated in 2017, streamlined the process by providing the SSA with information from work authorization or naturalization applicants. The halt, effective March 19, requires immigrants to apply separately at SSA offices, causing delays and complications for those needing a Social Security number to start jobs or open bank accounts.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a temporary pause on the garnishment of Social Security benefits for student loan borrowers in default. This decision reverses a policy that was implemented on May 5, which allowed the Education Department to collect overdue debts by garnishing federal payments, including Social Security checks. The department stated it is committed to protecting Social Security recipients, who often rely on fixed incomes, and will proactively reach out to recipients about affordable loan repayment options. The pause comes after a previous adjustment to clawback policies, reducing the amount taken from monthly checks to recover overpayments.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study suggests that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, may not be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea. The study found no significant difference in diarrhea symptoms between participants who took the medication preventatively and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues, its off-label use for prevention has been common, particularly among international travelers. The authors suggest further research may be needed to determine if there is a benefit in certain traveler groups or under specific circumstances.</p>

The organization also warned of a potential increase in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation possibly reaching 4% by the end of 2025.
