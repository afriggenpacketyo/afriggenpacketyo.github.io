          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting has intensified, with California's Democratic leadership backing the Texas Democratic legislators who left their state to block a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps. In Texas, Republicans are pursuing legal and financial penalties against the absent lawmakers, including seeking their removal from office and withholding their pay. This has prompted California to threaten retaliatory gerrymandering, creating a high-stakes, multi-state political battle over the future composition of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has welcomed Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting plan, vowing that California will take measures to "nullify" any GOP gains. California's legislature is preparing a ballot measure that would redraw its own congressional districts to favor Democrats if Texas proceeds with its plan, framing the move as a necessary defense of democracy. Polling indicates that California voters are currently undecided on the proposal, which would temporarily suspend the state's independent redistricting commission for the upcoming election cycles.</p>

          <p>A grassroots campaign known as "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents organizing to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. Volunteers gather daily at locations like Home Depot parking lots to provide information to day laborers and document the actions of federal agents. The movement reflects growing disapproval of the administration's deportation policies and aims to protect vulnerable community members. The effort highlights a shift from large-scale protests to smaller, localized actions focused on community defense and accountability.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are grappling with a significant blow to their offensive line after learning that star left tackle Rashawn Slater will miss the entire season due to a ruptured patellar tendon. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the news as a "gut punch," leaving the team to reconfigure its lineup just before the preseason. The injury forces rookie Joe Alt to move to left tackle and provides an opportunity for Trey Pipkins III to step into a starting role. The team is now exploring the free-agent market to add much-needed depth to the position.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska next Friday to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Trump suggested a potential deal could involve "some swapping of territories" to satisfy both nations, a politically sensitive proposal for Ukraine.

This would be the first U.S.-Russia summit since 2021, marking a significant development in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the NASA astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and was part of the first crew to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8, has died at the age of 97.

His calm handling of the crisis, famously summarized by the line "Houston, we've had a problem," became legendary.

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has reported an increase in complaints regarding the weight of models in ad campaigns. Activists and industry insiders worry that this trend reverses progress made by the body positivity movement and promotes harmful beauty standards. While retailers defend their models as healthy, critics point to styling and camera angles that they argue intentionally create an emaciated look.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that he currently cannot involve star striker Alexander Isak with the first-team group, signaling a deepening rift between the player and the club. The situation follows Newcastle's rejection of a £110m bid from Liverpool after Isak expressed a desire to leave. While Howe has not permanently closed the door on Isak's return, the Swedish international is currently training separately from his teammates. This development creates significant uncertainty for the club's attacking options just before the start of the Premier League season.</p>

          <p>New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates a rise in COVID-19 infections across the United States, with the highest levels concentrated in the western region. Wastewater surveillance, an early indicator of community spread, has risen to a "moderate" level nationally, with states like California, Alaska, and Nevada marked as "high." The increase is attributed partly to the new XFG "Stratus" variant and typical seasonal patterns of a summer spike. This developing wave comes as the Trump administration has moved to terminate contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, raising questions about future preparedness.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent decision to approve a plan to occupy Gaza City is driven by his reliance on his far-right coalition partners. This move is opposed by both the Israeli security establishment and a majority of the Israeli public, who favor ending the war with a hostage deal. Netanyahu's political survival depends on appeasing these hard-right parties, whose goal is to annex Gaza and establish settlements. This dynamic creates a significant gap between the will of the Israeli people and the actions of their government.</p>
