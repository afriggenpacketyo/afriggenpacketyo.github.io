          <p>Canada's Alberta province is grappling with rising separatist sentiment amidst a federal election, fueled by discontent with Liberal rule and US President Donald Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st US state. Some western Canadians are advocating for Alberta's independence or even joining the United States, citing cultural and economic alignment with their southern neighbors. This sentiment underscores a growing sense of "western alienation," with many Albertans feeling overlooked by politicians in Ottawa. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has warned of a "national unity crisis" if the province's demands are not met by the new prime minister.</p>

          <p>Google's browser chief testified that only Google can effectively run Chrome due to its deep integration with other Google services. Parisa Tabriz argued that Chrome's features, such as safe browsing and password breach notifications, rely on shared Google infrastructure. The Justice Department is seeking to force Google to sell Chrome as part of an antitrust case, but Google contends that separating Chrome would be technically infeasible and harm its functionality. A computer science expert for the Justice Department countered that Chrome could be easily transferred to another company without breaking its functionality.</p>
