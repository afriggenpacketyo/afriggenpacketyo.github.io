          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:10:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump described the agreement as "massive," claiming it includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars, trucks, and agricultural products. Japanese officials signaled their satisfaction with the outcome, which reportedly lowers the U.S. tariff on Japanese automobiles from 25% to 15%. The deal is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose coalition recently faced electoral setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed national sports governing bodies to align with a federal executive order that restricts transgender women from competing in women's sports. Citing its status as a federally chartered organization, the USOPC stated it has an "obligation to comply" with the policy, which threatens to rescind funding from non-compliant organizations. This move follows a similar decision by the NCAA and has drawn condemnation from civil rights groups like the National Women's Law Center, who argue the USOPC is sacrificing athletes' needs for political demands. The policy shift raises questions about its impact on local sports clubs and athletes across approximately 50 national governing bodies.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Automaker Stocks Surge Following Report of Lowered U.S. Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 21:02:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following reports of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The rally was fueled by news that the U.S. will lower its tariffs on imported Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%. This development is crucial for Japan's economy, as automotive exports to the United States constitute a substantial portion of its total shipments. The market's positive reaction underscores the relief felt by investors after a period of uncertainty over potential trade restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary piece suggests a trend of capitulation to political pressure from the Trump administration, citing the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" as a prime example. The article links the decision by parent company Paramount Global to a desire to appease the administration ahead of a major acquisition requiring federal approval. It also discusses the Republican-led House's move to recess early, thereby thwarting an investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, which has increasingly implicated President Trump. The author argues these events illustrate a broader pattern of media and political entities bending to the White House's will.</p>

A spokesperson for Obama issued a rare response, calling the allegations "bizarre," "ridiculous," and a "weak attempt at distraction."

The crisis is attributed to the depletion of food stocks and what aid organizations call vastly insufficient supplies being allowed into the region.

The photograph's widespread publication raised public awareness about the dangers of neglected fire escapes and directly led to regulatory changes in Boston.

However, the Justice Department swiftly responded by removing the newly installed prosecutor, accusing the judges of a "partisan" move to undermine the president's authority.

After its military service, the ship was sold and repurposed as a whaling vessel, hunting in the Arctic before it was wrecked in a storm off Sanday in 1788.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company has confirmed it will be raising prices on its candy products by a "low double-digit" percentage to offset the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price of cocoa has skyrocketed due to poor harvests in West Africa, driven by climate change and chronic underinvestment in farms. A company spokesperson clarified the increase is unrelated to trade policies but is a direct reflection of rising ingredient costs. In response, Hershey plans to focus more on its non-chocolate products, such as sweets and salty snacks, as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is deliberately purging women from the highest ranks of the U.S. military. The article points to the recent removal of Vice Admiral Yvette Davids, the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy, as the latest in a series of firings of high-ranking female officers. The author connects these actions to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's previously stated views on "social engineering" in the military. This trend, the author contends, sends a chilling message that women are not welcome in top leadership roles, despite their essential contributions to the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Findlay Curtis made a stunning impact for Rangers in his first competitive start under new manager Russell Martin. During the first leg of a Champions League qualifier against Panathinaikos, Curtis scored a spectacular opening goal to ease early tension at Ibrox. His dynamic play also led to a red card for an opposing player, shifting the momentum of the match decisively in Rangers' favor. Martin had expressed confidence in the young forward's character and talent, a belief that was validated by Curtis's crucial contribution to the team's vital 2-0 victory.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has issued disciplinary actions, including multi-year suspensions and expulsions, to dozens of students who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest that involved seizing a campus library in May. A student group reported that 80 students were punished, calling it the most severe disciplinary action for a single protest in the university's history. The move follows pressure from the Trump administration, which has penalized the university by canceling research grants over its handling of campus protests and alleged antisemitism.

          <p>The historic Royal Mile in Edinburgh, home to 72 tourist-focused gift shops, has become a focal point for concerns about overtourism's impact on local life. Residents claim the dominance of souvenir stores, many run by just a few operators, has displaced essential local businesses like grocers and butchers. This shift has made the area less livable for families, contributing to a decline in the local primary school's enrollment. While tourism supports tens of thousands of jobs, locals argue the city council has allowed the balance to tip too far, eroding the community fabric of the Old Town.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives abruptly ended its session and began its August recess early, a move Speaker Mike Johnson made to avoid a vote on a bipartisan bill to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The decision highlights the growing political pressure surrounding the Epstein scandal and the Republican leadership's struggle to manage the issue. The controversy has gained significant traction within President Trump's base, and the refusal to disclose more information has paralyzed some legislative functions. The move to recess is seen as a tactic to give the leadership breathing room from a difficult political situation.</p>

The company, a major supplier of semiconductors for the automotive and industrial sectors, projected revenue and earnings per share with midpoints below what analysts had anticipated.

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite network, intended to rival SpaceX's Starlink, is reportedly experiencing delays due to a significant shortage of available rockets. The project, led by Shanghai Yuanxin Satellite Technology, aims to deploy over 15,000 satellites by 2030 to provide global internet services. However, China's current rocket manufacturing and launch capacity is struggling to meet the high demand required to achieve its deployment milestones. To stay on schedule, the project would need to launch more than 30 satellites per month, a pace that is currently unattainable due to the launch vehicle bottleneck.</p>

          <p>A Boston court dismissed more than 120 criminal cases, including some involving assault, because the defendants could not be assigned a public defender within the legally mandated timeframe. The dismissals are the latest consequence of a months-long pay dispute, where public defenders have stopped taking new clients to protest what they argue are the lowest pay rates in New England. Despite prosecutors' objections, the judge was forced to drop the cases under a protocol designed to protect defendants' right to counsel. The situation highlights a critical public safety and due process issue stemming from the underfunding of the public defense system.</p>
