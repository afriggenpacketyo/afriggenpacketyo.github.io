        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by the American Association of Individual Investors reveals a significant spike in bearish sentiment, with over 43% of investors now negative on the stock market's six-month outlook. This 10-point increase in pessimism is the largest since the market top in February. Some market strategists, however, view this widespread uneasiness as a contrarian bullish indicator, suggesting that fearful investors have already sold positions and hold cash that could fuel a future rally. This negative sentiment persists despite a backdrop of strong corporate earnings and consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new set of "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous key trading partners, establishing a blanket 10% rate for most countries. However, some nations face significantly higher duties, with Brazil and India targeted with 50% tariffs due to specific U.S. government concerns. Neighbors Mexico and Canada are subject to levies of 25% and 35% respectively, while China faces a 30% tariff amid a temporary trade détente. Several other countries, including the U.K. and the E.U., have successfully negotiated trade frameworks to lower the impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's shares fell after President Donald Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, in a social media post. The demand follows concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, some allegedly linked to the country's military. Tan was appointed in March to lead a turnaround at the chipmaker, which has recently announced significant spending cuts to its foundry division and a slowdown of a planned factory in Ohio. The company has defended Tan, stating he is committed to U.S. national security.</p>

One drone flew deep into Lithuania carrying explosives before crashing, while another incident near Romania's border involved a Russian strike on a Ukrainian gas depot. Observers note a pattern of reckless incursions that have so far elicited a muted response from NATO. Lithuanian officials have called the events an "unprecedented and alarming incident," urging the alliance to bolster its air defenses against Russia's hybrid tactics.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates and Russia are deepening their strategic partnership, with UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and pledging to double their bilateral trade to over $20 billion within five years. This move highlights the UAE's diversified foreign policy, as it strengthens economic ties with Moscow while remaining a key U.S. ally. The UAE has not participated in Western sanctions against Russia and has become an important economic partner and safe haven for Russian businesses since the war in Ukraine began, a relationship that helps Russia counter economic isolation.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner represents a more direct abuse of authority than even President Nixon dared to commit. The author, a former director of the Nixon Presidential Library, contrasts Nixon's covert pressure on the BLS with Trump's public dismissal of its chief over a jobs report he deemed a "scam." The piece suggests this action demonstrates a dangerous erosion of institutional norms and a lack of self-constraint compared to the Nixon era, where staff often sought to control the president's impulses.</p>

The strategy, also known as debt settlement, involves negotiating with creditors to pay off a reduced portion of the total balance, often saving 30% to 50% before fees. However, it is a high-risk path generally suited for those in serious financial hardship, as it requires stopping payments, which severely damages one's credit score.

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the U.S. Commerce Department to conduct a "new and highly accurate CENSUS" that explicitly excludes undocumented immigrants from its count. In a social media post, Trump stated the new survey would be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents a renewed effort to alter the decennial count, which determines congressional representation and federal funding, and comes as Texas Republicans attempt to redraw their state's congressional map to favor their party.</p>

          <p>Shares of the language-learning platform Duolingo skyrocketed more than 30% after the company significantly raised its full-year revenue and bookings guidance.

          <p>This article discusses investment strategies amid the market volatility caused by President Trump's tariff policies. While history suggests long-term investors often benefit from staying invested, some strategists suggest tactical moves for those willing to look for them. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are presented as a way to adjust exposure to entire sectors or regions. Sectors like utilities and financials, which are more U.S.-based and service-oriented, are seen as less exposed to tariff impacts compared to materials and industrials that rely heavily on global supply chains.

The OPM director refuted the claims, stating that all such appointments are reviewed for compliance with merit system principles and that no one has been unlawfully "burrowed" into a career role.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's attacks on independent federal statistical agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), are counterproductive to its own economic goals. The author acknowledges that agencies like the BLS have flaws and need reform, particularly with declining survey response rates affecting accuracy. However, firing the commissioner and disbanding an expert advisory committee is seen as political retaliation, not genuine reform. The piece contends that a modern, data-driven economy requires credible, independent institutions to function effectively.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic makes the case that the societal decline in politeness, especially in online interactions, is detrimental to individual happiness and well-being. The author posits that being courteous—even when interacting with non-humans like AI bots—is a prosocial behavior that can elevate one's own mood and lower anger. The article suggests that consciously adopting habits of politeness, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with courtesy can serve as a powerful tool for improving personal mental state in an increasingly coarse culture.</p>

According to ICE, the "soft-sided" facility will serve as a short-term processing center for undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings. The use of military bases for detention has drawn criticism from some Democrats over its potential impact on military readiness.</p>
