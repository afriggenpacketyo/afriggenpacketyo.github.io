          <h2>Irish Museum Exhibit Reveals 1,300-Year-Old Monk Doodles with Everyday Complaints</h2>

          <p>A new exhibit at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts from the Abbey Library of St. Gall, featuring surprising doodles and notes from medieval monks. Scribed in Old Irish in the margins of a Latin grammar book, the annotations reveal the monks' very human frustrations, including complaints about hangovers, cold weather, and poor-quality ink. These rare scribbles offer a humorous and personal glimpse into the daily lives and personalities of monastic individuals in the 9th century, contrasting with the typically solemn image of their existence.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning advising citizens traveling abroad to be cautious when accepting souvenirs, suggesting they could be equipped with hidden surveillance technology. The agency stated that items like key rings or jewelry might contain cameras, listening devices, or trackers, potentially used by foreign spy agencies to leak state secrets. The warning specifically identified state sector workers, scholars, and students as prime targets for these "modified travel souvenirs," urging vigilance under the country's counter-espionage law.</p>

          <h2>Ukraine's New Prime Minister to Seek Additional IMF Financing for War Effort</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine's newly appointed Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely seek a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund to address the country's significant fiscal needs amid the ongoing war with Russia. With global donors having only committed about half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, fresh financing is critical. The discussions are expected to take place during an IMF review in August, as Ukraine's current loan program is set to expire in 2027 and defense spending needs remain substantial.

          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a £6.6 billion increase from the previous year and higher than anticipated by economists. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to increased spending on public services and debt interest payments, which have been driven up by inflation. This figure, the second-highest for June on record, intensifies pressure on the Chancellor, with analysts suggesting that tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary in the upcoming Autumn Budget to manage public finances.

China is known for altering endings and cutting scenes that portray the country negatively, and some studios have preemptively created self-censored versions to gain access to its lucrative market.

          <h2>Automakers Intensify Efforts to Commercialize Solid-State Battery Technology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The race to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Nissan targeting mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology, and are often called the "holy grail" for EVs. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a practical bridge technology, the industry faces challenges with production costs and durability. Recent breakthroughs in conventional battery technology from firms like CATL are also increasing the competitive pressure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Minnesota Twins, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to their closer, Tanner Scott. Scott left the game in the ninth inning with a forearm injury after grimacing in pain, and he is scheduled for an MRI. The game itself featured a strong performance from Shohei Ohtani, who pitched three solid innings and hit a two-run homer, and two solo home runs from Will Smith. However, the potential loss of Scott is a significant concern for the team's already injury-plagued pitching staff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly opened "Elvis Evolution" immersive experience in London has drawn sharp criticism from some attendees, who have labeled it "misleading" and "atrocious." Fans, who paid up to £300 for tickets, were reportedly expecting a life-sized AI hologram of Elvis, as suggested in early announcements. Instead, the show primarily uses upscaled archive footage and live actors, leading to complaints of being mis-sold and exploited. The creator, Layered Reality, defended the production, stating the concept evolved and that they made a creative decision not to mimic Elvis's iconic performances.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has threatened former president Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for violating a court-ordered social media ban. The ban was imposed as part of an investigation into allegations that Bolsonaro planned a coup, and it prohibits him from using social media, even through third parties. The warning came after allies circulated a video of a speech he gave to journalists, which the justice believes was intended for social media dissemination. Bolsonaro's lawyers have been given 24 hours to explain the potential breach of the court's restrictions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how U.S. President Donald Trump has increasingly used tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, often for objectives typically pursued through sanctions. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be deployed unilaterally and quickly, and they generate revenue, aligning with Trump's "America First" agenda. However, his administration has applied them to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, creating global trade tensions and market uncertainty. This blurring of economic tools raises concerns about the potential for destabilizing international relations and sparking retaliatory measures from key trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>San Francisco is moving to effectively ban homeless individuals from living in recreational vehicles by implementing strict new citywide parking limits. The policy, awaiting final approval, would restrict RVs over 22 feet long to two-hour parking unless they obtain a temporary permit. To be eligible for a permit, residents must have been registered with the city as of May and agree to work with outreach staff to find traditional housing. Critics argue the plan is cruel as it displaces people without guaranteeing sufficient housing, while supporters say it is necessary for street cleanliness and safety.</p>

          <p>North Korea has publicly announced its intention to build a third 5,000-ton destroyer for its navy, setting a completion deadline of October 2026. The plan was revealed at a rally at the Nampho Shipyard, where workers pledged to meet the deadline to support the ruling party's goal of building a powerful military. This announcement follows the launch of the nation's first destroyer of this class in April and the capsizing and subsequent repair of a second one in May.

Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the government aims to restore trust after thousands were infected with HIV or hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products. Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a victim's estate if they die before their claim is settled.
