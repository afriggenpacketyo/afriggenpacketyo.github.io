          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was suspended after he falsely claimed that Charlie Kirk's killer was right-wing, relying on misinformation from liberal media. Kimmel's comments sparked outrage, leading to calls for action against ABC and Disney, with the FCC chair suggesting the network misled the public about a significant political event. Polling data indicates that a significant portion of Americans, particularly Democrats, incorrectly believe the shooter was a Republican, highlighting the impact of media narratives. The article suggests Kimmel is a victim of liberal media lies and conspiracy theories, while Kimmel himself is angry about his show being suspended as a result of his false claims. The author believes that conservatives are buckled up and the only person pantless is Jimmy Kimmel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips, bolstering Intel's turnaround efforts which already include investments from the U.S. government and Softbank. Intel shares surged following the news, which is seen as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing. The collaboration will involve Intel building x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX GPUs for PCs. The investment does not currently include Nvidia manufacturing its chips with Intel's foundry, raising questions about the extent of the collaboration.</p>

One of the teenagers was already on bail for previous ransomware hacks and is now also charged with targeting US healthcare companies. The hack compromised personal information of approximately 5,000 TfL customers, including bank account details and addresses.</p>

          <p>A study examines the stability of gender identities in young children who have transitioned, a practice that gained traction in the early 2010s. Social transition, involving living in a new gender without medical intervention, was initially controversial for minors but has become more accepted. The article explores the evolving understanding that trans children have a clear sense of their identity, leading to earlier transitions. The research investigates the long-term outcomes and potential reversibility of these transitions in young children.</p>

          <p>A coalition of attorneys general are opposing the Trump administration's proposed regulation that could narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The attorneys general argue the vagueness of the regulatory language will lead to uncertainty regarding which employers are eligible for PSLF. They also believe it would grant the Trump administration broad authority to exclude programs it doesn't approve of. The executive order could halt loan forgiveness for employees of organizations involved with "illegal immigration, human smuggling, child trafficking, pervasive damage to public property and disruption of the public order".</p>

The incident has raised concerns about press freedom in the US, particularly in light of proposed changes to journalist visa validity.

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper warns that the Federal Reserve risks triggering inflation and asset bubbles if it cuts interest rates too aggressively. While acknowledging that a few more rate cuts may be warranted, Tepper believes further easing could weaken the dollar and fuel excessive demand. He noted high valuations but said he wouldn't bet against stocks with the Fed still in easing mode. Tepper's remarks underscore concerns about the potential consequences of overly accommodative monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's suspension after comments about Charlie Kirk reflects a broader trend of government-backed censorship and corporate capitulation to political pressure, according to this article. The author argues that the Trump administration is using Kirk's death as a pretext to silence dissent, targeting Kimmel for violating conservative sensibilities. The article highlights the importance of free speech, even when it is distasteful to those in power, and warns against the erosion of fundamental American rights. The author says that this is the road to totalitarianism, and it does not end with one man losing his television show.</p>
