          <p>Jay Inslee argues that the United States is passively sleepwalking into totalitarianism as Donald Trump dismantles democracy, criticizing the silence and lack of resistance from institutions like colleges, law firms, and media companies.

Inslee calls for a united rebellion against Trump's actions, asserting that the current passivity and lack of resistance are enabling the erosion of democratic principles.

          <p>A severe ice storm in northern Michigan has caused widespread damage, snapping trees and disrupting power for thousands, and the repercussions are expected to persist for months or even years. Approximately 3 million acres of trees were affected, and the Mackinac Bridge was closed for the longest period since the 1950s due to falling ice. Climate experts suggest that a warming atmosphere could increase the frequency of severe freezing rain events in certain regions, while areas that currently experience ice storms may see them less often in the future. The cleanup efforts are expected to take months, and the drying lumber poses a wildfire risk.</p>

          <p>Sibling relationships, often among the most enduring in a person's life, undergo significant transformations as individuals age and their lives diverge. While some siblings transition from close roommates to cherished friends, others may find themselves drifting apart due to varying interests, life paths, and family dynamics. Maintaining these relationships in adulthood requires intention and effort, and it's not necessarily a negative outcome if siblings aren't exceptionally close. Factors such as childhood experiences, cultural expectations, and family norms influence the level of affection, ambivalence, and ambiguity that characterize these bonds.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney, has won the recent election, marking a significant turnaround amid threats and tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Carney emphasized the need for unity and resilience in the face of Trump's attempts to undermine Canada. He presented himself as the most experienced leader to navigate the crisis, stressing the importance of preparing for the worst-case scenario. The election results indicate division in the country, posing a challenge for Carney as he aims to lead Canada through a trade war with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Canadian Conservative Party, has lost his seat in parliament, a blow that coincides with the Liberal Party's victory in the national election. Poilievre's defeat follows a campaign dominated by Trump's trade tariffs and threats against Canada, which shifted the political landscape. Despite conceding the election to Carney, Poilievre described the results as a "virtual tie" and called for Canadians to hold the government accountable. Poilievre struggled to distance himself from Trump, who has previously praised the U.S. president but sought to highlight their differences after Trump intensified his trade war.</p>

The company's organic revenue increased 6% during the quarter, boosted by higher prices on its drinks, with unit case volume growing 2% due to growth in India, China, and Brazil.</p>

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about President Trump's economic policies, suggesting they are failing to deliver on promises of economic growth and lower inflation. His signature policies on trade, immigration, and government spending are contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to reignite inflation. The helter-skelter approach to tariffs has been challenging for businesses, leading to fears of empty shelves and rising prices. While the White House defends its economic record, critics point to a potential recession and growing skepticism among consumers about Trump's ability to tackle inflation.</p>

While acknowledging structural differences as a primary cause of US-China tensions, they view Trump as a symptom rather than the sole cause.
