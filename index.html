        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the reasons why some seniors prefer Medigap despite Medicare Advantage's lower premiums and extra perks. Key factors include the freedom to see any doctor accepting Medicare nationwide, more predictable out-of-pocket expenses for chronic conditions, and fewer administrative hurdles like prior authorizations. The choice ultimately depends on an individual's health needs, travel habits, and financial situation, balancing Medigap's stability against the bundled benefits often found in Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

New CEO Philipp Navratil is accelerating a cost-savings program to 3 billion Swiss francs by 2027, aiming to turn the company around after a turbulent year that saw leadership changes.

          <p>The British government has once again delayed its ruling on China's proposal to build a massive new embassy near the Tower of London, pushing the deadline to December. The planned 20,000-square-meter complex, which would be Europe's largest, has sparked significant controversy and security concerns. Opponents, including pro-democracy activists and local residents, fear the embassy's proximity to London's financial district could facilitate espionage and be used to harass political dissidents.</p>

          <p>Four months after U.S. strikes against Iranian military targets, which critics warned could trigger a wider conflict, the Middle East is experiencing a period of relative quiet. Proponents of a more assertive foreign policy now argue that the decisive action successfully restored deterrence, leading to reduced attacks from Iranian proxies and culminating in a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While some analysts maintain the strikes were a diplomatic gamble that undermined trust, others credit the show of strength with preventing further escalation from Tehran.</p>

          <p>Daniel Duggan, a former U.S. Marine pilot, is appealing an Australian court's decision to extradite him to the United States on charges of illegally training Chinese military aviators. Prosecutors allege that over a decade ago, Duggan provided instruction on aircraft carrier landings to Chinese pilots without the required license, receiving payments totaling around $61,000. Duggan, who denies the allegations and claims he is a political pawn, has been held in a maximum-security prison since his 2022 arrest in Australia.</p>
