          <p>Alibaba's prestigious AI research lab, the Damo Academy, is facing a significant talent drain as key researchers depart for domestic competitors. Senior figures from the Tongyi AI model team, such as Yan Zhijie and Bo Liefeng, have recently been hired by rivals JD.com and Tencent, respectively. This trend highlights the intense competition for top-tier expertise within China's rapidly advancing artificial intelligence sector. The departures underscore the high value placed on experienced AI professionals as companies race to develop their own foundational models.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, employees have revealed a pervasive atmosphere of fear, stating the attack was not entirely unexpected. The article connects the violence to a years-long escalation of hostility and threats against public health officials, fueled by political rhetoric and misinformation. Staff members expressed feeling abandoned by the current administration, citing budget cuts, layoffs, and verbal attacks from leadership. The incident has left the workforce feeling unsafe in a place they once considered a secure environment for scientific work.</p>

Their return marks the end of a mission that began when they relieved two NASA astronauts who were stranded on the station for nine months due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule. The successful splashdown, managed by SpaceX, was NASA's first in the Pacific in 50 years. Officials praised the mission's success and the crew's well-being upon their return after 146 days in orbit.</p>

          <p>As the Lee Fire continues to spread in northwestern Colorado, authorities have evacuated 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center. The Colorado Department of Corrections confirmed the inmates were safely transferred to other secure facilities away from the fire-affected region. The wildfire has burned over 92,000 acres and is only minimally contained, prompting wider evacuation orders in two counties. The evacuated prison is a minimum-security facility located in a rural area now threatened by the advancing flames.</p>

          <p>A late-night shooting in New York City's Times Square left three people injured, leading to the arrest of a 17-year-old suspect. The incident reportedly began as a fight among a group of teenagers inside a restaurant before spilling onto the street, where shots were fired. A 19-year-old man was the intended target, but a 65-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman were also wounded as innocent bystanders. Police quickly apprehended the suspect and recovered a weapon, charging the teen with attempted murder and other offenses.</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry is experiencing a significant slowdown after a period of booming sales and premiumization that followed the 2008 recession. A combination of factors, including inflation, changing drinking habits among younger generations, and the looming threat of retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada, has dampened the market. This economic pressure has led to an oversupply of bourbon, falling sales for major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey, and bankruptcies among smaller distilleries. Analysts warn that the industry, once a hot market for investors, may face further consolidation and closures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused the university of breaching legal requirements and initiated a "march-in" process that could allow the government to take ownership of the intellectual property. This action is viewed by critics as the latest move in a politically motivated campaign against the university, which the administration has accused of failing to adequately address antisemitism.

One brand, Trip, had an advertisement banned for making unauthorized health claims about stress and anxiety.

The article explores how "Irishness" is an evolving concept, encompassing a wide spectrum of influences from politics in Northern Ireland to the arts.

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's World War II atomic bomb commemorations for the first time could create friction in the cautiously improving relationship between Tokyo and Beijing. Lee Yi-yang, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, was present at ceremonies in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While Japan does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, the move is part of the island's broader effort to raise its international profile. Observers believe Beijing will view the high-level presence unfavorably, posing a delicate diplomatic test for both Asian powers.</p>

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign nationals upon receiving a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, criminals with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with the destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government claims this will save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. The plan would not apply to those with life sentences, and the opposition has criticized it as unworkable.</p>

          <p>Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has publicly questioned UEFA, European football's governing body, over its social media tribute to a deceased Palestinian footballer, Suleiman al-Obeid. The Palestinian Football Association reported that al-Obeid, known as the "Pele of Palestinian football," was killed in an Israeli attack while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza. UEFA's tribute praised his talent but omitted any details about his death, prompting Salah to post, "Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?"

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, recommending them as a key fruit for people over 50 to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these neuroprotective effects may help protect the brain from proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fresh fruit can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract is a year-round alternative, though consumers should avoid versions with added sugar.</p>
