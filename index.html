            <p>Following the Taliban's ban on girls' education, many Afghan girls are turning to low-paid carpet weaving to support their families. The carpet industry, dominated by women, is booming, but weavers earn meager wages despite long hours. The lack of opportunities and dire economic situation force many into this laborious work. While the Taliban claims to be working on allowing girls to return to school, no concrete steps have been taken.</p>

            <p>Nissan will cut Japanese production of its top-selling U.S. model, the Rogue SUV, from May to July due to new U.S. import tariffs. The automaker plans to reduce output by 13,000 vehicles at its Kyushu plant, affecting workers' hours. This move reflects the impact of President Trump's 25% levy on cars built overseas, which has disrupted the global automotive supply chain. Nissan is reviewing its production and supply chain operations to adapt to market changes.</p>

            <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a key mechanism by which breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and proliferate. The research suggests that targeting arginine metabolism could offer a new approach to precision therapy for breast cancer. The findings reveal that the metabolic interplay between cancer cells and macrophages plays a dominant role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression, potentially opening avenues for starving tumors of this essential protein building block.</p>
