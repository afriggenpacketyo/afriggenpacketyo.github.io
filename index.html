          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster." His comments, made on Truth Social, followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for a summit. Trump claimed India's high tariffs prevent U.S. businesses from selling goods there, exacerbating a trade imbalance. This criticism comes amid already strained relations, with the U.S. having imposed significant tariffs on India, partly due to its purchase of Russian oil. The article highlights the ongoing friction over trade policies and geopolitical alignments, contrasting with India's strengthening ties with China.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a long-serving Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, emphasizing the need for "generational change" within the party. Nadler, 78, stated that his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older political figures, citing the need for younger leadership to confront Donald Trump. First elected in 1992, Nadler has had a significant career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as an impeachment manager during Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up his seat and reflects a broader conversation within the Democratic party about leadership transition.</p>

          <p>A minivan drove into a crowd at the Kipona festival in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, injuring three people, including one child. The incident occurred as the three-day festival was concluding on Monday evening. According to the Harrisburg Bureau of Police, a woman driving the vehicle maneuvered around barricades and parked cars before striking the attendees. Fortunately, police reported that none of the injuries sustained by the two adults and the child were believed to be life-threatening. The driver's motives and the exact circumstances leading to the crash are currently under investigation by local authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar showed signs of a weak recovery in Asian trading after experiencing five consecutive days of losses. The decline is attributed to investor concerns over President Trump's criticisms of the Federal Reserve, which have raised fears about the central bank's independence. As U.S. markets prepared to reopen after the Labor Day holiday, traders shifted towards safe-haven assets like gold, which neared record price levels. Upcoming U.S. economic data, including manufacturing indices and the non-farm payrolls report, will be closely watched to gauge the impact of recent policies on the economy.

          <p>Chinese state media has hinted that new, improved versions of the YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles could be featured in an upcoming military parade in Beijing. A military commentator on the state broadcast network CCTV specifically discussed an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which would allow bombers to strike targets from outside enemy air defense zones with enhanced penetration capabilities. While China has not officially confirmed the missile is in service, its potential development signals a move towards a versatile family of land, sea, and air-launched hypersonic weapons.

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets posted gains as investors evaluated the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit while weighing ongoing tariff uncertainties. The market movement followed a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw increases, with South Korean inflation data showing a slower rise than anticipated. In contrast, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined ahead of the release of its current account balance data, reflecting a mixed but generally positive sentiment across the region's financial markets.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has used advanced facial recognition technology to analyze a photograph of a corpse found in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, suggesting a "high probability" that it is the body of revered Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr. Sadr mysteriously vanished in Libya in 1978, leading to decades of speculation. The algorithm, developed at Bradford University, compared the photo with images of Sadr, yielding a score indicating a strong familial or direct match. This evidence supports the theory that Sadr was killed shortly after his disappearance, potentially under the orders of then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, and could provide a major breakthrough in a nearly 50-year-old mystery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters has uncovered a hidden mathematical pattern in the timeline of Earth's major geological events. Researchers found that the boundaries between geological periods, such as mass extinctions and evolutionary booms, are not random but follow a multifractal logic, forming hierarchical clusters separated by long periods of calm. This suggests that Earth's system changes are deeply structured. The study concludes that understanding the full range of the planet's potential variability, including sudden upheavals, requires analyzing geological records spanning at least 500 million years, offering new insights for modeling both past and future planetary changes.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights a growing trend among some intellectuals who are drawing parallels between the current state of Western countries, particularly Britain, and the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The comparison centers on perceived political rigidity, an unwillingness to question obsolete dogmas, and a managerial class that seems to be ignoring impending systemic changes. While the accuracy of this historical analogy is debatable, the author argues that the mere discussion warrants serious attention. The piece suggests that a decline of the West, even short of a full collapse, would have profound and serious consequences for the entire world, making such internal critiques significant.</p>

Tidball has given evidence to the House of Commons Modernisation Committee, which is reviewing how to improve the situation.

The Justice Department contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families and the Guatemalan government, but the judge cited the hurried nature of the plan over a holiday weekend as justification for the extraordinary measure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has warned that a planned $15 trillion in U.S. investment would be "immediately cancelled" if the courts are allowed to strike down his tariff policies. His statement on Truth Social followed a U.S. appeals court ruling that deemed his broad use of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act unconstitutional. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for this record investment and that their termination would turn the U.S. into a "Third World Nation." The court's decision, which focuses on the limits of executive authority rather than the economic impact of tariffs, is set to take effect on October 14, pending a potential Supreme Court appeal.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of Liverpool's unprecedented £415 million summer transfer spending, which set a new record for a single club in one window. This shift in policy is attributed to a combination of factors, including restrained spending in previous years, significant commercial growth, and a desire to capitalize on their recent Premier League title success. The club's major acquisitions, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak, were aimed at evolving the team's style of play under manager Arne Slot. The spending spree was also tragically influenced by the need to replace beloved forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash.</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is earning early Oscar buzz for his dramatic portrayal of UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after years of feeling pigeon-holed as a blockbuster action star. Directed by Benny Safdie, the film explores Kerr's career, his struggles with substance abuse, and his relationship with his girlfriend, played by Emily Blunt. Early reviews have praised Johnson's performance as a "revelation," highlighting his sincere and ego-less transformation in a significant departure from his typical roles.</p>

Nestle stated the relationship represented a conflict of interest and that the decision was necessary to uphold the company's strong values and governance. Freixe, who had been with the company for nearly 40 years, will not receive an exit package. Philipp Navratil has been appointed as his successor.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian nations including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a joint development bank. The initiative is aimed at insulating member countries from the risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system and accelerating key infrastructure projects within the region. According to analysts, creating this financial institution is a logical step for the bloc to enhance its economic sovereignty and deepen cooperation. The move reflects a broader trend among non-Western powers to create alternative financial structures that reduce their reliance on Western-led institutions and currencies.

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The announcement came two days after Giuliani, his longtime political ally and former personal lawyer, was seriously injured in a car crash. Trump praised Giuliani as the "greatest Mayor in the history of New York City" and a great patriot. The decision is notable given Giuliani's recent history, which includes being disbarred and criminally charged for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, creating a stark contrast with his earlier reputation as "America's Mayor" after 9/11.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil's features differ from both Neanderthals and modern humans, strengthening the theory that it belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species considered a common ancestor. This new dating suggests that more primitive human populations coexisted with the emerging Neanderthal lineage in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of the human evolutionary timeline.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the UK in the coming days. The heightened visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the celestial display further south than is typical. While northern regions like Scotland and Northern Ireland will have the best views, sightings may be possible as far south as the Midlands. Visibility will depend on clear, dark skies away from city light pollution. The best opportunity for viewing is expected on Monday night.</p>

          <p>The recent transfers of strikers Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, who both reportedly refused to train to force their moves, have ignited a debate about player power in football. This article contrasts their successful tactics with the case of Marc Guehi, who remained professional at Crystal Palace but saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse. Commentators are divided, with some calling the players' actions "despicable," while others argue clubs are often "hypocritical," as they show little loyalty when deciding to sell players. The incidents raise questions about whether forcing a move is becoming a necessary, albeit controversial, strategy for players seeking to control their careers.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why President Donald Trump has refrained from imposing harsher sanctions on Russia despite its continued aggression in Ukraine. Analysts suggest two primary factors are at play: Trump's desire to be seen as a peacemaker who can broker a deal, and strategic concerns within Washington about pushing Russia into a closer alliance with China. A completely isolated Russia could grant China unprecedented access to energy, military technology, and Arctic resources, strengthening Beijing's global position. This strategic hesitation leaves Ukraine in a difficult position, waiting for the U.S. to apply the promised economic pressure on Moscow to compel peace negotiations.</p>
