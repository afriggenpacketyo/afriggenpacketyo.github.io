          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $329 million in damages, finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The incident occurred when a Model S accelerated through an intersection, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' lawyers argued that Tesla irresponsibly marketed the technology's capabilities, leading to misuse on roads for which it was not designed. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, which could set a significant precedent for numerous other lawsuits concerning its automated driving systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, a career civil servant, following the release of a disappointing jobs report. The report showed only 73,000 jobs were added in July, and it included significant downward revisions for May and June, indicating a notable hiring slowdown. Trump baselessly accused the commissioner of faking statistics in a social media post announcing the dismissal. The move raises concerns about the politicization of federal data agencies and economic reporting.</p>

The move follows an escalating war of words, with Medvedev warning of a "dead hand" threat, a reference to Russia's retaliatory nuclear strike system. Trump stated he acted in case the inflammatory comments were more than just words, highlighting the severe tensions amid his ultimatums for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Emmanuel Macron's announcement that France will recognize a Palestinian state has created deep divisions within the country, particularly between its large Jewish and Muslim communities. Jewish groups have criticized the move as a "diplomatic error" that rewards Hamas, while many Muslim leaders have welcomed it with satisfaction. The decision marks a significant shift in French policy, reportedly influenced by the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. This diplomatic U-turn has intensified concerns about the fraying relationships between the two faiths, both of which have seen a rise in targeted attacks since the conflict began.</p>

This stance is a direct response to criticism from colleagues like Justice Elena Kagan, who contend that courts have a duty to explain their reasoning to the public.

          <p>In a highly unusual mid-game trade, infielder José Caballero was dealt from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees while the two teams were playing against each other. Caballero started the game for the Rays, turning a double play in the fifth inning and batting in the sixth, before being informed of the trade. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Tampa Bay teammates in the dugout during the seventh inning. Caballero, who is tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases, expressed his gratitude to the Rays and his honor in joining the Yankees.</p>

          <p>A surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new jobs and major downward revisions for previous months, confirms a significant market slowdown. Economists state the U.S. is not adding enough jobs to keep pace with population growth, effectively a contraction. Factors contributing to the weakness include business uncertainty from tariff policies, reduced immigration, and federal spending cuts. With the national hiring rate near a decade low and labor force participation falling, the data paints a picture of a stagnant job market.</p>

          <p>Wildlife groups have condemned the killing of a collared lion named Blondie by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe, drawing parallels to the infamous 2015 killing of Cecil the lion. Blondie was part of an Oxford University research project and was reportedly lured out of a protected national park with bait before being shot. Zimbabwe's national parks agency defended the hunt as legal, stating the hunter had the necessary permits and that hunting revenue is crucial for conservation. Critics argue the killing makes a mockery of hunting ethics, as the lion wore a visible research collar and was a prime breeding male.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell despite beating most second-quarter earnings expectations, as investors were underwhelmed by cloud growth and future profit guidance. A key takeaway was the company's increased capital expenditure forecast, now potentially exceeding $118 billion for the year, primarily to support AI infrastructure. While Amazon Web Services revenue grew 18%, it trailed the growth rates of rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The company appears to be managing the impact of U.S. tariffs better than feared, with strong online sales growth suggesting consumer demand remains healthy. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect, Jon Ruben, has been remanded into custody and is scheduled to appear in court. The police watchdog is also investigating the force's handling of the incident.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new 50% tariffs on many Brazilian imports and has sanctioned Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes for alleged human rights abuses. The U.S. cited the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, as a reason for the punitive measures. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the move as "unacceptable imperialist aggression" and an attack on the country's sovereignty. Analysts suggest the actions are politically motivated, tied to U.S.-China geopolitical competition and support for ideological allies like Bolsonaro.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK motorists have been denied a path to compensation for hidden commissions on car loans after a Supreme Court ruling. The court sided with finance companies in two of three key test cases, reversing earlier rulings and narrowing the scope for large-scale claims similar to the PPI scandal. However, many drivers who had a specific type of loan called a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA) before 2021 may still be eligible for payouts. The UK's financial regulator is considering a formal redress scheme for those affected by DCAs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, credit card APRs remain near record highs, keeping debt forgiveness a relevant strategy for struggling borrowers. With the average credit card APR near 22%, interest charges compound quickly, making it difficult for consumers to reduce balances that now average $8,000. Debt forgiveness can reduce the principal amount owed, offering more immediate relief than waiting for potential future rate cuts, which may be marginal and slow to materialize. The article suggests this approach is most sensible for those already behind on payments or at risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The adoption of artificial intelligence by employers led to over 10,000 job cuts in the U.S. in July alone, according to a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. AI is now listed as one of the top five reasons for job losses in 2025, with the tech sector being hit particularly hard. Since 2023, over 27,000 job cuts have been directly attributed to AI, reshaping the labor market and reducing entry-level corporate roles. The report also notes that federal budget cuts and tariffs are contributing to the highest number of private-sector job cut announcements since 2020.</p>
