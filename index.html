          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The penalty includes Â£104.5 million for sewage-related breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for this reason. Thames Water, serving a quarter of the UK's population, faces criticism for sewage discharges and a Â£20 billion debt, but recently secured a Â£3 billion emergency loan to avoid collapse. The regulator emphasized that the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, as Thames Water continues to grapple with performance issues and financial instability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has urgently appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a judge's mandate imposing due process procedures for immigrants facing deportation to third countries. Solicitor General John Sauer argues that Judge Brian Murphy's order, requiring notice and a waiting period for detainees to raise safety concerns, creates a "diplomatic and logistical morass." The administration insists it complies with international law regarding the Convention Against Torture. The Supreme Court, which has previously affirmed the right to due process for non-citizens, is now considering the extent to which individual judges can issue nationwide orders impacting government policy, as the administration pushes for aggressive removals of unlawful immigrants.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns regarding the government's plans to release some prisoners early to ease overcrowding. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they warned that the proposals "could be of net detriment to public safety," citing potential costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail time. While acknowledging the government's challenges with prison overcrowding, Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley noted the proposed solutions would increase police workload. The government maintains that its announced proposals address many of the concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences and terrorists ineligible for early release.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine is visiting Berlin for his third meeting in as many weeks with Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz, underscoring Merz's focus on the war in Ukraine. This visit highlights Merz's efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies, especially as U.S. support for NATO weakens. Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly the Taurus missile system, as Ukraine seeks to bolster its defense capabilities. Merz's proactive engagement contrasts with the previous chancellor's cooler relationship with Zelenskyy, signaling a strengthened commitment from Germany to support Ukraine amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan recommends decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use. The London Drugs Commission's report, led by Lord Falconer, suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA). Khan supports the findings, arguing that current rules "cannot be justified," while critics like David Raynes warn it could wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful. The report also proposes improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis, with a reassessment of broader legalization in five years.</p>

Recent polls indicate a neck-and-neck competition, leading to intense campaigning by both the center-left ruling coalition and the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Trzaskowski held a "March of Patriots" rally, while Nawrocki organized a "March for Poland" with the slogan "Poland first." Ultra-right politician Slawomir Mentzen, who came third in the first round, is attempting to leverage his support for the 2027 parliamentary election, as both candidates navigate a tense political landscape.</p>

This affects refugees who are allowed to stay in Germany due to potential persecution or death sentences in their home countries, with exemptions for urgent cases.

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting individuals suspected of smuggling Pop Mart toys, including Labubu and Molly dolls, as prices increase due to the Beijing-based retailer's global expansion. Customs agents have seized undeclared toys from travelers allegedly intending to resell them for profit. Pop Mart, which has expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries, sees lower prices for its sought-after toys overseas due to currency fluctuations and local discounts. This has led to travelers buying the toys abroad and bringing them back into China, creating a lucrative smuggling market.</p>

While some customers joked about the technology, others expressed privacy concerns and vowed to avoid self-checkouts.

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing anxiety over potential capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades as long-dated yields rise. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. The steepening yield curve reflects structural issues, such as Japanese life insurance companies meeting their buying requirements and the Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases. Some analysts warn of a significant impact on global markets due to increased borrowing costs and reduced global growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed embassies to halt scheduling appointments for student visas, preparing to expand social media vetting for applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's memo states the pause will last until further guidance is issued, impacting institutions relying on foreign students for funding. The administration aims to focus on social media content deemed supportive of "terrorist activity," amid concerns about left-wing ideologies and antisemitism on campuses. This move follows previous actions, including freezing university funding and revoking student visas, many of which have been challenged in court.</p>

          <p>A former police chief convicted of murder and sexual assault escaped from an Arkansas prison by impersonating a corrections officer. Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," walked out of the North Central Unit after a prison officer opened a secure gate for him. The escape has rattled the community and prompted a search in the rugged Ozark Mountains. Authorities are using canines, drones, and helicopters to locate Hardin, who has a history of violent crimes and knowledge of the local terrain.</p>
