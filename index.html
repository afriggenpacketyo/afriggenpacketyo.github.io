          <p>The United States has urged China to release 30 leaders from one of the country's largest underground Christian networks, Zion Church, who were detained in nationwide raids. The crackdown, described by activists as the most extensive in decades, targets churches that operate outside the state-sanctioned system. Zion Church founder Jin Mingri is among those arrested, prompting condemnation from US officials and concern from human rights groups. The Chinese government stated it was unaware of the case but opposes US interference in its internal affairs regarding religious issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lloyds Banking Group has set aside an additional £800 million to cover compensation claims related to the car finance scandal, bringing its total provision to almost £2 billion. The move follows proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for a redress scheme for millions of drivers who were sold finance deals with hidden commission payments between 2007 and 2024. The FCA estimates that the scandal could cost lenders a total of £8.2 billion, with around 14 million deals potentially eligible for payouts. Lloyds acknowledged the potential impact is at the higher end of its previous expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas have reportedly been released and handed over to the Red Cross as part of a multi-phase operation. The exchange involves Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The development coincides with the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump in Israel, who will later attend a Gaza peace summit in Egypt with over 20 other world leaders. The summit aims to formalize an end to the two-year conflict, with the EU also announcing it will restart its border monitoring mission at the Rafah crossing.</p>

          <p>Coastal communities in western Alaska are experiencing severe flooding and hurricane-force winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, leading to catastrophic damage. Entire houses have been pushed off their foundations in the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, prompting a large-scale search and rescue operation for unaccounted-for residents. The Alaska National Guard has been activated to assist, and Governor Mike Dunleavy has expanded a state disaster declaration. Hundreds of people have taken shelter in local schools as the storm inundates roads and damages infrastructure in the remote region.</p>

          <p>After reaping record profits in 2022, major energy firms like Exxon Mobil, Shell, and BP are now facing a downturn due to weaker crude oil prices.

Analysts expect that share buyback programs will be the first to be reduced to avoid cutting dividends, which could alarm investors.

With the government needing to raise revenue to meet its fiscal rules, the influential think tank warns that some simple tax rises could be economically harmful. The IFS suggests that reforming property taxes, such as updating council tax valuations from 1991, and fixing capital gains tax would be fairer and more growth-friendly. This approach, they argue, would create a better system rather than just implementing unpopular tax increases. (not investment advice)</p>
