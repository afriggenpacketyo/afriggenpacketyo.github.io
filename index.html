          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in targeted shootings. Authorities have arrested 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, who they believe impersonated a police officer to gain access to the lawmakers' homes. The suspect, who served on a state board with Hoffman, had a list of potential targets, including other lawmakers and abortion rights advocates. Governor Tim Walz has called the shootings politically motivated, and investigations are ongoing to determine the full extent of the suspect's motives and connections.</p>

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites. Gambling with overseas-based betting sites is illegal in Japan, prompting the government to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites. The move comes after media revelations that some professional athletes and celebrities have used online casinos, with a police survey estimating that over 3 million people in Japan have gambled online. The government plans to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are expected to meet in Canada on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' summit to discuss ongoing bilateral tariff talks. The leaders are expected to follow up on recent ministerial-level talks aimed at concluding a "mutually beneficial" deal following the imposition of higher import tariffs by the United States. Tokyo has been calling for Washington to shift its focus to boosting investment and jobs, rather than imposing tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani is set to make his Dodgers pitching debut against the San Diego Padres. Ohtani, who signed a 10-year, $700-million contract with the Dodgers, underwent Tommy John surgery in September 2023. After a season focused on hitting, Ohtani has ramped up his throwing program and is ready to pitch again, starting with a limited inning or two. Manager Dave Roberts noted the anticipation surrounding Ohtani's return to the mound.</p>

          <p>Israel and Iran continued exchanging missile attacks for a third day, despite international calls for de-escalation. The exchange of fire comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program between the U.S. and Iran were called off. Iran reported that Israeli strikes targeted its oil refineries and killed a top Revolutionary Guard commander, while Israel claimed Iran has fired over 270 missiles since the conflict began. The escalating conflict has resulted in rising death tolls on both sides and heightened regional tensions.</p>

          <p>China's economic data in May showed mixed signals, with US tariffs continuing to impact manufacturing and exports, while domestic consumption picked up. Retail sales rose by 6.4%, exceeding forecasts, driven by the upcoming online shopping festival and government efforts to boost consumer spending. The trade-in program for appliances and household goods has generated significant sales this year, but some regions have halted their programs due to depleted funds. Falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment despite stronger retail figures.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers secured a series victory over the Giants after a pregame trade involving the Red Sox and Giants disrupted San Francisco's plans.
