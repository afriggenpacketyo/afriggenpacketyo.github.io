          <h2>Controversy Surrounds DOGE Employees' Access to Classified Nuclear Networks</h2>

          <p>Two employees from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have reportedly gained access to classified networks containing sensitive information about America's nuclear weapons, raising security concerns. Despite denials from the Department of Energy, sources claim that Luke Farritor and Adam Ramada have had accounts on these networks for at least two weeks. While their presence alone doesn't grant full access, it allows them to request classified information, potentially escalating DOGE's influence within the agency. This revelation follows previous concerns about DOGE's handling of data at other government agencies, amid growing scrutiny over security protocols. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that he is not currently concerned about American shops running out of items due to President Trump's tariffs. He attributed this to retailers pre-ordering goods and anticipated elasticities in the market. Bessent also suggested that the situation depends on how quickly China wants to de-escalate the trade tensions. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>The UN's top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), has begun hearings for an opinion on Israel's legal duty to allow aid to Palestinians and to cooperate with the UN's Palestinian aid agency, Unrwa. The hearings were opened with a testimony accusing Israel of a "genocidal campaign" against the Palestinians and Israel was seeking "deliberately to deprive the population in Gaza". A ruling is expected to take many months. Optimism Score: 30</p>
