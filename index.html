          <p>Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba have reportedly acquired Nvidia GPUs from ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to bolster their AI development efforts. Tencent purchased around $275 million worth of GPUs, primarily Nvidia's H20 chips, to support its ChatGPT-like application, Yuanbao. Alibaba also obtained GPUs from ByteDance for similar AI-related projects. This comes amid high demand for computing power due to AI adoption and US export restrictions, which have complicated access to advanced semiconductor technologies for Chinese firms.

          <p>Meta's significant spending on AI infrastructure, particularly its Llama models, is coming under investor scrutiny as President Trump's tariff policies raise concerns about potential cost increases.

Investors are eager to see a return on investment from these AI initiatives, especially regarding AI agents for customer interaction within Facebook and WhatsApp. While Meta is unlikely to immediately curb its Llama investments, it may need to re-evaluate if monetization doesn't materialize.</p>

These companies' stock prices have been negatively impacted, with PayPal particularly exposed due to its reliance on consumer-driven transactions and international markets.

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. since the start of President Trump's second term, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary motivator, the White House has promoted these moves as contributing to job creation. Economists caution that factors like labor costs, tax rates, and regulatory environments also significantly influence manufacturing location decisions. Tariffs' potential to foster job growth is limited due to their broad-based nature, rather than targeted support for specific industries.</p>

          <p>The increasing accessibility of private equity to retail investors raises concerns about their preparedness for the complexities and risks involved.

The opaque nature of private equity, with limited disclosure requirements, and the illiquid nature of these assets pose challenges for retail investors. The fear of missing out can lead to poor decision-making and a lack of understanding of higher fees and longer lock-up periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by significant changes, but also a perceived overemphasis on tariffs. While he maintains support from his base, disapproval is growing among others who believe he is not adequately addressing prices. His approval ratings on the economy and inflation have declined, though he retains majority approval for his deportation program. The poll also reveals partisan divisions in economic outlook and views on immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The cost of obtaining a driver's license in Germany has become increasingly unaffordable for young people, sparking calls for reform. The extensive and strictly regulated driving education system can cost between €2,500 and €3,500, making it a luxury for many. Rising failure rates on practical driving tests, stricter testing conditions, and the increasing complexity of traffic situations contribute to the high costs. Proposals to simplify the theory portion of training and incorporate driving simulators are being considered to make driving lessons more accessible.</p>
