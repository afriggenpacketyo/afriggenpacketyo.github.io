          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. defeated Conor Benn after a dramatic 12-round fight at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, marking the culmination of a rivalry fueled by their fathers' historic duels.

Eubank Jr. credited his reconciliation with his father, Chris Eubank Sr., as giving him the edge, while Benn expressed the importance of family, stating that his opponent's reunification with his father was the most important outcome of the match.

          <p>Donald Trump's job approval rating has hit a historic low of 39% within his first 100 days, according to a new poll. Majorities disapprove of many of Trump's policies, and widespread economic discontent prevails, including fears of a recession. Despite these negative views, Trump still beats the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems. This reflects a broader disaffection with both parties.</p>
