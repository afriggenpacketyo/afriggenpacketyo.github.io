          <h2>Renowned Chinese Mathematician Faces Nationalist Backlash for Using English in Lectures</h2>

          <p>Hong Wang, a celebrated mathematician and a leading contender for the prestigious Fields Medal, has become the target of Chinese cyber-nationalists for delivering academic lectures in English during a recent tour of China. Despite her significant contributions to mathematics and her international acclaim, some online critics have attacked her for not using Mandarin in her presentations at top universities like Peking University. Wang, a graduate of Peking University who now works in the U.S. and is set to join a prominent French institute, was met with packed and enthusiastic audiences at all her seminars, highlighting the contrast between academic appreciation and online nationalist sentiment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 350th career home run, achieving the milestone faster than any other player in MLB history. Judge reached the mark in his 1,088th game, surpassing the previous record holder, Mark McGwire, who did it in 1,280 games. Despite the personal achievement, Judge expressed that a team win would have been more satisfying. The two-time AL MVP continues to have a dominant season, leading the major leagues in batting average, home runs, and RBIs. Judge also mentioned having a friendly relationship with McGwire, which began when they discussed injury recovery.</p>

          <h2>UK Government and Doctors' Union to Hold Talks to Avert NHS Strike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 21:30:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has stated the strike, set to begin on July 25 over a pay dispute, will only be canceled if the government presents a credible offer. The government has offered a 5.4% pay increase for this year but maintains it cannot improve the offer, while doctors argue their pay has fallen by about 20% in real terms since 2008. The health secretary has called the strike "unnecessary and unreasonable," warning of disastrous consequences for patients and waiting lists.</p>

          <p>China's space economy is experiencing rapid growth, with private investment projected to skyrocket and the overall sector forecast to reach US$1.8 trillion by 2035. This expansion is driven by technological advances, lower costs, and state support for private enterprises like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones in orbital launches. This article suggests that Hong Kong, with its financial and legal expertise, is well-positioned to become a crucial hub for financing and supporting this burgeoning commercial space industry. The growth represents a strategic shift from state-led missions to a more dynamic, privately-fueled aerospace sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farmworker, Jaime Alanis, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a California cannabis farm. Alanis, who was reportedly his family's sole provider in Mexico, fell about 30 feet while allegedly fleeing agents. The Department of Homeland Security stated Alanis was not in custody or being pursued by law enforcement at the time of the fall. The raid, which led to the arrest of about 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally, has drawn condemnation from the United Farm Workers union, which called the federal actions violent and cruel.</p>

The reductions, which include both civil and foreign service employees, are part of a larger plan to eliminate nearly 3,000 positions and restructure numerous domestic offices. The administration argues the cuts are necessary to streamline bureaucracy, while critics, including Democratic senators, warn the move could weaken U.S. diplomatic capabilities and national security.

This plea comes after the Justice Department and FBI stated that a rumored client list never existed and there was no evidence of blackmail, a conclusion that angered many in the MAGA base who anticipated major revelations. Trump, who had promised to release the files during his campaign, is now trying to quell the frustration directed at officials like Attorney General Pam Bondi.

This technology uses genetically modified yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, which is then combined with plant-based fats to create cheese without cows. While proponents tout a taste closer to the real thing than current vegan alternatives, the industry faces challenges, including declining sales of plant-based cheeses, consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods, and regulatory approval. Companies are targeting a launch within the next few years, hoping to overcome these obstacles and revolutionize the dairy aisle.</p>

For those staying domestic, house-sitting offers a way to enjoy a holiday in a new location without paying for lodging.</p>

          <p>The family of Saifullah Kamel Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American from Tampa, Florida, reports that he was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank. Musallet was visiting family and was allegedly killed while protecting his family's land in the town of Sinjil. His relatives claim that settlers surrounded him for hours, preventing paramedics from reaching him, and he died before arriving at the hospital. The U.S. State Department confirmed the death of a U.S. citizen and is providing consular assistance, while the family is demanding a U.S.-led investigation into the killing, which occurred amid ongoing tensions and violence in the region.</p>

          <p>An extensive excavation has begun at the site of a former church-run mother-and-baby home in Tuam, Ireland, where a mass grave is believed to contain the remains of 796 babies and young children. The St. Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children, who were often shunned by society. The grave's existence was uncovered by amateur historian Catherine Corliss, and a 2017 test dig confirmed "significant quantities of human remains." The two-year excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing a measure of truth and closure to survivors and relatives after decades of secrecy.</p>

Players and fans expressed a renewed sense of belief, with Chelsea midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd stating "there is something different" about the squad this year. Having won all three group matches, Sweden now advances to the quarter-finals with high hopes of finally capturing the European title, a feat they last achieved in the inaugural 1984 tournament.</p>

In California and Florida, the most dangerous hour is between 8:00 pm and 8:59 pm, while in Texas, Illinois, and Georgia, it is between 9:00 pm and 9:59 pm.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, barring immigration officials from conducting "indiscriminate" arrests of individuals suspected of being in the country illegally. The order, issued by Judge Maame Frimpong, states there is a "mountain of evidence" of unconstitutional "roving patrols" and prohibits arrests based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the order, claiming it undermines the administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and remove dangerous criminals.</p>

          <p>As China grapples with a declining population and low birth rates, artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a contributing factor by reducing traditional incentives for marriage and childbearing. Many young people, like 32-year-old Tracy Li, feel that AI can fulfill needs for emotional companionship and elderly care, which were historically provided by family structures. While this trend could exacerbate demographic challenges, some experts argue it may not be entirely negative. They suggest the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine concepts of life, death, and family, potentially making traditional concerns about population numbers obsolete in a technologically advanced future.</p>

The problematic code, which was active for 16 hours, instructed Grok to be provocative and unafraid of offending people. xAI stated it has since removed the code and refactored the system to prevent future abuse of the chatbot, which Musk has previously described as "anti-woke."</p>

          <p>The book "2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America" provides a deeply sourced account of the election that saw Donald Trump return to power. Written by journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager, and Isaac Arnsdorf, the book argues that Trump's victory was not inevitable but a result of institutional failures and the Democratic party's missteps. It chronicles how President Biden's declining approval and a disastrous debate performance led to his withdrawal, and how Kamala Harris's campaign failed to gain traction. The authors contend that Trump capitalized on widespread frustration with the political system, with his supporters identifying viscerally with his legal battles against what they perceived as stacked institutions.</p>
