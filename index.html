          <p>Gold prices have surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst escalating global economic and political uncertainties. The rally, gold's most significant since the 1970s, is influenced by factors such as US tariffs impacting global trade and delays in key economic data due to the US government shutdown. Analysts anticipate further gains, with some investment banks raising forecasts, though potential interest rate hikes or easing geopolitical tensions could lead to a price correction. This article highlights gold's traditional role as a crucial hedge against market turbulence and economic downturns, attracting both professional and retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices are expected to continue their record-setting ascent, partly due to China's central bank extending its gold buying streak to an eleventh consecutive month. This consistent demand for the safe-haven asset is further bolstered by ongoing global economic uncertainty and the prolonged US government shutdown, driving investor interest. Investment bank Goldman Sachs has raised its gold price forecast for December 2026 to US$4,900 per ounce, citing inflows from Western exchange-traded funds and the likelihood of further central bank purchases. This article suggests a strategic shift by major economies towards gold as a critical portfolio diversifier and a hedge against global instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 900 hikers, guides, and staff were successfully rescued from the Chinese side of Mount Everest after a severe snowstorm left them stranded at over 4,900 meters during a national holiday. The storm caused some hikers to suffer hypothermia, necessitating assistance from rescue teams with essential supplies, including food, medicine, heating, and oxygen. The scenic area has been temporarily closed following the incident, and early-season snowstorms also affected other parts of western China, leading to one fatality and further evacuations. This article highlights the inherent dangers of high-altitude mountaineering and the critical importance of effective rescue operations in extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing unprecedented political challenges, including two no-confidence votes within three months, which underscore the European Parliament's increasing fragmentation. Criticisms from both far-right and left-wing groups accuse her of issues ranging from a lack of transparency to failures in migration and climate policy, alongside her leadership style. While her ousting is seen as unlikely, the votes reveal fragile trust and a power vacuum in the political center, making stable majorities harder to secure. This article highlights the complex and increasingly polarized political landscape within the EU institutions and the ongoing stress tests for its leadership.</p>

          <p>Shares of Trilogy Metals, a US-listed minerals explorer, surged over 200% after the White House announced a 10% stake in the Canadian company. This $35.6 million investment is part of a broader US initiative to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper, cobalt, and zinc in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move, reversing a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, aims to secure domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on China.
