          <p>London's Tate Modern gallery has announced it will extend its opening times to 9:00 PM on Fridays and Saturdays starting this autumn. The decision aims to make the gallery more accessible, particularly to younger visitors and those who work during standard hours. This move builds on the success of the Tate Modern Lates program, a series of popular evening events that have attracted over 750,000 people since 2016. The gallery's director and London's mayor both praised the change, highlighting its potential to enhance the city's cultural nightlife.</p>

          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships in Singapore are set to feature a highly anticipated duel between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. Their clash in the 800m freestyle is being framed as a potential generational shift in the sport, as McIntosh is the only swimmer to have beaten the dominant Ledecky in that event in 15 years. McIntosh arrives in historic form, having broken multiple world records, and is attempting to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished. The event will also feature other top swimmers like Léon Marchand and David Popovici.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international cooperation to establish a global consensus on the governance of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li criticized monopolistic control over AI technologies and announced a Chinese-led initiative to promote open-access cooperation. The call comes amidst an intensifying tech rivalry with the United States, which has imposed restrictions on high-end chip exports to China, prompting Chinese firms to develop their own advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved its first win under head coach Sean Lynn by defeating Australia in a pre-World Cup match in Brisbane. After a winless Six Nations campaign, the victory provides a significant morale boost for the team. The game was temporarily halted due to a thunderstorm, after which Wales scored two tries to take the lead. Despite a late push from the Australian Wallaroos, the Welsh defense held strong to secure a 14-12 victory, an encouraging performance against a higher-ranked opponent.</p>

The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature back to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than one-fifth of its total workforce, have applied to leave the agency through a government-wide deferred resignation program. This significant reduction in personnel comes as the agency faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and a recent leadership crisis. The departures would shrink NASA's civil servant workforce from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The agency stated that safety remains a top priority as it works to become a more streamlined and efficient organization for future exploration missions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without star Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production. Key performances came from outfielder Teoscar Hernández, who had a run-scoring walk and a two-run homer, and rookie Andy Pages, who contributed with a double and a sacrifice fly. The win was supported by a solid start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a scoreless effort from the bullpen, providing a positive start to their road trip.</p>

          <h2>House Democrats Formally Request Epstein 'Birthday Book' Reportedly Containing Trump Message</h2>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen have officially requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for the late sex offender. The request follows reports that the book contains messages from numerous powerful individuals, including a crude poem and doodle from Donald Trump, a claim Trump is suing over. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation. This move escalates the political pressure surrounding the Epstein case and Trump's past associations.</p>
