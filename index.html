          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Monday morning. The victims, mostly young adults and teenagers, were among a crowd of about 40 people when gunfire erupted. Police recovered nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence, suggesting an automatic weapon was used, and have one person in custody, though their role is unclear. The incident was part of a violent holiday weekend in the city, which has nonetheless seen a year-over-year decrease in homicides and shootings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced steep new tariffs on imports from seven countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, set to take effect on August 1. The tariffs range from 25% to 40% and are part of the president's "reciprocal" trade policy aimed at correcting U.S. trade deficits. The letters sent to the nations warn against retaliatory duties and suggest the rates could be adjusted based on future relationships. The announcement caused U.S. financial markets to fall, with critics questioning the economic strategy of using trade deficits as a primary measure of fairness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped by 6.8% on Monday following CEO Elon Musk's weekend announcement that he has formed a new political entity, the "America Party." The move, which follows a public falling out with President Trump, has renewed investor concerns about Musk's deep involvement in politics and its potential negative impact on the Tesla brand. Analysts suggest that shareholders would prefer Musk to focus on the company during a challenging period of declining sales, rather than engaging in political battles. This development marks another unpredictable turn in Musk's public persona. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced its worst first-half performance since 1973, and analysts predict further headwinds due to several persistent factors. The currency's 10.7% decline is attributed to policy volatility, growing national debt, and the possibility of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters, its continued slide fuels concerns about the end of its global dominance, as central banks increasingly turn to alternatives like gold. Some strategists believe the decline is overdone, but significant fundamental concerns about the U.S. economy remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of heavily armed federal immigration agents, including some on horseback and in armored vehicles, conducted a large-scale enforcement operation in MacArthur Park, a central hub for Los Angeles's immigrant community. The show of force, part of the Trump administration's ramped-up deportation efforts, was met by protesters and activists who mobilized to the area. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also arrived at the scene, demanding the agents leave immediately. The raid caused chaos and fear in the neighborhood, with rights groups decrying the action as a "perverse publicity stunt."</p>

          <p>A new round of indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar, aimed at securing a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has ended without any significant progress, according to Palestinian sources. The talks, mediated by Qatari and Egyptian officials, reportedly stalled because the Israeli delegation was not sufficiently authorized to reach a final agreement. The failure to advance a deal prolongs the ongoing conflict and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. The White House stated that ending the war and returning all hostages remains a top priority for the U.S. administration.</p>

          <h2>Texas Flooding Fueled by Up to 20 Inches of Rain in Some Areas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas were caused by an extreme rainfall event over the holiday weekend, with some areas receiving more than 20 inches of rain. Preliminary data from the National Weather Service shows that the massive amount of precipitation fell in a short period, overwhelming the Guadalupe River and its tributaries. The Texas Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding, but the sheer volume of water, fueled by remnant tropical moisture, caused the river to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes, leading to the deadly and destructive deluge.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of pterosaur from a 209-million-year-old jawbone fossil discovered in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The creature, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, is now the earliest known flying reptile found in North America. Researchers say the seagull-sized reptile likely fed on hard-shelled, primitive fish in an ancient river system. The discovery is significant because Triassic pterosaur fossils are extremely rare due to their small, hollow bones, and this find helps fill a critical gap in the evolutionary record before a mass extinction event.</p>

          <p>California is on track to meet its "30x30" goal of conserving 30% of its lands and coastal waters by 2030, according to a new state report. The state has now conserved 26.1% of its lands, largely thanks to the recent designation of two new national monuments by the Biden administration. However, state officials worry this progress could be reversed, as the Trump administration has signaled it may seek to abolish these monuments and has terminated the national version of the conservation initiative. The report highlights the tension between state-level environmental efforts and shifting federal policies.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in 33 years, with nearly 1,300 confirmed cases reported across 38 states so far in 2025. According to the CDC, the vast majority of cases (92%) are among individuals who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. The highly contagious disease, once declared eliminated in the U.S. around 2000, has seen a resurgence fueled by growing anti-vaccine sentiment. Public health officials warn that the country is at risk of losing its measles elimination status if the current rate of spread continues.</p>

The IDF stated the ship was being used by the Houthis as a floating observation platform with a radar system to track other vessels. The attack was part of a broader wave of strikes on Houthi-controlled ports in response to the group's repeated missile attacks on Israel and disruptions to global shipping. The incident marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-aligned Houthi group.</p>
