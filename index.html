        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his office has not been consulted and suggested the move has ulterior motives beyond crime reduction, possibly related to influencing future elections. The White House responded by criticizing the city's crime rate, escalating the political conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement. This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>

This philosophy prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, leveraging the growing influence of middle-power nations to navigate a world often paralyzed by the competing agendas of superpowers. The article posits that Indonesia's unique position could provide a practical road map for a more functional global order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to reports of a potential federal troop deployment, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks, require clear identification, and prevent the Chicago Police Department from being deputized for federal actions. Johnson emphasized that the city will use all available legal tools to oppose what he described as militarized activity by the federal government. The move formalizes the city's opposition and sets the stage for a potential legal battle with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The initial week of the US Open has been marked by notable displays of anger and frustration from several high-profile tennis players, including Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Jelena Ostapenko. These outbursts are seen as a reflection of the high-stress environment of the year's final Grand Slam, compounded by player fatigue at the end of a long season. Fellow players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff suggest that the intense and vocal New York crowds also contribute to the heightened emotions on the court. The article posits that while drama is common on the tour, the US Open stage amplifies these incidents.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old man has been formally charged with four counts of murder for a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, that left a bartender and three patrons dead. The suspect, Michael Paul Brown, lived next door to the establishment and was apprehended after a week-long manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officers. Authorities have not yet disclosed a motive, though his niece indicated he had a history of mental illness.

          <p>The Irish government has formally expressed its concern to German authorities after a video showed Berlin police striking a 25-year-old Irish woman during a protest. The demonstration was held against the killing of journalists in Gaza. The woman, Kitty O'Brien, was reportedly hospitalized with a broken arm following the incident. Berlin police stated that officers were compelled to use force after protesters ignored orders to disperse and that O'Brien had resisted and insulted officers. The incident has sparked protests at the German Embassy in Dublin and drawn criticism from Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin.</p>

          <p>Approximately 11,000 people participated in a protest against the war in Gaza in Frankfurt, Germany, after courts overturned the city's attempt to ban the demonstration. The city had cited concerns about the event being a "potentially anti-Semitic gathering," but courts ruled the ban was unjustified without an immediate danger to public safety. The march, held under the banner "United4Gaza – Stop the Genocide Now!," proceeded largely without major incidents, though one speaker was detained for comments allegedly trivializing the Holocaust.

The hotel owner argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, leads to regular complaints from guests who are unaccustomed to the noise. However, councillors maintained that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents. The decision means the historic clock, recently restored for £55,000, will continue to sound 24 hours a day, preserving a local tradition over commercial concerns.</p>

          <p>Decades after the fact, new evidence suggests that famed Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," may have murdered his own wife, Pauline, in 1967. It was long believed she was killed in an ambush meant for him, but a renewed investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation found major inconsistencies in his story. Forensic analysis, including a recent autopsy, indicates the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound Pusser sustained was likely self-inflicted. Officials now believe they have enough evidence to have secured an indictment for murder had Pusser, who died in 1974, still been alive.</p>

Musically, the album blends '70s-era pop influences with modern dance and country touches, created with her consistent team of collaborators led by Jack Antonoff. While not every track is as strong as her previous work, songs like "Goodbye" and "House Tour" showcase her continued artistic growth and clever songwriting.</p>

Similarly, Fulham's manager Marco Silva was incensed after a goal was disallowed in their match against Chelsea following a VAR review.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on goods from most countries. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration cited, does not grant the president the power to implement such broad levies, stating that authority rests with Congress. The decision puts tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. imports on shaky legal ground, though the duties will remain in effect temporarily to allow for a potential appeal to the Supreme Court. However, sector-specific tariffs on items like steel and aluminum are not affected by this ruling.</p>

For the youngest children (under 3), experts recommend a screen-free environment to encourage exploration and self-regulation of attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised, with an emphasis on content quality and parental interaction over strict time limits. The primary concern is that excessive screen time displaces crucial activities like physical play, social interaction, and language development, which are essential for building motor skills and emotional intelligence.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook could seriously undermine the central bank's political independence. She argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility, leading to negative long-term economic consequences such as higher inflation, a weaker currency, and reduced foreign investment. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, Patterson believes the damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy. She suggests this could lead to a steeper yield curve, a weaker dollar, and higher gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

This action follows a federal judge blocking the administration from firing VOA's director and threatening contempt for non-compliance with orders to restore the network's operations. Critics view the layoffs as an attack on press freedom and America's soft power.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who has been instrumental in the team's recent victories since joining on loan from Manchester City. Grealish provided two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolverhampton, repeating his performance from the previous week and earning man-of-the-match honors. Moyes noted that Grealish, who struggled for playing time at his parent club, is thriving with more attention and game time, bringing a creative edge to the team. The player's resurgence at Everton has reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services. In an op-ed, Sanders accused Kennedy of endangering public health through his long-standing anti-vaccine advocacy and promotion of conspiracy theories. The call comes amid chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where the director was recently fired and several top officials resigned in protest of Kennedy's policies. Sanders stated that Kennedy is using his authority to wage a "war on science," which will make it harder for Americans to access lifesaving immunizations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils in the UK intend to continue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against such a measure. The court overturned an injunction obtained by Epping Forest District Council, which was seen as a test case. However, some councils, including those controlled by the Reform UK party, state they will press on with their own legal challenges, primarily citing planning law breaches and public safety concerns. The situation highlights the ongoing political and legal tensions surrounding the government's policy of using hotels for asylum accommodation amid rising protests.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Powys, took matters into their own hands to save thousands of fish that were stranded in a shrinking puddle after a local brook dried up due to prolonged drought. A local man, Dave Lister, discovered the fish "gasping for air" and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency, organized a group of friends to move the fish to a nearby river. Natural Resources Wales later stated that moving fish during such extreme conditions can cause more harm than good. However, the residents felt their actions were necessary to prevent the fish from perishing in the rapidly evaporating water.</p>
