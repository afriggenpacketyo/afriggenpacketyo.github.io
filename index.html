            <h2>Trump Administration Freezes Harvard Funding Over DEI Concerns</h2>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus and Harvard's rejection of demands to eliminate DEI programs and screen international students for ideological concerns. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the university's independence and constitutional rights, arguing that the demands represent governmental regulation of academic freedom. Federal agencies responded that the funding freeze was due to Harvard's failure to uphold civil rights laws and address harassment of Jewish students. The administration's actions follow similar measures against other universities accused of failing to combat antisemitism and left-wing bias.</p>

            <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported record-low illegal border crossings in March, attributing the decline to increased patrols and support from the Department of Defense. Apprehensions at the southern border decreased by 95% compared to March 2024 under the Biden administration, while illicit drug seizures, including fentanyl, have increased. CBP Acting Commissioner Pete Flores credited the agency's dedicated agents for the achievement, emphasizing the Trump administration's message that illegal border crossings will result in deportation. The report highlights a shift in border security efforts and their impact on immigration patterns.</p>

            <p>A BBC study reveals that the number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidized theaters has decreased by almost a third in the past decade. Funding cuts, rising costs, and changing audience tastes are cited as contributing factors, leading to fewer opportunities for young talent. Many theaters are now co-producing shows to spread costs, while some prioritize larger-scale productions over smaller ones. Concerns are growing about the impact on the workforce, including low pay and job insecurity, with calls for government action to support the arts.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of supply chains to the U.S. Most companies surveyed believe that bringing back supply chains would significantly increase costs, leading them to seek lower-tariffed countries instead. Automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., and concerns about layoffs are prevalent. The survey also reveals that a majority of respondents feel the Trump administration is bullying corporate America, with order cancellations and anticipated consumer spending pullbacks as immediate reactions to the tariffs.

The conflict has created a significant humanitarian crisis, forcing millions to flee their homes and facing famine-like conditions.

Only residual administrative content was found, raising concerns about potential auto-deletion of messages despite federal preservation requirements. Officials were able to preserve messages from the devices of other officials, including the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is initiating investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, potentially leading to tariffs on these sectors based on national security grounds. Public comment is being solicited, and the inquiries must be completed within 270 days. These investigations follow a pattern of similar actions that have led to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and the auto industry. The U.S. relies heavily on imported chips and pharmaceuticals, and tariffs could impact supply chains, increase costs, and potentially lead to shortages. (not investment advice)</p>

The materials, purchased by the government, are expected to keep the furnaces running for the coming weeks while officials work to establish a steady supply chain.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration asserts it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, despite a court order and Supreme Court ruling. This claim was made shortly after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele stated he would not voluntarily return Abrego Garcia. The administration maintains that it can only facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if El Salvador chooses to send him back. Critics argue the administration is misrepresenting court decisions to avoid taking actions it dislikes.</p>

            <p>The "Silicon Six" tech firms, including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft, are accused of avoiding almost $278 billion in US corporate income taxes over the past decade. The Fair Tax Foundation (FTF) reports that these companies paid an average of 18.8% in combined taxes, compared to the average US rate of 29.7%. The FTF claims that tax avoidance is hardwired into their business models, and that the companies inflate their tax payments by including contingencies for taxes they do not expect to pay.</p>

The increase in 5% and 10% deposit deals provides more options for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates remain higher than in previous years. Despite the increased choice, borrowers still face relatively high mortgage rates, particularly those with smaller deposits. Uncertainty over interest rates and stamp duty changes continues to influence the housing market.</p>

The arrest comes amid an immigration crackdown by the Trump administration and has drawn criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>

            <p>Federal health officials are exploring ways to reduce organ discards and improve the organ placement process, aiming to increase the number of successful transplants. One strategy involves transplanting riskier kidneys that other centers may turn down, after engaging patients in the decision-making process. Patients waiting for a kidney transplant face increased risks of complications while on dialysis. Reducing organ discards requires a shared commitment between transplant hospitals and organ procurement organizations to find homes for hard-to-place kidneys.</p>
