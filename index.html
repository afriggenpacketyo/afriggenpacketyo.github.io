          <p>Prominent Kenyan human rights activist and anti-corruption campaigner Boniface Mwangi has been charged with possession of ammunition amid an investigation into "facilitating terrorist activities." The charges are linked to his alleged role in organizing recent anti-government protests that turned violent, resulting in numerous fatalities. Mwangi's arrest has drawn significant attention, with his supporters and legal team asserting his innocence and claiming the items police found were planted. The case unfolds against a backdrop of renewed unrest in Kenya over police brutality and the high cost of living.</p>

          <p>British television personality Ulrika Jonsson, 57, has pushed back against social media criticism regarding her appearance after a recent podcast interview. Commenters focused on her looking old and tanned, but Jonsson urged them to listen to her words rather than judging her face. She explained that she avoids makeup due to a lifelong struggle with eczema and embraces her sun-worshipping habits. The interview itself focused on her battle with alcohol addiction and her newfound positive outlook on life after more than a year of sobriety, a journey she described as a miraculous change in mindset.</p>

          <h2>House Republicans Criticize Democrats' Newfound Push for Epstein File Transparency from Trump Administration</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of Republican-led calls for transparency regarding Jeffrey Epstein, the political dynamic has shifted, with Democrats now demanding the Trump administration release all related files. This follows a DOJ memo stating Epstein died by suicide and that no "client list" exists, a conclusion that has fractured some parts of the Republican party who still demand more information. House Republicans are criticizing the Democrats' move as a political maneuver, questioning their previous silence on the issue. The situation highlights the deep political polarization surrounding the case and the ongoing battle for government transparency.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is legally challenging the Trump administration in federal court, arguing that the government's decision to cut $2.6 billion in federal funding was an illegal act of retaliation. The university contends the cuts were a response to its refusal to comply with demands from a federal antisemitism task force regarding campus policies, academics, and admissions. The administration denies the move was retaliatory, stating the grants were already under review and that it has the discretion to cancel funding that no longer aligns with government policy. A ruling in Harvard's favor could restore crucial funding for hundreds of scientific and medical research projects.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acting ICE director Todd Lyons outlined the agency's role in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy, emphasizing a primary focus on public safety threats. Lyons addressed the goal of one million annual deportations, made more feasible by a recent $75 billion funding increase for detention and removal operations. He also discussed the significant rise in attacks on ICE agents, which he attributes to heightened political rhetoric. Lyons confirmed that while prioritizing violent offenders, the agency will now also arrest any individual encountered who is in the country illegally, marking a shift from previous policies.</p>

This strategy is seen as a response to a demand from Donald Trump to bolster the Republican majority in Congress.

According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), four in ten people are not saving enough, with nearly half of working-age adults having no private pension savings at all. The revived commission will investigate why certain groups, including the self-employed and low earners, are falling behind and aim to build a national consensus on boosting retirement savings. The move comes as the government also commissions new reviews on the state pension age amid concerns over the rising cost of the triple lock.</p>

          <p>Analysts from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are urging Beijing to address the economic issue of 'neijuan,' or involution, which describes a cycle of excessive, inefficient competition within a limited market. They argue that the solution lies in expanding domestic demand to create a larger market, thereby providing more room for growth rather than fostering a zero-sum environment. The CICC also emphasized the need for companies to focus on research and development to offer differentiated products. This approach would help shift the economy from a state of self-defeating competition to a more positive, demand-driven cycle of innovation and growth.</p>

Despite these headwinds, SLB's revenue for the second quarter surpassed expectations, buoyed by strong offshore activity and drilling demand in the Middle East.

          <p>This analysis argues that Chief Justice John Roberts has been instrumental in expanding the power of the American presidency, creating a legal framework that supports Donald Trump's unprecedented use of executive authority. Through key opinions he authored, Roberts has upheld the "Muslim ban," limited congressional subpoena power over the executive, and developed a new theory of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. The article contends that Roberts has promoted a "unitary-executive theory," casting the president as the head of a one-person branch of government with nearly unchecked power, a view that distorts constitutional text and history to legitimize an increasingly authoritarian presidency.</p>

This action is part of a broader pattern of withholding climate data, including defunding research programs, failing to submit a UN emissions report, and ceasing to track billion-dollar weather disasters. Experts describe this as a shift from climate denial to "denial by erasure," a strategy to remove the scientific basis for climate regulations.

          <p>Following deadly flash floods that killed over 130 people in central Texas earlier this month, Governor Greg Abbott has called a special session of the state legislature. The session will focus on improving the state's emergency procedures and early warning systems to better prepare for future natural disasters. Discussions are expected to cover flood warning systems, emergency communications, relief funding, and overall disaster recovery plans. The move comes as a direct response to the historic flooding that devastated communities over the July Fourth weekend, aiming to ensure Texas is better equipped to handle such events.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump Administration Favors Tariffs Over Sanctions as Primary Foreign Policy Tool</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:36:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly relied on tariffs as its preferred tool for economic leverage, a departure from the traditional use of sanctions by previous governments. This strategy aligns with the "America First" agenda, aiming to protect domestic industries and address trade deficits, particularly with China. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be deployed unilaterally by the president without congressional approval and generate revenue for the US Treasury. However, this approach has created significant uncertainty in global markets and has been used to pressure countries on non-trade issues, blurring the lines between economic policy and punitive foreign policy measures.</p>

          <p>China is on pace to achieve its ambitious goal of having 50,000 kilometers (about 31,000 miles) of operational high-speed rail by the end of the year, according to its Minister of Transport. The country has already added 10,000km of track since 2021, bringing the current total to 48,000km, which accounts for over 70% of the world's total. This extensive network now covers 97% of Chinese cities with populations exceeding 500,000. The announcement comes as national railway passenger trips hit a record 2.24 billion in the first half of 2025, reflecting rising travel demand and improved network capacity.</p>

          <p>Steve Tandy has been named the new head coach of the Wales men's national rugby team, signing a contract that will see him lead the side until at least the 2027 World Cup. The 45-year-old Welshman leaves his role as Scotland's defence coach after the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) agreed to a release deal. Tandy, the first homegrown permanent head coach since 2007, faces the challenge of rebuilding a team that recently hit a record low of 14th in world rankings. His appointment is seen as a long-term, keystone move in the WRU's strategy for achieving sustainable success.</p>

          <p>A group of armed men stormed a pool hall in the coastal tourist city of General Villamil Playas, Ecuador, and opened fire, killing at least nine people. Authorities are investigating the massacre, which occurred in a working-class neighborhood, and are reviewing security footage to identify the suspects armed with automatic rifles. The attack is part of a historic wave of violence sweeping Ecuador as transnational drug trafficking organizations expand their influence.

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has stated the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff for identifying and charging for passengers' oversized luggage. Currently, staff receive about €1.50 per bag, and O'Leary hopes that increasing the incentive will help eliminate delays caused by non-compliant baggage. The budget airline, which recently reported a doubling of its quarterly profits, is aggressive about enforcing its baggage rules, which it says over 99.9% of passengers follow. The discussion comes as the European Parliament pushes for standardized free carry-on luggage allowances, a proposal O'Leary predicts will not become law due to space constraints on aircraft.</p>

          <p>China's Central Military Commission has issued new political regulations for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) aimed at strengthening loyalty to the Communist Party and combating corruption. The guidelines, which were not made public, reportedly draw "clear political red lines" and require military officials to act with integrity, especially in personnel matters. This move follows a significant anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping that has led to investigations into more than a dozen PLA generals and defense industry executives.

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of car brands like Vauxhall, Jeep, and Fiat, has announced that US tariffs have cost it €300 million. The financial impact stems from the 25% tariff on imported cars implemented by the Trump administration, which has disrupted trade and led to lost production for the company. Stellantis reported that its shipments to North America were down 25% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, contributing to a projected net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of the year. The situation highlights the significant repercussions of the tariff policy on global car manufacturers and their supply chains.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review of England and Wales' water sector has recommended a major overhaul, including the dissolution of the economic regulator, Ofwat. The report, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, blames government, companies, and regulators for the sector's poor state, particularly concerning sewage spills and rising bills. Key recommendations include creating a single water regulator for each nation, reforming company self-monitoring to rebuild public trust, and giving the regulator more control over company ownership and executive accountability. While ruling out nationalization, the review suggests bills may need to rise to fund necessary infrastructure investment after a long period of underinvestment.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz is reportedly exploring a major strategic shift by potentially spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business, including legacy Kraft brands like Velveeta cheese. This move is seen as a last-ditch effort to undo the largely unsuccessful 2015 mega-merger, which has seen the company's stock value plummet as consumers move away from processed, brand-name foods. The plan would separate slower-growing grocery products from more promising brands like Heinz ketchup. Analysts note the risky strategy's success would likely depend on finding eventual buyers for the two newly independent entities in a challenging market.</p>
