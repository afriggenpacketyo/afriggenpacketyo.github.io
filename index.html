          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting announced it will return "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to its ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemption that began after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about a conservative activist's death. The late-night show was suspended by Disney's ABC for six days, but Sinclair and other station owners had continued to withhold it. In its statement, Sinclair emphasized its responsibility to provide programming that serves community interests while honoring network obligations. Another major affiliate owner, Nexstar, has not yet indicated when it will resume airing the program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid declining interest rates following a recent Federal Reserve cut, savers have fewer high-yield opportunities, but opening a Certificate of Deposit (CD) soon may still be advantageous. Key reasons include locking in current rates, which are still around 4.50%, before they potentially drop further and allowing interest to compound immediately. With a high probability of another Fed rate cut at the end of October, banks may preemptively lower their CD rates. Therefore, proactive savers might benefit from securing a fixed rate now to ensure predictable returns on their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Howard Rubin, a 70-year-old former Wall Street bond trader, has been arrested on charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts. The indictment alleges that from 2009 to 2019, Rubin and his former assistant operated a network, spending over $1 million to bring women to a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse. Prosecutors claim Rubin engaged in non-consensual and brutalizing acts that sometimes required his victims to seek medical attention. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where a jury found Rubin liable for sex trafficking six women.</p>

          <p>During a Thursday night game against the Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Seahawks receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba's frustrated exclamation was accidentally broadcast over the referee's open microphone. After a holding penalty nullified a teammate's touchdown, Smith-Njigba yelled an expletive which was clearly audible as head referee Alex Kemp was announcing the penalty. Kemp paused and glared at the player but did not issue a further penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, a decision praised by the broadcast commentators. Despite the penalty, the Seahawks ultimately won the game 23-20.</p>

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, who killed four people and himself in a July mass shooting, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asking for his brain to be studied. The shooting occurred in an office building housing NFL offices, which investigators believe was his target. While CTE is linked to repeated head trauma and can cause behavioral changes, experts caution that the diagnosis does not fully explain such a violent act.</p>

          <p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has acknowledged it improperly released a mostly unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to a political opponent. The file, containing her Social Security number and other sensitive personal data, was obtained by an ally of her opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The breach occurred as Republicans were investigating Sherrill's role in a 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal, though she was not accused of cheating. NARA stated a technician failed to follow procedures and has since apologized to the congresswoman.</p>

          <p>The recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstruction is the culmination of a nearly decade-long, contentious relationship with President Donald Trump. Their interactions evolved from Trump's initial praise for Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016 to public animosity after Comey confirmed the Russia probe. Trump fired Comey in 2017, leading to accusations of obstruction and a war of words that has persisted through memoirs, congressional testimony, and social media. The new charges stem from Comey's 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the UK's Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who had the whip withdrawn after voting against the government's two-child benefit cap, defying the party line shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their reinstatement comes as the Labour government signals a potential softening of its stance on the controversial policy, with key ministers suggesting its removal is "on the table." The move is seen as a step toward party unity ahead of the annual conference.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise, understanding the timeline for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial damage. A payment is technically late the day after its due date, though most issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major consequence occurs after 30 days, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. At 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts can begin, potentially leading to account closure.</p>

          <p>This article posits that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a common but flawed tactic used to defend attacks on free speech from both the political right and left. It argues that this approach deflects from a principled debate about liberal norms by focusing on the perceived inconsistencies of opponents rather than the merit of the ideas themselves. The author contends that cancel culture has been a phenomenon within both progressive and conservative circles, often targeting internal dissenters. Ultimately, the piece suggests that focusing on hypocrisy avoids the difficult work of defending the core values of open debate.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the potential monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners looking to borrow a large sum. For a $150,000 loan, current average rates would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,847 for a 10-year term or $1,452 for a 15-year term. These payments are modestly lower than they were earlier in the year, potentially saving borrowers around $1,900 over a decade.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine from multiple drug-smuggling vessels in the Pacific Ocean during August and September. The crew of the Cutter Midgett intercepted four boats off the coasts of Mexico and Central America, seizing over 21,000 pounds of the narcotic. In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized 8,700 pounds of cocaine north of Panama. The agency released an image of one of the alleged drug boats on fire, explaining that such vessels are sunk after narcotics are removed to prevent them from becoming maritime hazards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "rule of thirds" is an emerging retirement strategy designed to provide both security and flexibility for retirees concerned about outliving their savings. The approach involves converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth or used for discretionary spending and unexpected costs. This method aims to create a stable financial foundation, blending a pension-like income stream with accessible funds to navigate market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The author, a long-time Pentagon correspondent, states the new rules could penalize reporters for publishing unapproved, even if unclassified, information, effectively chilling news-gathering. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the changes as common sense security measures. However, the author contends that limiting press access weakens accountability, makes the military appear less transparent, and ultimately harms the American public's right to know.</p>
