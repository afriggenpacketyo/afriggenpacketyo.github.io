        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, where Trump is surrounded by loyalists who rarely challenge his decisions. Unlike his first term, where advisors sometimes curbed his impulses, Trump's second term is characterized by yes-men and accelerationists, removing the guardrails that previously tempered his actions. This choice, Klein asserts, made it clear that Trump's second term would offer no concessions and contain no skeptics, leading to a presidency defined by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is facing a challenging situation as it considers whether to hold interest rates steady amidst conflicting economic signals. While officials are inclined to maintain current rates due to inflation concerns, President Trump and others are urging a rate cut to stimulate the economy. The Fed's decision is further complicated by uncertainty surrounding trade policies and potential impacts on inflation. Economists expect Fed Chair Jerome Powell to prioritize price stability and resist market pressure for a near-term rate cut.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, stated that changing leadership alone would not solve the party's deep-seated issues after significant losses in English local elections. She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions and emphasized a slow, steady plan to regain government by the end of the decade. Badenoch acknowledged the protest vote evident in the elections and stressed the importance of credible policies over empty promises. She also addressed the rise of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, but maintained her commitment to preventing him from becoming prime minister.</p>

          <p>NYU professor Scott Galloway suggests that a significant portion of wealthy senior citizens should not receive Social Security benefits, arguing that they are the wealthiest generation in history and that transferring wealth from younger generations is unfair. Galloway proposes eliminating benefits for the top 10% to 30% of retirees to address wealth imbalance and reduce the burden on young workers. He contends that Social Security is not necessarily an entitlement and that many recipients take out more than they contribute.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's policies are creating significant uncertainty and instability in the US economy, according to Heather Stewart. The economy is in a “transition period” marked by policy ambiguity, trade wars, and budget cuts, leading to anxiety among businesses and consumers. While hard data is holding up, forward-looking surveys reveal concerns about the future. Trump's actions, including immigration policies and tariffs, are disrupting supply chains, raising prices, and creating shortages, potentially leading to economic distress.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party made significant gains in recent local elections in England, challenging the dominance of the Labour and Conservative parties. The results reflect public disenchantment with the two main parties and a rise in support for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens. Experts suggest this shift could signal a long-term fragmentation of British politics, making it harder for either Labour or the Conservatives to maintain their traditional hold on power. The surge in support for Reform UK has led to concerns about the future of the Conservative Party and the potential for increased political instability.</p>
