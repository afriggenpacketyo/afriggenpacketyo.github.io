          <p>The Trump administration is deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles following large-scale protests sparked by ICE operations, leading to clashes between protesters and authorities. Governor Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory, asserting that local authorities can manage the situation, while Mayor Bass indicated cooperation with federal officials to find a resolution. The deployment raises questions about federal authority over the National Guard and the use of Title 10, a waiver of the Posse Comitatus Act that restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Tensions remain high as protests continue, with some resulting in arrests and property damage.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on Sunday and Monday to decide whether to halve the time required for immigrants to apply for citizenship, reducing the wait from 10 years to five, aligning the country with most of Europe. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is boycotting the vote, calling the existing citizenship law "excellent" and "very open", while other parties urge Italians to go to the beach instead. The referendum, initiated by a citizens' initiative, aims to integrate long-term foreign residents already working in Italy and their children, potentially granting citizenship to up to 1.4 million people. Supporters argue the reform would change perceptions of immigrants and address practical issues like job opportunities and access to services.</p>

The author criticizes the Labour government's decision to spend billions on new nuclear warheads, asserting that it perpetuates illusions about Britain's global power status. Tisdall suggests that the UK should focus on gradual disarmament rather than rearmament, as nuclear weapons do not make the country safer and their use would be immoral and catastrophic.

          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that President Trump's self-dealing and personal enrichment while in office pose a fundamental danger to the U.S. political system. The author, Ben Rhodes, contends that Trump's actions are transforming the country into one where power is personalized and profited from, similar to what Vladimir Putin has done in Russia. Rhodes warns that this fusion of political and personal interests erodes ethical frameworks and weakens checks and balances, ultimately undermining the interests of the people. </p>

          <p>President Trump has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, bypassing consultation with California's Governor Newsom, who accused the White House of "sowing chaos". Defense Secretary Hegseth threatened to mobilize active-duty Marines, leading Newsom to condemn the move as deranged. Trump justified the deployment by stating that he would step in if the Mayor and Governor couldn't do their jobs, while the LAPD reported that the demonstrations were now peaceful. The move reflects a widening gulf between California's political leaders and the federal government, raising concerns about the use of federal force in domestic affairs.</p>

Bowen explores the issue through the lens of international laws designed to protect civilians during warfare. He notes growing international concern over Israel's conduct and potential complicity in war crimes, with some lawyers alleging evidence of genocide. The article discusses the high Palestinian casualty figures, restrictions on aid, and the use of hunger as a weapon of war, while examining arguments about proportionality and the intent to destroy a group, which would constitute genocide.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have utilized the rare mineral tellurium to develop an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them "super vision," the ability to see infrared light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina. This breakthrough offers significant promise for treating human blindness, with scientists optimistic about its potential to improve vision.

The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than subsidizing mothers alone. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The study also notes that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China, conflicting with economic changes.</p>
