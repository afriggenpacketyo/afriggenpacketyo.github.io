          <p>A significant backlog is preventing tens of thousands of public service workers from accessing student loan forgiveness. The article highlights the case of a librarian, just five payments shy of eligibility, who has been waiting eight months for her application to the PSLF Buyback program to be processed. As of June, nearly 65,500 buyback requests are pending, a situation critics attribute to administrative slowdowns and staffing reductions at the Department of Education. This delay leaves many borrowers in financial uncertainty, unable to plan for their future while their debt remains unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a figure who has drawn criticism from President Trump for his role in legal cases involving former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. The sanctions block any U.S. property of de Moraes, whom the Treasury accuses of leading an oppressive campaign of censorship and politicized prosecutions. This action follows a lawsuit by Trump's social media company against the judge and comes just before the planned imposition of new tariffs on Brazilian imports. The move underscores escalating tensions over legal and political matters in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting a sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, Starbucks is showing early signs of a recovery, according to some Wall Street analysts. Executives noted that customer traffic improved each month during the quarter, with notable growth among non-loyalty program members for the first time in years. CEO Brian Niccol stated the company's turnaround is ahead of schedule, pointing to new labor programs and upcoming menu innovations like protein cold foam.

          <p>Tsunami warnings across Hawaii and the west coast of North America have been downgraded or canceled after a massive earthquake off Russia's coast. While Hawaii recorded waves nearly six feet high and prompted evacuations, authorities reported no major damage or "wave of consequence." Smaller waves reached the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, where advisories remained in place urging people to stay away from the water due to strong currents. The event caused widespread alarm, but the threat of catastrophic flooding in the Americas appears to have passed, bringing relief to coastal communities.</p>

The hearing highlighted that the flight routes approved by the FAA allowed for dangerously small separation distances between helicopters and landing planes.

          <p>This article explores whether seniors who receive Social Security should also purchase annuities to ensure financial security in retirement. While Social Security provides a steady income, it often isn't enough to cover all living expenses, prompting retirees to seek supplemental sources. Annuities can offer a guaranteed income stream for life, which is attractive for risk-averse individuals or those without pensions. However, they require a significant upfront investment, reducing liquidity, and can come with complex terms and fees, making them unsuitable for everyone's financial situation.

          <h2>Freed Israeli Hostage Criticizes UK Plan to Recognize Palestinian State</h2>

          <p>A freed British-Israeli hostage, Doron Katz-Asher, has strongly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing the move "risks rewarding terror." She contends that such a decision sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy and could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. Her statement reflects concerns from other hostage families that the UK's political maneuver could prolong the conflict rather than advance peace. The UK government announced the plan due to the "intolerable situation" in Gaza and to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>Countries along the Pacific coast of South America, including Chile and Peru, have issued high-level tsunami warnings and evacuation orders following the major earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. While the immediate threat has subsided in regions like Japan and Hawaii, the tsunami is now approaching South America, prompting authorities to declare red alerts and close coastal areas. Chile has ordered evacuations on Easter Island and its mainland coast, with President Gabriel Boric urging calm and adherence to official instructions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter of 2025, a significant rebound from the 0.5% contraction in the first three months of the year. The Commerce Department report shows this growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile factor linked to the Trump administration's trade policies. While consumer spending also accelerated, a key underlying measure of private domestic demand showed its weakest growth since 2022. Economists caution that the headline GDP figure overstates the economy's true strength, suggesting a broader slowdown is underway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of high-income American households are struggling to keep up with their debts, with delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans more than doubling since 2023 for those earning over $150,000. According to VantageScore, this trend signals that even wealthier individuals are feeling the strain from a weaker white-collar job market and high housing costs. While overall delinquency rates remain highest for lower-income groups, the rate of increase is fastest among top earners. This development raises concerns about consumer spending, the main driver of the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The children, both under the age of 12, were reportedly at the facility waiting for the employee to go to a doctor's appointment when the blast occurred. The explosion tore apart the plant's structure and started a fire that smoldered for nearly a day, preventing rescue crews from accessing the building. The incident has been declared a tragedy by the city's mayor, and efforts at the scene have now shifted from rescue to recovery.</p>

The timing is notable, as Doncic is now eligible to sign a lucrative contract extension with the Lakers, with his commitment to conditioning likely reassuring the team.</p>

          <p>A startup named Quaise Energy is developing an advanced form of geothermal power that could help meet the massive energy demands of the AI era. The technology uses an electromagnetic beam to drill up to 12 miles deep, accessing "superhot" rocks to extract five to ten times more power per well than traditional geothermal methods. By reaching temperatures over 930 degrees Fahrenheit, this method promises a consistent, carbon-free energy source. Quaise, which spun out of MIT, plans to pilot its first superhot power plant by 2028, offering a potential solution for clean, scalable energy.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old from Edinburgh has been sentenced to six years in jail for plotting a mass shooting at his school. The court heard that Felix Winter, who was 15 and 16 when the offenses occurred, idolized the Columbine killers and held racist, pro-Nazi views. He had spent over 1,000 hours in contact with an extremist online group and detailed his violent plans in a journal. The judge noted that Winter was progressing toward perpetrating an attack and that his stated intent was clear.
