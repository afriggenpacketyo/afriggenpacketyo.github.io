          <p>The stock market experienced a downturn following President Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Apple and the European Union, sparking concerns about global economic growth and trade relations. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all closed lower, with Apple's stock particularly affected due to potential tariffs on iPhones produced abroad. An analyst noted that the uncertainty caused by these tariff threats is detrimental to global growth and market stability. With key tariff pauses set to expire soon, economists predict continued market volatility, influenced by rising debt and trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight individuals were found guilty by a Paris court for their involvement in the 2016 robbery of Kim Kardashian during Paris Fashion Week, where millions of dollars worth of jewelry were stolen. The court handed down sentences ranging from three to eight years, with most suspended due to the defendants' ages and health issues. Kardashian, who testified during the trial, expressed gratitude to French authorities and stated the incident was a terrifying experience with lasting impacts, though she believes in healing and accountability. The robbers, dubbed the "Grandpa robbers," were mostly in their 60s and 70s, with only two acknowledging their involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued that the administration's decision, which accused the university of fostering an unsafe environment and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, violated the First Amendment. The judge's order preserves the status quo pending a hearing, while the White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach. The university's president, Alan Garber, condemned the administration's actions as an unlawful attempt to control Harvard's academic independence.</p>

N.P.H. is a rare condition involving excess cerebrospinal fluid buildup in the brain, which can cause gait, bladder, and cognitive problems. Early diagnosis and treatment, often through surgery, can alleviate symptoms, though later stages may result in irreversible effects.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, the contributor argues that the shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers in Washington is a consequence of the dehumanization of Jews and supporters of Israel. The author suggests that calls for Jewish genocide, particularly those made on American campuses, should be taken seriously and literally. The piece contrasts this with the way Trump's social media posts are often interpreted and claims that politically motivated violence is not an equivalent problem on both the left and the right. The author urges an end to open calls for murder and genocide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Apple must pay a tariff of 25% or more on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, particularly in India. Trump's demand follows increased pressure on Apple to increase domestic manufacturing, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasizing the need to secure the semiconductor supply chain. Apple, which is already facing tariff costs, has not commented on the latest demand. The company has been shifting some production to India, but Trump insists that iPhones sold in the U.S. should be made domestically. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trade and logistics experts caution that President Trump's tariff threats against the European Union could backfire, potentially harming key trade relationships and U.S. industrial operations. While Trump aims to pressure the EU into more favorable trade negotiations, the proposed 50% tariff risks disrupting the recovery of freight orders and increasing production costs for American manufacturers. Unlike Asia, which primarily supplies consumer products, Europe is a major source of industrial products crucial for U.S. manufacturing. Reduced trade with the EU could also raise export rates for American products, further escalating economic harm. (not investment advice)</p>
