          <p>China showcased advanced stealth drones, including the GJ-11, during a recent military parade, prompting global military observers to speculate extensively on their strategic capabilities. These uncrewed aircraft are widely believed to possess cutting-edge features like hypersonic cruising, significantly improved stealth technology, and elevated air combat power, signaling a transformative shift in future aerial warfare. State media highlighted their potential for precise stealth strikes, wide-area surveillance, and sophisticated autonomous coordination, creating a new paradigm for military operations. This significant development underscores China's ambitious efforts to redefine modern military aviation and project its growing technological prowess on the global stage, raising considerable implications for international defense strategies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has petitioned the Supreme Court to pause the reinstatement of Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, whom lower courts ordered reinstated after his termination. Trump asserts his authority to remove executive agency heads, citing recent Supreme Court decisions that he believes vindicate his actions in such matters. However, Slaughter, who was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to a term ending in 2029, is challenging her firing as illegal, arguing that federal law requires "cause" for FTC commissioner removals. This ongoing legal battle represents a critical test of presidential power versus the independence of federal regulatory bodies.</p>

The former Iowa standout expressed profound disappointment over not returning to play, yet she remains proud of her team's resilience through adversity. Her absence is a significant blow to the Fever's playoff aspirations, especially as the team has already lost several other key players to injuries this season. Despite her limited on-court presence, Clark is widely credited with substantially boosting women's basketball viewership and attendance across both collegiate and professional leagues.</p>

Newsom condemned the move as "waste, fraud and abuse" and "political theater," highlighting the strain on guard members and their families.

          <p>Tattoos have seen a major increase in prevalence, with a third of American adults now having at least one, and over 40% among millennials. This rise reflects a growing openness towards individuality and self-expression, moving beyond past associations with rebellious personalities. Despite their mainstream embrace and recognition as an art form, significant stigma still exists, impacting job prospects and trust in various professional settings. Efforts like art exhibits featuring tattoo artists aim to challenge these misconceptions, though about a quarter of people still regret at least one of their tattoos, indicating personal evolution.</p>

          <p>DeKalb County School District in Georgia has implemented a "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, banning student cellphone use during school hours, yielding positive results. Teachers at Lakeside High School reported a significant improvement in the learning environment and student engagement, with a noticeable decrease in disruptions and an increase in grades. This initiative aligns with a growing national trend, as over half of U.S. states now regulate or ban cellphones in schools, with Georgia enacting a K-8 ban for 2026. The program highlights the benefits of reducing digital distractions in educational settings, fostering better academic focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, and Police Commissioner Michael Cox, alleging that Boston's sanctuary city policies violate federal law by obstructing immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Boston's policies undermine law enforcement and protect "illegal aliens," endangering public safety. Mayor Wu called the lawsuit an "unconstitutional attack," vowing to vigorously defend the city's laws, which she asserts make immigration a federal responsibility. This action is part of a broader Trump administration effort to challenge sanctuary policies nationwide.</p>

The summit aimed to solidify support for Kyiv, particularly amidst concerns regarding President Trump's evolving stance on the conflict.

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's order to shut down "Alligator Alcatraz," an immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, allowing it to remain operational. The court ruled that state and federal officials would likely succeed in arguing the facility was not subject to federal environmental reviews, as it had not yet received federal funding. Governor Ron DeSantis and the Department of Homeland Security welcomed the decision, framing it as a victory for law enforcement and border security efforts. Environmental groups and a Native American tribe, who contend the facility threatens ancestral land, expressed disappointment but vowed to continue their legal challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political analyst Sir John Curtice details Reform UK's dramatic ascent, now leading polls for five months and potentially poised to become the largest party in the next general election. The party's success is largely attributed to widespread public dissatisfaction with slow economic growth, the National Health Service, and high immigration, particularly among Brexit voters who feel unrepresented by traditional parties. Nigel Farage's leadership is a significant draw, and Reform has effectively captured a large portion of the 2019 Conservative Leave vote. This analysis suggests Reform's unique appeal to socially conservative, climate-skeptic voters could be decisive in a fragmented political landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa stated that financial restrictions "killed" the club's summer transfer window, limiting their ability to sign new players. Villa faced fines from UEFA for breaching financial rules and must adhere to Profit and Sustainability Rules, capping losses at £105 million over three years. Despite selling Jacob Ramsey for £40 million, their only major permanent signing was Evann Guessand. The club ultimately brought in three loan players on deadline day to navigate these financial constraints, leaving the team with a challenging start to the season and impacting their competitive edge.</p>
