          <p>A trio of cryptocurrency regulation bills has advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives following a record-setting 10-hour vote. The process was stalled by opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, raising doubts about the party's ability to pass a final version of the legislation. The crypto industry, which has significantly funded lawmakers, faced a letdown during what was intended to be a productive "Crypto Week." The prolonged stalemate also highlighted questions about former President Trump's influence over party members. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has announced an agreement on "specific steps" to end deadly sectarian violence in southern Syria's Suweida province. The announcement came as Israel's military conducted airstrikes on the Syrian defense ministry in Damascus and other government targets. The clashes, which have reportedly killed over 300 people, involve Druze militias and Bedouin tribes, with Syrian government forces also involved. Israel stated its actions were to protect the Druze population, while Syria condemned the strikes as "treacherous aggression."</p>

          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted over 7% after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion acquisition bid. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i expressed disappointment, refuting the Canadian firm's claims and stating the withdrawal was unilateral. Analysts suggest that Japanese protectionism and the company's classification as core to national security made the deal highly unlikely from the start. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted for the second straight month in June, falling 0.5% year-over-year and fueling concerns of a potential recession.

The data comes as Japan faces a 25% U.S. tariff on its imports, with no trade deal in sight.

Homicide convictions accounted for less than 0.6% of deportees, while known or suspected gang members or terrorists made up about 3.3%.

          <p>A potential move by President Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell would cause significant market turmoil, according to analysts. The scenario would likely trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, creating a messy situation for the economy. While the President has publicly downplayed the likelihood, his ongoing criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates keeps the possibility alive.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling it a wasteful and cruel tactic aimed at punishing immigrants. His comments came after the Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of half the troops, a move Newsom suggested was due to the administration realizing the absurdity of the deployment. The governor claimed the effort wasted hundreds of millions of dollars to appear "tough" while terrorizing communities, rather than focusing on actual violent criminals. He also repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional districts to favor Democrats if Republicans pursue similar efforts elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Recent federal workplace raids are highlighting major flaws in the E-Verify system, the program used by over a million employers to confirm work eligibility. The article profiles a Nebraska business owner who used the system diligently yet was still raided, with agents revealing that many of his employees had used stolen identities. Experts argue that E-Verify primarily vets paperwork, not people, making it easy to fool with legitimate documents belonging to someone else. This broken "wink-and-nod" system not only fails to stop unauthorized employment but also makes employers and identity theft victims vulnerable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation aimed at preventing thousands of U.S. veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a key homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with few affordable options if they fell behind on mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move missed payments to the end of their loan term, enabling them to become current and stay in their homes. Lawmakers are now urging the VA to implement the new program quickly.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after she strategically left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became lost after their car's GPS led them deep into the Stanislaus National Forest, where they lost their signal. The notes, along with the son's periodic whistle blows, guided the volunteer search-and-rescue team to their location. Rescuers used ham radio to communicate the successful find from the dense forest, highlighting how both cleverness and old-fashioned technology were key to the positive outcome.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which provides federal funds for projects like flood control systems. The states contend that this decision, which threatens hundreds of community projects, is an overreach of executive power and that only Congress can make such a change. A recent analysis showed the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

Shareholders are seeking to have Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs incurred due to the privacy fallout.

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called on the Trump administration to release all files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. In a direct contradiction to President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a "hoax," Pence emphasized the importance of getting the facts to the American people while protecting the names of victims. Pence's remarks highlight a significant split with the president on a highly sensitive issue. The Justice Department recently concluded its review, identifying over 1,000 victims but finding no evidence of a "client list."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid is facing intense scrutiny, as experts and former officials say there is little evidence to support claims of widespread "waste, fraud and abuse." The former inspector general for USAID stated that the handful of examples cited by the administration were "completely made up." Internal sources allege the review process was a "surface level" search for politically charged keywords like "gender" or "climate," rather than a thorough investigation into program effectiveness. The move has been criticized as politically motivated and lacking transparency.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has now reached £1,076 per child, according to new research from the charity Coram. Prices have risen significantly, with some regions seeing hikes of up to 13% compared to last year, driven by high demand and a lack of cheaper council-run options. The rising costs place a heavy financial burden on working parents who rely on this care, with many families struggling to pay the large upfront fees. The issue is compounded by a lack of sufficient places, especially for older children and those with special needs.</p>

The piece highlights a whistleblower's claim that Bove encouraged lawyers to defy court orders to advance the administration's deportation drive.
