The motion claims that this attorney has also ignored the Menendez family members in her official capacity and did not warn them of gruesome imagery from the murder scene that would be displayed during an April 11 hearing in the resentencing proceedings.

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is examining Israel's obligation to ensure humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. The case follows a request by the UN General Assembly to determine if Israel breached the UN Charter by banning cooperation with UNRWA. The UN organization significantly contributes to providing food aid, health care, and education in the occupied Palestinian territories. This comes as the UN humanitarian agency OCHA called the situation in Gaza "probably the worst" it has been in the 18 months since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas.

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance since the Nixon administration, with the S&P 500 dropping 7.9%. This decline contrasts with the initial post-election rally driven by hopes for tax cuts and deregulation. The market downturn is attributed to Trump's aggressive approach to trade, raising concerns about inflation and a potential recession. Concerns remain about further downside, with continuing uncertainty in Washington. (optimism score is 35)</p>
