          <p>Meta Platforms has launched a standalone artificial intelligence app powered by its Llama AI model, directly challenging OpenAI's ChatGPT and other AI platforms like Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini. The new app includes a Discover feed for user interaction and image creation capabilities. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions Meta AI reaching over a billion users in 2025, with the app already boasting approximately 700 million monthly active users as of January. This move mirrors similar efforts by Google and xAI, as Meta increases its AI infrastructure investments to $65 billion this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Palestinian paramedic, Assad al-Nassasra, detained during a deadly Israeli attack in Gaza that killed 15 emergency workers, has been released after 37 days in detention. The Israeli military confirmed holding Mr. Nassasra during an internal inquiry briefing that identified "several professional failures." The PRCS denounced the findings as an attempt to justify a "war crime," as eight PRCS paramedics, six first responders from Gaza's Civil Defence agency, and one UN employee were killed in the attack. The military said the deputy commander of the reconnaissance battalion was dismissed "due to his responsibilities as the field commander in this incident and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief."</p>

Vereb is accused of stealing over $650,000 from more than 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024. Investigators claim that Vereb collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from pet owners who were promised private cremations, but instead, he discarded the pets at a landfill and provided customers with ashes from unknown animals.

          <p>Canadian Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to lose his parliamentary seat to Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy, marking a significant shift in Canadian politics. This defeat comes after a period where Poilievre was expected to succeed former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The election cycle was significantly influenced by President Donald Trump's tariff policies and comments about potentially making Canada the 51st state. Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy, who is projected to take Poilievre’s seat in Parliament, worked in business and marketing and lives in a carbon-neutral house in Manotick, a suburb of Ottawa, according to CBC.</p>

          <p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has criticized Amazon for allegedly planning to display the cost of tariff-related price increases on its products, labeling it a "hostile and political action."

          <p>The Vietnam War, ending 50 years ago, fundamentally altered the understanding of war's long-term psychological and social consequences, including the recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While PTSD treatment has advanced in the West, Vietnam has largely suppressed discussions of psychological trauma due to the Communist Party's focus on heroic narratives. The war's legacy extends beyond individual trauma to societal dimensions, including remembrance rituals, popular narratives, reconciliation efforts, and acknowledgement of atrocities.

          <p>The recent massacre of 26 people in Kashmir has reignited tensions between India and Pakistan, with the cost primarily borne by Kashmiris. For nearly four decades, Kashmir has gone through cycles of violence, relative calm, and declarations of normality, only to revert to conflict. The people of Kashmir have had little or no say in their future, and the region remains heavily militarized. The article highlights the growing resentment among Kashmiris due to their dispossession and disempowerment, as well as the lack of representation and suppressed anger at the growing powerlessness and the humiliating deprivation of agency.</p>

While Europe prioritizes energy security by doing business with countries like Russia, Libya, and Qatar, the political and diplomatic complexities surrounding Iran prevent a similar approach. Experts suggest that a political solution is needed to reverse the situation, but the ongoing Iran-US nuclear talks offer little hope for a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Dramatic cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under the Trump administration could significantly alter the agency's role in consumer protection. With the agency potentially being pared back to a 200-person staff, many of its recent efforts, such as capping bank overdraft fees and regulating payment apps, are at risk of being overturned or left in doubt. The CFPB has also been dropping lawsuits it previously filed, creating uncertainty for both consumers and companies.

          <p>The Vietnam War was the first "living room war," seen on TV and through remarkable photography, forever changing how Americans viewed their country, soldiers, and the war itself. Photojournalists captured war’s most personal moments, the best and worst of human nature. Their work reshaped politics and amplified opposition to the war. The images changed how the world saw Vietnam, but especially how Americans saw their country, soldiers and the war itself, which ended 50 years ago this month. The most memorable photographs of that era, with its grisly, muddy, cruel jungle war, were shot by a brave global crew with a wide range of political views and backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched 100 attack drones across Ukraine overnight, killing a child and wounding several people, hours after President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral three-day cease-fire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed the cease-fire announcement as a manipulation, calling for an immediate, full, and unconditional 30-day cease-fire. The Kremlin stated that it would not agree to a longer cease-fire without addressing more details. The attacks come after President Trump expressed frustration with Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine, questioning whether Putin truly wanted peace.</p>
