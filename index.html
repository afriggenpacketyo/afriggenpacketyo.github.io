          <h2>Senate Fails to Block Trump's 'Liberation Day' Tariffs Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate fell short in an effort to block President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs due to Republican opposition, despite anxieties over potential economic disruption. The resolution, led by Democratic and Republican senators, aimed to terminate the national emergency declaration used to impose the tariffs, but it lacked the necessary votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed reluctance to interfere early in the tariff policy's implementation, although anxieties about the economic impact of the tariffs persist, as indicated by a slowdown in first-quarter economic growth. The vote is largely symbolic as the House is unlikely to take up the measure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly contacted El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, regarding the detention of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly deported to a Salvadoran prison. Despite a Supreme Court order to 'facilitate' Ábrego García's release, Bukele rejected the outreach, leading to no new developments. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to confirm the discussions, emphasizing executive control over foreign policy, and President Trump deflected responsibility by stating his lawyers advised against contacting Bukele. A federal judge refused to extend a pause in discovery proceedings, ordering the Justice Department to respond to questions about Ábrego García's detention, potentially leading to further scrutiny of the administration's compliance with the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

          <p>A court found that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction from the Epic Games case and that an Apple executive lied under oath regarding the company's decision to levy a 27% fee on certain App Store purchases. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings against both the executive and Apple. The ruling accuses Apple of anticompetitive behavior and withholding documentation, ordering the company to cease imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the decision as a victory for developers, forcing Apple to compete.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, with the gross domestic product shrinking at an annual rate of 0.3%, primarily due to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. This slowdown has fueled concerns that the tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, potentially leading to a recession. Economists caution that the figures may be skewed due to the surge in imports, but the data signals that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025. Government spending also declined significantly, impacting the overall growth.</p>

          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs faced by landlords. The preliminary vote backs increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent on two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates argue the increases will harm lower-income New Yorkers, while landlords claim the increases are insufficient to cover rising expenses.

          <p>The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, had filed a protective order against him in 2021 alleging domestic violence. The protective order was dismissed after Vasquez did not attend the final hearing. The Trump administration has admitted to the deportation error but claims Abrego Garcia is not a sympathetic figure, citing Vasquez's protective order. The case has led to legal battles, with the Supreme Court requiring the administration to facilitate his release, though the case has appeared to languish.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been characterized by aggressive trade policies, expansionist ambitions, and a hands-off approach to longstanding conflicts. Trade wars have expanded globally, with tariffs used to coerce foreign governments and tensions rising between the U.S. and China. The administration has pursued control of the Panama Canal and Greenland, while also engaging in negotiations with Ukraine and brokering peace talks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite promises to resolve conflicts, some efforts have stalled, and the administration has faced criticism for its approach to Russia and Ukraine.</p>
