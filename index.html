          <p>Russia has launched its largest drone and missile attack of the war, striking multiple locations across Ukraine and killing at least nine civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed that the cabinet building in Kyiv was among the targets, sustaining damage to its upper floors. Ukraine's air force reported that it shot down most of the 823 munitions, but dozens still impacted targets. The attack prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets in Poland and has led to renewed calls from Ukrainian leaders for increased international military assistance.</p>

          <p>Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation following a significant parliamentary election defeat in July for his ruling coalition. The decision came after growing pressure from within his own Liberal Democratic Party to take responsibility for the loss. Ishiba had initially resisted calls to step down, citing the need for political stability, but ultimately conceded ahead of a party vote that was widely seen as a no-confidence motion. His departure will trigger a party leadership election to choose his successor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially renamed the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War, via an executive order. Supporters, including the newly titled Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, argue the change brings honesty and clarity to the military's primary function. However, critics and some former officials contend the move is reckless, risks glorifying conflict, and could provide propaganda material for adversaries. The debate highlights a fundamental disagreement over whether the name change is a meaningful cultural reset or merely symbolic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have surged to record highs, gaining approximately 35% this year amid economic uncertainty and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Experts suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking physical gold are a liquid and low-cost way for investors to gain exposure to the precious metal. These are often preferred over owning physical bullion due to lower transaction and storage costs. Financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Simon Tisdall argues that global leaders who attempt to placate or befriend Donald Trump consistently fail to achieve their strategic goals. The author points to examples involving leaders from India, France, and the EU, suggesting that Trump's transactional and personal style of diplomacy does not reward loyalty. The article contends that a stance of firm resolve and resistance is a more effective approach when dealing with the US president. It serves as a cautionary note to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer ahead of Trump's upcoming state visit.</p>
