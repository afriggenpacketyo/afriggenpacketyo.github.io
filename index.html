          <p>Gap's stock experienced a significant drop in extended trading despite the company reporting mixed financial results for its fiscal second quarter. While earnings per share surpassed Wall Street's expectations, revenue fell slightly short of projections. The primary driver of investor concern was Gap's updated guidance, which warned that increased tariffs are now expected to cost the company between $150 million and $175 million, negatively impacting its future profits and operating margin. This cautionary outlook overshadowed more positive developments, such as continued comparable sales growth across its main brands and a strong cash position, highlighting the precarious retail environment.

          <p>Four high-ranking officials who resigned in protest from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led a rally across from the agency's Atlanta headquarters, drawing cheers from hundreds of supporters. The officials, including former Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry and vaccine program leader Demetre Daskalakis, publicly decried what they described as pervasive political interference and the spread of misinformation under the current administration. In their speeches, they passionately called for science and data to be the sole guides for public health decisions, vowing to become the agency's "loudest advocates" from the outside. The event underscored the escalating turmoil and plummeting morale within the CDC following the contentious firing of its director.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent leadership exodus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stems from a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and scientific integrity under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Resigning officials cited the "weaponizing of public health," pointing to Kennedy's overhaul of federal health agencies, gutting of a key vaccine advisory panel, and changes to immunization schedules without scientific consensus. This article provides context on the turmoil, explaining how these actions have eroded trust within the agency and raised alarms among public health experts about the nation's ability to respond to future disease outbreaks. The situation is compounded by recent funding cuts and a violent attack on the agency's headquarters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mentions of employee burnout reach their highest levels since 2016, a lifestyle expert provides actionable advice for reducing stress on the job. The recommendations focus on energy management, suggesting that workers should tackle demanding tasks during their high-energy morning hours and save simpler activities like answering emails for later in the day. The expert also advocates for building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief without leaving the desk. A crucial component of this strategy is setting firm boundaries and learning to say "no" when necessary to prioritize personal well-being.</p>

          <p>In a surprising and significant move, the Dallas Cowboys have traded All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. The blockbuster deal marks a major shift for both NFC franchises ahead of the season. Parsons confirmed the trade on social media with a statement that hinted at difficulties during contract negotiations with the Cowboys' front office and owner Jerry Jones. He expressed that while he wished to remain in Dallas, the decision was not entirely within his control, stating he only sought fairness in the negotiation process.

          <p>Robert Primus, a Democratic member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), was abruptly fired by the Trump administration, a move he discovered after his work phone was locked upon returning from an Amtrak event. Primus, who intends to fight the ouster, stated no cause was given for his termination. His removal has drawn condemnation from rail worker unions, who suggest the timing is suspicious given the STB's ongoing review of a major proposed merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. This action is part of a series of high-profile dismissals by the administration, contributing to concerns about the independence of federal regulatory agencies.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump to prevent her removal from the central bank's board, with a hearing scheduled for Friday. The lawsuit challenges Trump's unprecedented attempt to fire a Fed governor "for cause," based on allegations of mortgage fraud that Cook's attorney calls "nakedly pretextual." The suit argues that the move subverts the Federal Reserve Act, which is designed to protect the board's independence from political pressure. This legal battle, which could reach the Supreme Court, highlights the administration's efforts to influence the central bank's interest rate policies and potentially reshape its composition.</p>

The author contends that Article II of the Constitution vests the entire "executive power," including the removal of officers, in the president. The article posits that so-called "independent" agencies like the Federal Reserve are an unconstitutional fourth branch of government, and Supreme Court precedent is trending toward restoring presidential removal power. The author asserts that even if a "for cause" justification is needed, allegations of mortgage fraud against a top banking regulator are a legitimate reason, necessary to preserve the Fed's integrity.</p>

The ruling found that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles played by specific individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers.

          <p>Authorities have revealed that the 23-year-old suspect in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, Robin Westman, expressed intense hatred towards nearly every imaginable group in extensive writings. While a specific motive for targeting the school remains under investigation, police confirmed Westman was a former student and had a "deranged obsession with previous mass shooters." The U.S. Attorney for Minnesota stated the shooter appeared to hate everyone except other mass murderers and, above all, wanted to kill and watch children suffer. This new information paints a disturbing picture of the shooter's mindset, focusing on a desire for notoriety through an act of immense violence rather than a specific grievance.</p>

          <p>This article provides a summary of the key facts surrounding the deadly shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, where two children were killed and over a dozen others injured. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, was a former student of the school and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene after firing from outside the church. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. An analysis of the shooter's online videos and notebooks reveals extensive planning, racist and antisemitic messages, and a desire to cause a "devastating tragedy."</p>

The recall affects 2015-2018 Ford Edge and 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX SUV models. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a flexible hose in the rear brake system can rupture, which may result in increased brake pedal travel and longer stopping distances.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve are concerning, the larger and more enduring threat to the central bank's independence is fiscal dominance. The author explains that as public debt grows, the Fed becomes increasingly constrained by Congress's fiscal decisions, potentially forcing it to keep interest rates low to manage the government's borrowing costs. This dynamic subordinates monetary policy to fiscal needs, a situation exacerbated by today's high debt levels. The article concludes that without meaningful budgetary reforms from Congress, the pressure on the Fed will persist regardless of who is president, making true operational independence impossible.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues for specific legal reforms to prevent individuals with documented mental health crises from obtaining guns, using recent mass shootings as examples. The author points out that in many states, an emergency psychiatric hold for being a danger to oneself or others does not prohibit a person from later buying a firearm. The article advocates for states and the federal government to implement temporary, reviewable firearm prohibitions following such holds, similar to policies in California and Washington. Additionally, it calls for closing a loophole that allows concealed-carry permit holders to bypass background checks for up to five years, a period during which their mental state could drastically change.</p>

          <p>After dominant performances in the early rounds of the US Open, British tennis players Emma Raducanu and Cameron Norrie are set for significant challenges against elite opponents. Raducanu, who has shown consistent progress in recent months, will face Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion and one of the most powerful players on the tour. This match will serve as a key benchmark for Raducanu's improved game. Meanwhile, Norrie is slated to play against tennis legend Novak Djokovic for the seventh time, hoping his improved physical conditioning will help him challenge the Serbian star more effectively than in their previous encounters.</p>

          <p>Senator Bill Cassidy, the leading Republican on the Senate's health committee, has called for the indefinite postponement of a key vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for next month. His request to the Department of Health and Human Services comes in response to the recent turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the ouster of its director and the resignation of several top officials. Cassidy stated that any recommendations made by the committee would lack legitimacy given the current leadership crisis and allegations about the meeting's agenda and lack of scientific process.

          <p>In the aftermath of the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School where two children were killed, Minneapolis police have stated that locked church doors were a critical factor in preventing an even greater tragedy. The shooter, 23-year-old Robin Westman, was unable to gain entry into the building and instead fired through the windows from outside. Investigators believe Westman, a former student, had planned to barricade the exits and carry out the attack from inside the church. This crucial detail highlights how basic security measures likely saved numerous lives by thwarting the shooter's original, more devastating plan.</p>

          <p>South Carolina officials have filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to allow full enforcement of a state policy that restricts transgender students from using restrooms that align with their gender identity. This legal move seeks to overturn a lower court's injunction that protected a specific transgender high school student from the rule. The state policy makes a portion of school funding contingent on enforcing that restrooms designated for one sex are used only by individuals of that biological sex. The state argues that the policy reflects the will of the legislature and is necessary to protect student privacy.</p>

The initiative aims to enhance convenience and close the competitive gap with traditional grocers like Walmart and Kroger.

The goal is to reignite the brand's innovation pipeline and reconnect more deeply with athletes and consumers.
