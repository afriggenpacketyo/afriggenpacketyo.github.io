In total, thirteen people were shot during the incident, which occurred early Saturday morning with over 150 people in attendance. The Robeson County Sheriff’s Office has stated that the shooting appears to be an isolated event with no ongoing threat to the community.

          <p>Police in India have arrested a man for allegedly stalking and inappropriately touching two Australian women cricketers during the ICC Women's World Cup. The incident occurred in the city of Indore when the players were walking from their hotel to a cafe. According to police, the accused, who has a prior criminal record, followed the players on a motorcycle before the assault. India's cricket board described the event as "deeply regrettable and isolated" and has committed to reviewing and strengthening its safety protocols to prevent future occurrences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A four-year study conducted in Southern California has found a link between E. coli from contaminated meat and nearly 20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) among patients. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the E. coli strains in patients back to meat samples from local grocery stores, with turkey and chicken being the most common sources. The findings suggest that contaminated meat is not just a food safety issue but a significant contributor to common infections that can become life-threatening. The study also highlighted a higher risk for individuals in lower-income areas, prompting calls for stronger food safety regulations.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London is undertaking a massive review of 9,000 child sexual exploitation cases spanning a 15-year period. This initiative follows a national report which concluded that group-based child sexual exploitation was more widespread and organized than previously understood. The force stated that the review includes various forms of abuse, not just those fitting the description of 'grooming gangs,' and aims to address past failures. Since 2022, the Met has reportedly improved its investigation methods, resulting in a threefold increase in solved cases of this nature.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed President Trump's recent demolition of the White House's historic East Wing to construct a new ballroom. Commentators expressed shock at the rapid destruction of a structure holding significant historical and public memory. The move was framed as another example of the president disregarding established norms and presidential traditions. Panelists suggested the action symbolizes a rejection of checks and balances, deeply unsettling those who admire the institution of the presidency and the White House itself.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has built a clothing resale business that generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. Starting in 2008 as an unemployed single father, Senko began by flipping used electronics on eBay before transitioning to pre-owned clothing. He eventually shifted his model from individual online sales to a wholesale business called Technsports, which sells bulk used clothing to other resellers. Senko attributes his success to relentless hard work, studying market trends, and building strong relationships with suppliers over nearly two decades in the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child life specialist and therapist advises that saying "no" to children should be part of a broader strategy to teach safety, regulation, and connection. Instead of simple prohibition, parents should explain the reasoning behind boundaries and offer choices to give children a sense of autonomy. For example, rather than just saying "stop," a parent could say "gentle hands" to guide behavior positively. The article emphasizes that consistency is key, as it helps children feel secure, and it is important for parents to repair the connection after a reactive or emotional "no."</p>

          <p>Demonstrations are taking place across Germany in response to comments made by Chancellor Friedrich Merz regarding urban migration, which critics have labeled as divisive. In Hamburg, thousands protested under the banner "We are the cityscape!," accusing Merz's CDU party of adopting rhetoric similar to the far-right AfD. Conversely, a recent survey indicates that a majority of the public agrees with the Chancellor's statement that there are problems in the urban landscape. The controversy has sparked a national debate about migration, social cohesion, and political discourse in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jimmy John Liautaud, the billionaire founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, has stated that the concept of work-life balance for entrepreneurs is "the biggest line of bulls--- that’s ever been created." He argues that creating a successful business from nothing requires an intense, all-consuming work ethic without compromise. Liautaud, who grew his company from a single shop in 1983 to a multi-billion dollar brand, believes that true entrepreneurs must be prepared to be "a grinder" and work 24/7. His perspective aligns with the workaholic mentalities of other successful founders like Bill Gates and Elon Musk in their early days.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 Picasso portrait of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has sold for approximately $37 million at an auction in Paris. The painting, titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," had not been seen by the public for over 80 years, remaining in a private family collection since 1944. The work captures Maar at a painful juncture in their relationship as it was ending. The final sale price surpassed auction estimates and marked the highest price paid for an artwork in France this year, hailed by the auctioneer as an "enormous success."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated he would like China's help in resolving the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump mentioned his good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and suggested that Xi could have a significant influence on Vladimir Putin. This diplomatic approach comes after Trump's frustration with a lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations and the recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions on major Russian oil companies. Despite China being a key ally of Russia, Trump plans to discuss the war with Xi during their upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>The NHS is urging parents in England to get their children vaccinated against the flu, citing an early start to the season and a worrying increase in cases and hospitalizations, particularly among children. Health officials emphasize that the flu virus can spread rapidly in schools and cause serious illness. While many children have received the vaccine at school, options like GP surgeries, pharmacies, and pop-up clinics are available for those who have not. The vaccine, typically administered as a nasal spray for children, is described as the best way to protect them from the virus.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant decrease in the number of active serial killers since the 1970s, public fascination with the topic persists, as seen in recent unsubstantiated rumors in cities like Austin, Texas. Criminologists attribute the real-world decline to factors such as advanced DNA technology, increased public awareness, and fewer opportunities for predators. However, this reality contrasts with a surge in popular entertainment about infamous murderers who sexually assaulted and killed their victims. This cultural obsession suggests society's need for "monsters" to understand the boundaries of human behavior, even as the nature of violent crime evolves.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the Caribbean. This move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, which Washington claims is part of a counter-narcotics operation. However, Caracas fears the buildup is a precursor to an attempt to overthrow Maduro's government, which the U.S. does not recognize as legitimate. The deployment follows a series of U.S. air strikes on vessels and President Trump's suggestions of potential "land action" in Venezuela.</p>

Beijing's official commemoration of "Taiwan Restoration Day" is viewed as a strategic move to reinforce its claim of sovereignty over the self-governed island.
