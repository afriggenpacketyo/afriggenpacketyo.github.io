          <p>This opinion article by Alex de Waal argues that the food distribution system in Gaza, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is a facade that fails to address mass starvation. The author contends that the aid provided is numerically insufficient, poorly targeted, and lacks essential items like therapeutic food for malnourished children. The system is described as forcing desperate people into dangerous situations to get rations, ultimately undermining Palestinian society rather than providing genuine humanitarian relief and dignity.</p>

          <p>This article chronicles the story of a 25-year-old Cuban woman who, after legally entering the U.S. and attending her immigration hearing, was abruptly detained by ICE agents in an El Paso courthouse. Despite a judge scheduling her next asylum hearing for 2026, she was apprehended, reflecting a broader pattern of increased courthouse arrests under the Trump administration. The incident highlights the fear and uncertainty faced by migrants navigating the U.S. legal system, even when they appear to be following official procedures.</p>

          <p>Rapper Snoop Dogg has collaborated with the country group Zac Brown Band on a new song titled "Let It Run." Describing the mashup as "gangster gumbo," Snoop Dogg emphasized that cross-genre collaborations bring people together through the universal language of music. This is not his first venture into country, as he has previously worked with artists like Willie Nelson and Ernest, viewing country as a form of hip-hop. The collaboration highlights a growing trend of artists blending different musical styles to create unique sounds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a paradox where home prices have hit a record high even as sales numbers have slowed significantly. This trend is largely driven by high-end, all-cash buyers who can afford the steep prices, while elevated mortgage rates sideline many first-time and middle-income buyers. The market is strongest at the top, with homes priced over $1 million seeing the largest sales spike, creating what experts call a "haves and have-nots" scenario. This situation underscores the affordability crisis and the growing wealth gap affecting access to homeownership. (not investment advice)</p>

Key disagreements remain over the integration of Kurdish fighters into the national army and control over their autonomous region's resources and borders. The situation is complicated by Turkey, which fiercely opposes Kurdish autonomy and has warned against any attempts to divide Syria. This creates a volatile geopolitical landscape for the Kurdish minority, caught between Damascus, Ankara, and their own aspirations for self-governance.</p>

          <p>A double-decker bus traveling from Lima, Peru, crashed into a ravine, resulting in the deaths of at least 15 people and injuring approximately 30 others. The bus, carrying over 60 passengers, went off the road in the Palca district and landed on its roof near a river. Authorities are investigating the cause of the accident, which highlights the ongoing issue of frequent and deadly road incidents in Peru, often attributed to reckless driving, excessive speed, and poor road conditions in the mountainous country.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly condemned the Hong Kong authorities for offering cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists living in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries described the move as an act of "transnational repression" and a threat to the rights and safety of individuals in the UK. The UK reaffirmed its commitment to protecting those who have moved from Hong Kong and has taken steps to sever extradition ties in response to the security situation.</p>
