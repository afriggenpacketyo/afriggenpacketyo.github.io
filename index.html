          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the widely used FICO credit score, experienced a significant stock rally of over 20% following the announcement of a new pricing model. This innovative model will enable mortgage lenders to directly license credit scores, effectively bypassing the traditional role of credit bureaus. The strategic shift is intended to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups on FICO scores, offering greater flexibility and choice to lenders in their mortgage decisions. While this development signals positive economic prospects for FICO, it led to a notable decline in the stock values of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director praised the initiative as a "Creative Solution" aimed at benefiting American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While many voters perceive Democrats as not doing enough to oppose the Trump administration, the party is actively employing a multi-faceted resistance strategy both within and outside Congress. Procedurally, Democrats in the Senate use tools like filibusters and forced roll call votes to delay the passage of Republican bills, and House leaders deliver marathon speeches to slow legislative progress. Beyond the Capitol, a significant legal offensive involves hundreds of lawsuits filed against the administration, many of which have successfully blocked, reversed, or delayed various policy moves. These less visible, yet impactful, tactics aim to obstruct the administration's second-term agenda and highlight specific policies, despite the challenges of being the minority party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its second day with no immediate resolution, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats for blocking a Republican-backed seven-week stopgap funding measure. Both parties are engaged in a blame game, with Democrats insisting on healthcare demands before voting to advance any solution. The Trump administration, through OMB Director Russ Vought, has escalated threats of mass layoffs for federal workers, potentially thousands, and the cancellation of federal programs and infrastructure funding in Democratic-leaning states. Negotiations remain at a standstill, with no Senate votes scheduled due to Yom Kippur.</p>

          <p>Following a terror attack at the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester that killed two people on Yom Kippur, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged to do "everything" to protect Jewish communities and combat antisemitic hate. The attacker, identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police, and three other suspects have been arrested on terrorism charges. Starmer, who returned early from a European summit, chaired an emergency Cobra committee meeting. King Charles III and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the "horrific" incident, prompting increased police presence at synagogues nationwide.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is a central figure in the ongoing government shutdown, announcing federal funding freezes and the imminent threat of federal layoffs. President Trump highlighted Vought's leadership in Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint aiming to significantly reduce the size and scope of government. Vought has already announced the cancellation of $8 billion in climate-related projects and the withholding of $18 billion for New York City infrastructure, explicitly linking these cuts to Democratic leaders and the shutdown. His actions reflect a long-standing vision to slash federal jobs and spending.</p>

This strategic move is seen internally as a vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects and a method to retain top talent amidst intensifying competition for AI expertise, without pursuing an immediate IPO.

Worshippers and security personnel demonstrated immediate bravery, preventing the attacker from gaining entry to the synagogue.

          <p>Christa Gail Pike, 49, is scheduled for execution in Tennessee on September 30, 2026, which would mark the state's first execution of a woman in over a century. Pike was convicted in 1996 for the brutal 1995 murder of Colleen Slemmer, committed when Pike was 18. Her attorneys have consistently argued that her young age at the time, coupled with a history of mental illnesses, congenital brain damage, and childhood abuse, should preclude a death sentence, noting that such evidence was not presented at her original trial. Pike has been Tennessee's sole woman on death row for much of her three decades incarcerated.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the significant environmental and social consequences of the global "green transition," particularly focusing on the intensive mining of critical minerals like lithium and cobalt. It highlights how these extraction activities disproportionately affect Indigenous and impoverished communities worldwide, leading to issues such as water contamination, displacement, and human rights abuses, including child labor. The article argues that while essential for moving away from fossil fuels, the current approach to mineral extraction creates new challenges. It advocates for re-evaluating energy demands and promoting sustainable urban planning to reduce overall mineral consumption.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is on a six-day winning streak, with its stock reaching new record highs, contributing to the Nasdaq's positive performance despite the ongoing government shutdown. Separately, BlackRock received a strong "buy" rating and an increased price target from Bank of America, which anticipates substantial net flows in the third quarter. Analysts believe BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on growth trends in asset management, including alternative assets and the booming demand for power driven by AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, Disney is expected to announce CEO Bob Iger's successor early next year, with Josh D'Amaro as a leading candidate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are preparing an expedition to the South Pacific, claiming "very strong" evidence suggests they have located Amelia Earhart's long-lost plane in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island. A "visual anomaly" identified as the Taraia Object, visible in satellite images since 1938, will be the focus of the November investigation using sonar and magnetometers. This potential discovery could finally confirm the theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan were marooned on the island after their 1937 disappearance. Purdue, which originally funded Earhart's aircraft, hopes to transport the plane back to the university if identified.</p>

Mugabe Jr.'s lawyer denies the charges, disputing the quantity of drugs found and the circumstances of their recovery. This incident marks another legal entanglement for Mugabe Jr., who was previously arrested in 2023 for property damage and assaulting a police officer.</p>

Although a 2019 law guarantees back pay for federal employees once the government reopens, government contractors do not have the same assurance.

Despite police indicating the shooter held animosity towards the Mormon faith, the fundraiser has successfully raised over $285,000, with many donors expressing profound forgiveness and support for the grieving family.

          <p>Morocco is currently experiencing significant anti-government protests, largely led by an anonymous online collective called GenZ 212, demanding improved health services and education. These demonstrations, which began small but quickly escalated to include violence, have resulted in over 400 arrests, numerous injuries, and two deaths. Unlike previous movements, this youth-driven protest lacks a traditional leadership structure and primarily focuses on social demands rather than explicit political reform. While the government has adopted a more conciliatory stance, acknowledging the demands and promising reforms, the absence of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch from public response has drawn considerable criticism.</p>
