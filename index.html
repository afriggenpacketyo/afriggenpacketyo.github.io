          <h2>US Administration Imposes 50% Universal Tariff on Copper Imports, Triggering Market Plunge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 15:19:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has enacted a universal 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move that immediately roiled financial markets. Following the announcement, U.S. copper prices experienced a dramatic 18% plunge in after-hours trading, representing the metal's most severe single-day drop since 1989. The administration asserts the tariff is necessary to bolster domestic industries and correct trade imbalances. However, economists and industry experts express concern that the policy will lead to significant price increases for consumers on a wide array of goods, including electronics and construction materials.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting public calls for a rate cut from the Trump administration. In his statement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's political independence, stating that decisions are based on economic data and not political factors to avoid influencing elections. The committee acknowledged that tariffs have started to affect prices but noted the full economic impact remains uncertain. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed governors dissenting in favor of a quarter-point rate cut, highlighting a division within the institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 15:13:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to eliminate the de minimis trade exemption for all countries, which previously allowed imported goods valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. This global expansion of the policy follows a similar, recent ban targeting shipments from China and Hong Kong. The move is expected to significantly impact e-commerce giants like Temu and Shein, which have heavily utilized the loophole to ship products directly to American consumers without tariffs. The White House argues the change closes a major loophole that harms U.S. businesses and facilitates illicit shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in several southwestern states, including California, Texas, and Colorado, can expect an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' annual mating season begins. During September and October, tens of thousands of mature male tarantulas, typically 8 to 10 years old, emerge from their burrows in search of females. These large, hairy arachnids are generally docile and rarely bite humans unless provoked. While their bite is comparable to a bee sting, their primary defense mechanism is releasing irritating hairs from their abdomen, and they are an important part of the regional ecosystem.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold interest rates steady, with officials expressing concern about the inflationary potential of trade tariffs. Following the decision, the 10-year Treasury yield increased by 5 basis points to 4.382%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that policymakers are closely monitoring the economic effects of tariffs to ensure they do not trigger persistent inflation. The market reaction reflects investor anticipation that the central bank will maintain a cautious stance, potentially delaying future rate cuts until the impact of trade policies becomes clearer.

          <h2>Gaza Health Ministry Reports Seven Additional Deaths from Malnutrition</h2>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that seven more people, including children, have died from malnutrition, bringing the total number of such deaths to 154 since the conflict began. This report comes as a UN-backed food security initiative warns that a worst-case famine scenario is currently unfolding in the territory. Despite the dire situation, aid delivery remains severely restricted, with only a fraction of the estimated 600 daily trucks needed to address the crisis successfully entering and distributing supplies. Israel maintains it is not restricting aid, a claim disputed by international agencies and allies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing billions of dollars in costs from tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and foreign parts, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows that new vehicle price increases have remained below the historical average, as companies fear that higher prices would deter already-stretched buyers. Automakers like General Motors and Volkswagen have reported tariff-related costs exceeding a billion dollars but are temporarily absorbing the financial hit. However, executives indicate this strategy is not sustainable, and consumers may see higher prices and reduced financing deals on 2026 models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent immigration enforcement sweeps in California are having a measurable negative effect on the state's economy, according to new research. An analysis of census data revealed a significant 3.1% decrease in people reporting to work in the private sector when the raids began, a downturn comparable only to the COVID-19 lockdown. Economists warn that the disruption to the immigrant workforce, which is crucial to sectors like agriculture and construction, could lead to labor shortages, project delays, and higher food prices.

          <p>Workers at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a former nuclear bomb production facility, discovered a wasp nest with radiation levels 10 times higher than federal regulations permit. The nest was found on a post near tanks holding liquid nuclear waste, though officials stated there is no evidence of a leak from the tanks. The contamination is believed to be from residual radioactivity at the legacy site. The nest was safely removed and disposed of as radioactive waste, and authorities have assured the public there is no danger, as the contamination is contained well within the facility's boundaries.</p>

          <p>As Americans grapple with record-high credit card debt, an informational article outlines the criteria for qualifying for debt forgiveness programs, which can potentially reduce balances by 30-50%. The most likely candidates are those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, which they can document for creditors. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt, typically over $10,000, are also in a stronger negotiating position. Additionally, those who have already fallen behind on payments may have more leverage, as creditors prefer a partial settlement to a total loss from bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has discovered extensive communities of larger life forms, such as tubeworms and mollusks, thriving at depths over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's deep-sea trenches. These extreme environments, characterized by immense pressure and a lack of sunlight, were previously thought to primarily support microbial life. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from ancient carbon deposits on the seafloor. The findings challenge existing models of life at extreme depths and suggest such ecosystems may be more common than anticipated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's choice to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged directly impacts the borrowing costs for American consumers. Because many consumer loans have variable rates, the decision means that rates for credit cards, auto loans, and home equity lines of credit will remain at or near their current elevated levels for the time being. While this is unfavorable for borrowers, it benefits savers, as high-yield savings accounts continue to offer returns above the rate of inflation. The Fed's cautious stance is largely attributed to uncertainty surrounding the inflationary effects of recent trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
