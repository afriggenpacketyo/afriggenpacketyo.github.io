          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a figure exceeding its own current valuation. The move is reportedly backed by several investors and comes after the Department of Justice recommended Google divest Chrome following an antitrust ruling that found the company held an illegal search monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, sees the acquisition as a strategic move to level the playing field for search competitors. This follows other ambitious proposals from the startup, including a merger with TikTok.</p>

          <p>A new report from JLL suggests that the rapid advancement of quantum computing is set to create a significant new demand for specialized commercial real estate, similar to the data center boom driven by AI. As quantum technology becomes commercially viable, it requires unique facilities with features like electromagnetic shielding, distinct from traditional data centers. The industry is projected to attract billions in investment by 2030, with emerging hubs located near research centers in places like Chicago, Boston, and Southern California. This trend presents a new, long-term opportunity for real estate development and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to sign the Sonya Massey Act, a new law mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct in previous law enforcement roles. Under the new law, agencies cannot make a final hiring offer without inspecting a candidate's complete prior employment records, including performance and disciplinary history. This reform aims to prevent officers with problematic pasts from being hired by different departments within the state.</p>

The Trump administration contends the action was a necessary response to attacks on federal officers.

          <p>President Trump's move to federalize Washington D.C.'s police force highlights the city's unique and limited self-governance under the 1973 Home Rule Act. Historically, D.C. was governed for a century by presidentially appointed commissioners until the civil rights-era push for home rule. Even after 1974, a federally appointed Control Board took over the city's finances in the 1990s due to a fiscal crisis, stripping power from the elected mayor and council. This history provides context for the president's current authority, though federalizing the police force for a declared crime emergency is an unprecedented application of that power.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is moving to sanction a California-based lawyer who attempted to block his client's deportation, signaling an escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The government alleges that attorney Joshua Schroeder made "meritless contentions" and misrepresentations in his court filings on behalf of a Hmong immigrant. This action follows a presidential memorandum directing the attorney general to target lawyers pursuing what the administration deems frivolous lawsuits. Advocates fear this is a tactic to intimidate immigration lawyers and weaponize the justice system against opponents of the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Israel has launched an intense bombardment of Gaza City as its forces prepare for a ground occupation, according to the territory's civil defense agency. The air and drone strikes have caused massive destruction, trapping residents. Concurrently, the UK, EU, and other allies issued a joint statement demanding Israel take immediate steps to allow aid into Gaza, warning that "famine is unfolding in front of our eyes." Israel's war cabinet has voted to occupy the city to dismantle what it calls the two remaining Hamas strongholds there, a move condemned by the UN Security Council.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the overall U.S. inflation rate held steady at 2.7% in July, a closer look at the data reveals potential effects of the Trump administration's economic policies. Economists note that core goods inflation, for items like apparel and furniture, is rising at its fastest pace in two years, suggesting that tariffs are being passed on to consumers. Additionally, rising prices in personal care services may indicate that restrictive immigration policies are limiting labor supply and driving up wages in those sectors. These underlying trends suggest that policy-driven inflation could become more pronounced in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling more than 103,000 of its F-150 pickup trucks from model years 2023 to 2025 due to a potentially dangerous rear axle hub bolt issue. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the bolt can fatigue and break, which could lead to a loss of driving power or cause the vehicle to roll away when parked. This defect increases the risk of a crash. Ford will notify owners and dealers will replace the rear axle shaft assemblies free of charge to resolve the problem.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has the authority under the D.C. Home Rule Act to temporarily federalize the city's police force during a self-declared emergency, that power has a significant legal limit. The statute explicitly states that such control cannot extend beyond 30 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution to authorize an extension. Legal experts note that while the president has broad discretion to determine if an emergency exists, the 30-day cap is a firm restriction. Any attempt by the president to unilaterally extend his control would likely face a strong legal challenge.</p>

She suggests that laughter, inspired by the likes of Monty Python, can be a fearless act that agitates authoritarian figures who rule by fear. The author posits that while direct action like protesting and organizing is crucial, small acts of personal happiness and kindness are also vital for maintaining hope and humanity.

Musk claimed on his platform, X, that Apple has made it "impossible" for other apps to compete with ChatGPT in its App Store. The row escalated when Altman responded by referencing a report that Musk had amplified his own posts on X, prompting Musk to call him a "liar." This public spat is the latest chapter in the rivalry between the two tech billionaires, which stems from Musk's belief that OpenAI has abandoned its original non-profit mission.</p>

          <p>For investors seeking stability, a high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) can be an attractive option, and a $100,000 deposit can earn significant interest at current rates. Depending on the term length, which can range from three months to five years, savers could earn anywhere from approximately $1,000 to over $22,000. Because CD rates are fixed, they offer predictable returns without the volatility of the stock market. This makes them a potentially valuable tool for securing principal while generating guaranteed interest, though savers should consider the trade-off of locking up their funds.

The move comes in response to the growing "cagongjok" trend, where people set up elaborate workspaces in cafes for hours, limiting seating for other patrons. While laptops and tablets are still welcome, the company aims to balance being a remote work-friendly space with ensuring a pleasant experience for all customers. The policy has been met with approval on Korean social media, where many have expressed frustration with the practice.</p>
