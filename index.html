          <p>Deadly flash floods and landslides have struck Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, claiming the lives of 11 individuals, including four children and three women. The severe weather, which also injured six people, caused significant damage, with reports of families being swept away and 56 homes destroyed in the Swat Valley. Meteorological officials have issued warnings for continued heavy rainfall and potential flooding until Tuesday, highlighting the nation's extreme vulnerability to climate change. A former climate change minister criticized the government's lack of preparedness, stating the country continues to "sleepwalk" through a crisis of escalating intensity.</p>

          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the future of nuclear energy, exposing conflicting priorities between the Economy and Environment ministries. The dispute was highlighted when the Economy Minister attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, despite Germany's official phase-out of nuclear power in 2023. This move angered the Environment Minister, who is responsible for nuclear safety and committed to the country's transition to renewable energy sources. The disagreement is further complicated by plans for 20 new gas-fired power plants, which climate experts warn could jeopardize Germany's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2045.</p>

          <p>A top economist from China International Capital Corporation argues that China possesses a significant advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins due to its established third-party payment systems. In a research note, Peng Wensheng stated that platforms like WeChat and Alipay function similarly to stablecoins, acting as extensions of legal tender with a 1:1 peg to fiat currency. He highlighted that these systems are supported by a mature regulatory framework and strict safeguards, with customer funds backed by central bank money. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain proactive in the evolving landscape of digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed international trade restrictions on all eel species under the Washington Convention, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan. If the proposal is adopted, it would take effect in June 2027 and mandate that exports of Japanese eel and other species require permits proving legal capture. The measure is aimed at protecting endangered eel populations, which have been under significant pressure. The move highlights a growing international conflict between conservation efforts and commercial fishing interests, particularly for nations like Japan where eel is a culinary staple.</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have developed a joint plan to allow certain international graduate students to study in Canada if they are barred from the United States. This arrangement for Harvard's Kennedy School of Government students to attend Toronto's Munk School comes in response to potential U.S. visa restrictions and a legal battle with the Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration has moved to cut federal funding and scrutinize Harvard's international student program amid campus protests. The contingency plan aims to provide stability for students and ensure they can continue their education despite the uncertain U.S. policy environment.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to scrap 201 organizations within the National Health Service (NHS) in England as part of a new 10-year health strategy. Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the move aims to simplify a complex system and focus resources on frontline care, creating "more doers and fewer checkers." The strategy also includes a trial scheme linking hospital funding to patient satisfaction ratings, a move that has drawn both cautious support and concern from healthcare leaders.</p>

The situation has left villagers feeling powerless and has highlighted the immense influence of concentrated, anonymous wealth in rural England.

Holland lamented the loss of the shared experience where players and their families could celebrate together in the arena, arguing the event should be about the young athletes.

The administration has suggested the pause might be extended, but President Trump has also expressed a desire to impose a 25% tariff broadly.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, stated schools must notify parents in advance when these books are used.

          <p>This article presents an analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, suggesting its long-term objective has been to prevent any regional power from achieving military or technological parity with Israel. Citing an anecdotal exchange with a U.S. senator, the author posits that the goal was not necessarily regime change in countries like Saddam Hussein's Iraq, but rather their reduction to a "pre-industrial society." This neoconservative-influenced agenda, the article argues, became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. The piece frames the ongoing cycle of conflict in the region as a direct consequence of this strategic pursuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's solar manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant downturn, grappling with a domestic supply glut and a fierce price war that has caused prices to plummet by up to 80% since 2023. The situation is exacerbated by U.S. tariffs that are blocking access to key export markets, creating a challenging environment for companies once hailed as new economic drivers. Industry leaders report that losses in the photovoltaic manufacturing value chain reached $40 billion in 2024, leading to a weary and uncertain mood at a major industry conference. The financial strain is reflected in the stock prices of major producers, which have fallen sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL coach Jim Harbaugh, now with the Los Angeles Chargers, has been added to a class-action lawsuit against the University of Michigan and a former assistant coach, Matt Weiss. The lawsuit alleges that Weiss, while working under Harbaugh at Michigan, hacked into the computer accounts of over 2,000 college athletes to find private photos. Attorneys for the plaintiffs claim Harbaugh and other university officials knew Weiss was viewing private information but allowed him to continue coaching in a playoff game in December 2022. Weiss, who was fired in January 2023, faces separate criminal charges to which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old Gresham man, Jesus Ascenio-Molina, has been sentenced to more than six years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery and assault.

The attack occurred after the victim refused to hand over the keys to his 2011 Porsche Panamera, which Ascenio-Molina had been admiring. The elderly victim survived the attack and expressed relief at the sentencing, while Ascenio-Molina apologized in court, stating he "wasnâ€™t thinking straight" at the time of the violent crime.</p>

Sources close to the player have also dismissed suggestions that Acheampong is frustrated at the club, noting he signed a new five-year contract last year.

Spain equalized just before halftime and scored two more goals in the second half to secure the victory.

Experts suggest this decision reflects pressing priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and concerns that U.S. attention is being diverted by conflicts in the Middle East. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly canceled his trip at the last minute after it became clear a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was unlikely. The absences highlight a potential shift in focus for these key U.S. allies, as regional security calculations take precedence over participation in the alliance's gathering.</p>

The ongoing tit-for-tat tariff war has hit Canada's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., slowing growth and reducing business confidence. Despite ongoing talks, President Trump recently terminated discussions over Canada's digital services tax, leaving businesses desperate for a stable set of trade rules. (not investment advice)</p>

While the White House has declared the strikes a success that set back Iran's program by years, some Democrats who received classified briefings have cast doubt on these claims.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year, faster than sea levels are rising. Using satellite radar data, researchers identified hotspots where the ground is subsiding, potentially degrading the effectiveness of the $15 billion system designed to block storm surges. The sinking is most pronounced around industrial sites and newer developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a "wake-up call" for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city from increasing flood risk.</p>

Long-standing CDC experts attempted to counter these claims with evidence-based data, but the new committee members, including noted COVID contrarians, appeared to prioritize personal intuition and disproven theories.

In a 6-3 decision related to President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, the court ruled that such sweeping orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. While the ruling narrows the scope of the injunctions against the birthright citizenship policy, it did not address the constitutionality of the order itself. The decision is a significant victory for the executive branch, potentially allowing it to proceed with numerous policies previously halted by single-judge orders.</p>

Based on experiences in other states that implemented similar rules, the governor's office estimates millions would lose coverage due to the complex verification process.

The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who regularly ate foods like rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed were less likely to report symptoms of depression. Researchers controlled for other potential influencing factors and suggested that specific nutrients in the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being.
