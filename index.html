          <h2>Nvidia CEO Addresses US Concerns Over Chip Use by Chinese Military</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:07:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly dismissed U.S. concerns regarding the potential use of his company's advanced artificial intelligence chips by the Chinese military, ahead of an upcoming trip to China. Huang contended that China cannot reliably depend on U.S.-made technology due to the risk of limitations, and already possesses ample computing capacity, making Nvidia's chips unnecessary for their military development. He reiterated his view that current export controls are counterproductive to U.S. tech leadership, as they restrict engagement with a global pool of AI developers, with half located in China. The article highlights that Washington's latest restrictions are expected to cause billions in losses for Nvidia, forcing the company to navigate a complex geopolitical tightrope to balance national security interests with maintaining global market access.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Avoids Recession Amid Manufacturing Growth, Forecasts Uneven Recovery</h2>

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully averting a technical recession after a Q1 contraction, and surpassed expectations with a 4.3% year-over-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by the manufacturing sector, which benefited from a temporary pause in "reciprocal tariffs" and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, alongside a construction boom. Despite these positive GDP figures, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant global economic uncertainty and downside risks for the latter half of 2025, particularly due to a lack of clarity on U.S. tariff policies. Analysts note the volatile trade environment and the need for potential fiscal stimulus, with some expecting a slowdown in the second half, while others are more optimistic about overall 2025 growth.

          <h2>Archaeologists Discover Multistory Structures in Ancient Egyptian City of Imet</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 04:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British archaeologists, collaborating with experts from the University of Sadat City, have unearthed multistory buildings and other significant structures within the ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Imet, located in the Nile Delta. Employing remote sensing and satellite imagery, the team discovered substantial tower houses and granaries, dating to the Ptolemaic Period (332 B.C. - 30 B.C.), which indicate a thriving and densely populated urban center with complex infrastructure. The excavation also revealed a ceremonial road connected to the cult of Wadjet, animal enclosures, and various artifacts, providing fresh insights into the city's urban planning, religious landscapes, and economic life.

The announcement follows a recent political divorce from key allies who had previously helped secure votes, with these former allies and other opposition figures now announcing their own candidacies.

          <p>London Southend Airport has been closed indefinitely following a plane crash on Sunday afternoon, which witnesses vividly described as a "huge fireball." Essex Police responded to reports of a 12-meter plane on fire, and Dutch company Zeusch Aviation confirmed its SUZ1 flight was involved, with its thoughts extended to those affected. The aircraft, identified as a Beech B200 Super King Air, had flown from Athens to Pula before its planned return to Lelystad Airport. Witnesses observed the plane banking heavily before inverting and impacting the ground, leading to speculation of a left engine power loss, an issue noted in similar past crashes. Authorities are collaborating with the Air Accident Investigation Branch, and no casualties have been confirmed.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Governor, Andrew Bailey, has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market demonstrates significant signs of slowing down, reinforcing his belief that the path for rates is "downward." With the next review set for August 7th, many economists anticipate a cut from the current 4.25%, which directly impacts mortgages, credit cards, and savings rates for millions. Bailey explained that the UK economy's growth below its potential is creating "slack," aiding inflation reduction, and observed consistent signs of businesses adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. This article highlights that the central bank is closely monitoring economic indicators, including recent dips in job vacancies and a jump in available workers, for further monetary policy adjustments.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing expectations, driven by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary reprieve from U.S. tariffs that eased the decline in goods sent to America.

The article highlights a significant surge in rare earth shipments by 60% to a record high, alongside increases in steel, integrated circuits, cars, and ships exports. While the first half of the year showed upbeat trade data, economists caution that export momentum could falter due to ongoing U.S. tariff uncertainty, necessitating potential fiscal stimulus.

This new initiative, often referred to as "neijuan" or involution, presents distinct challenges compared to the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" that focused on eliminating industrial overcapacity, given China's altered economic landscape. Analysts indicate that factors such as a greater presence of private firms, weaker overall economic growth, and limited fiscal space will complicate Beijing's efforts to effectively curb this phenomenon.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has affirmed the safety of fuel control switches in Boeing aircraft, despite their reported involvement in a fatal Air India crash that killed 260 people in June. This statement comes after a preliminary investigation report highlighted that the fuel to the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner engines was cut off shortly after takeoff, and referenced a 2018 FAA advisory suggesting non-mandatory inspections of these switches. The FAA, in an internal note, stated that it does not consider the issue an "unsafe condition" warranting an Airworthiness Directive on any Boeing model. This article clarifies the FAA's stance, noting that while the airline had not performed the suggested inspections, the authority maintains the switches are safe.</p>

          <p>Hungary's 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey, a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the country's oldest learning centers, is undertaking a massive effort to save 100,000 centuries-old books from a pervasive drugstore beetle infestation. Restoration workers are meticulously removing and disinfecting the volumes by placing them in hermetically sealed, oxygen-free environments for six weeks to eradicate the pests, which are attracted to the books' gelatin and starch-based adhesives. This advanced infestation, the most severe ever encountered by the abbey, was detected during routine cleaning and is believed to be exacerbated by rising temperatures due to climate change. This article underscores the urgent conservation efforts to protect invaluable historical and cultural treasures from irreversible damage.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) brands are rapidly gaining significant market share in Norway, a leading EV market, presenting substantial competition to established Western automakers like Tesla. This explosive growth, which sees Chinese brands capturing approximately 10% of the market, is driven by their competitive pricing and advanced technology, and is notably occurring in Norway due to its policy of not imposing tariffs on Chinese EV imports. The article highlights Norway as "Europe's laboratory for EVs," serving as an accessible entry point for new brands given its lack of a domestic auto industry to protect. This trend underscores a broader challenge for European manufacturers to accelerate the production of more affordable EV models to compete effectively.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation has exposed dubious sales tactics at two prominent UK estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks, raising significant concerns about consumer fairness and industry practices. Connells was found to prioritize prospective buyers who committed to using their in-house mortgage and conveyancing services, potentially sidelining other offers to maximize company profit, a practice bordering on "conditional selling" which is forbidden. Separately, Purplebricks was accused of overvaluing properties to attract sellers, then incentivizing staff to push for price reductions once a client was secured. This article highlights systemic issues within the industry, with consumer experts calling for urgent investigations and updated regulations to better protect homeowners and buyers from such practices.</p>

The investigation by a social worker, Henrietta Coker, exposed a network of "baby factories" in West Africa, where children are trafficked, sometimes after young girls are sexually assaulted and forced to give birth. The court ordered Eleanor to be placed for adoption, highlighting the heinous nature of such crimes and the challenges in combating child trafficking.</p>
