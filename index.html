          <p>Top-seeded tennis player Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals after a challenging three-set victory over Germany's Laura Siegemund. Sabalenka, the clear favorite, lost the first set and had to fight back from being a break down twice in the final set to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. The 37-year-old Siegemund, a doubles specialist, used a varied playstyle that nearly caused a major upset in the tournament. Sabalenka will now face either Amanda Anisimova or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a spot in her first Wimbledon singles final.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reportedly sacked "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace following an inquiry into misconduct allegations, with 50 more individuals now coming forward with new claims. The allegations, which Wallace denies, include accusations of groping and other inappropriate sexual behavior spanning two decades. In a statement, Wallace acknowledged that his humor was sometimes inappropriate but denied the most serious claims, accusing BBC News of reporting "uncorroborated tittle tattle." The new claims raise further questions about workplace culture and safeguarding practices at the BBC and other production companies he worked for.</p>

          <p>The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that the annual cost of the state pension "triple lock" policy will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times the original estimate. The policy ensures the state pension increases annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report highlighted the UK's vulnerable public finances, noting that recent government reversals on spending cuts have contributed to rising debt. This long-term spending pressure, combined with an aging population, places the UK's finances on an "unsustainable" path, according to the OBR chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Canada's decision to retreat on its digital services tax demonstrates a capitulation to bullying tactics from the Trump administration. The author, Joseph E.

In contrast, China was viewed as the top threat in only three countries: the U.S., Australia, and Japan.

The proposed bill would allow the government, with parliamentary approval, to draft citizens if there are not enough volunteers to meet defense needs. This move is a response to the altered security landscape in Europe and is seen as a compromise between calls for a full return to compulsory service and opposition to the draft. The plan also aims to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay, intending to bolster Germany's armed forces to meet new NATO guidelines.</p>

The false claims, amplified by some political figures, linked the flooding to weather modification activities conducted by a startup two days prior. Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists have clarified that cloud seeding can only slightly enhance rainfall in existing clouds and is physically incapable of creating a massive storm system like the one that hit Texas. Experts also noted that any particles from the seeding operation would have dispersed far from the area long before the catastrophic rainfall occurred.</p>

          <p>Three men have been found guilty of an aggravated arson attack on a London warehouse that was shipping aid to Ukraine, an act they carried out on behalf of the Russian Wagner Group. The attack, which caused around £1 million in damage, was orchestrated by two other men who had already pleaded guilty. The plot was part of a larger series of planned "missions" for Wagner, which also included targeting a Russian dissident in London. The case is a stark example of a foreign state-linked entity using British citizens as proxies to conduct serious criminal and hostile activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire has spread to the edge of Marseille, France's second-largest city, prompting the closure of the local airport and evacuation advisories for some residents. The fire, which broke out north of the city, was fanned by strong winds and has burned through a significant area of land. Authorities have deployed hundreds of firefighters, helicopters, and fire engines to combat the blaze. This event comes as other parts of Europe, including Spain and Greece, are also battling wildfires amid dry conditions, just weeks after a deadly early summer heatwave affected the continent.</p>

          <p>Ten people are facing federal attempted murder charges for allegedly carrying out a planned ambush on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a Texas detention center. Prosecutors claim the attackers used fireworks to lure agents outside the facility before opening fire, shooting a local police officer in the neck and firing 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed corrections officers. The assailants were apprehended nearby with tactical gear and weapons. U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson described the incident not as a protest but as an "egregious attack" with the intent to kill law enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally serving a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms to her family members in 2023. Prosecutors successfully argued that Patterson knowingly used the poisonous fungi in a home-cooked meal, leading to the deaths of three people. Patterson had denied the charges, offering conflicting stories about where she obtained the mushrooms. The case has drawn international attention and highlighted the extreme danger of death cap mushrooms, whose toxins are not destroyed by cooking and cause catastrophic liver failure.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's major election defeat, former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to investment bank Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. Sunak, who worked for the bank in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical matters. His pay will be donated to his charity. The appointment was delayed by a governmental watchdog for one year after he left office to mitigate risks of unfair influence. For the next year, his role is restricted from advising on topics that overlap with his responsibilities as Prime Minister.</p>

The deliveries included 42 of its 737 MAX jets and marked the resumption of shipments to Chinese customers for the first time since a trade dispute ended. The increase in deliveries is a crucial step for the company as it works to recover from production setbacks and stabilize its finances.

          <p>India's suspension of the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty has created deep uncertainty for Pakistan, a nation heavily reliant on the Indus river system for its agriculture and water supply. India halted its adherence to the treaty following a militant attack it blamed on Pakistan, a charge Pakistan denies. While India has not yet taken action to divert water, its move to suspend the treaty is seen by Pakistan as "weaponizing water" and a potential act of war. The situation exacerbates Pakistan's existing water scarcity issues, which are already compounded by climate change and internal disputes over water distribution.</p>

          <p>A police firearms officer involved in a violent altercation at Manchester Airport testified that his actions were professional and in accordance with his training. The officer, PC Zachary Marsden, was allegedly assaulted by two brothers, Mohammed and Muhammad Amaaz, after he and his colleagues attempted to arrest one of them for allegedly headbutting another person. The defense attorney argued that the officers used disproportionate and unnecessary force, rendering the arrest unlawful and forcing the brothers to act in self-defense.

This confirmation comes despite warnings from the farm sector that such actions would severely disrupt the nation's food supply. Rollins suggested that the labor gap could be filled by automation and by encouraging able-bodied adults currently on Medicaid to join the workforce. The administration also plans to curb farmland purchases by "foreign adversaries" like China and may seek to reclaim land already owned by such entities.</p>

The historic loan is part of a cultural exchange with France, which will see treasures like the Sutton Hoo artifacts travel to Normandy.

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively nullifies the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment, which President Trump has long opposed. The filing was part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious broadcasters and two Texas churches who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. The new interpretation allows a house of worship to speak to its congregation on electoral politics from a faith perspective without it being considered prohibited campaign intervention.</p>

It will examine his history, including previous attacks, possession of weapons, and referrals to the counter-extremism Prevent program, to identify any missed opportunities to intervene.
