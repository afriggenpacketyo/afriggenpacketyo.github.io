          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is marked by political tensions, particularly due to Israel's participation.

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to curb soaring rice prices. This measure follows a shortfall in rice distribution caused by high temperatures in the summer of 2023 and increased consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists. The government is considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage participation in auctions. Despite an increase in the 2024 rice harvest, wholesalers and farmers are suspected of hoarding rice in anticipation of further price hikes.</p>

          <p>Three Māori MPs in New Zealand face suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a legislative session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers, recommending suspensions for Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke and Te Pāti Māori co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. The Māori Party criticized the recommendations as a "warning shot to all of us to fall in line," while Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters condemned the trio's actions.

          <p>An intergovernmental grouping of 21 economies, including the U.S. and China, has cautioned that their collective growth faces a significant slowdown due to tariff tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% the previous year. Director Carlos Kuriyama emphasized that the current trade environment is not conducive to investment and trade, leading to delayed investments and product launches.

          <p>Alabama lawmakers approved legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans framed the bill as support for law enforcement, while Democrats criticized it as a "green light to kill Black folks." The bill states that an officer is justified in using physical force as long as it is not constitutionally excessive or recklessly outside discretionary authority. Civil rights attorneys expressed concern that the bill could embolden misconduct, while supporters argued it would not provide blanket immunity to law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, driven by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes it will be shielded from potential U.S. tariffs. Most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders, as Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system. The IMF noted that direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, but heightened trade tensions and trade policy uncertainty pose risks. The fund singled out Novo Nordisk's increased demand for Wegovy and Ozempic as a key driver of growth.</p>
