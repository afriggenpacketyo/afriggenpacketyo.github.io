          <p>Jeremy Crawshaw, a 23-year-old Australian punter from Emu Plains, has been drafted by the Denver Broncos, making him the first punter selected in the NFL draft this year. After five seasons at the University of Florida, where he set records for punt average, Crawshaw will compete with veteran P Matt Haack for the starting job. His rugby background and versatility in punt styles are expected to make him a valuable asset, particularly in outdoor stadiums. Crawshaw joins other Australian punters already in the NFL, with scouts predicting a long and successful career for him.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) refuted claims from the Venezuelan government that the Trump administration kidnapped children of Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members. DHS stated that they intervened because the child's parents are high-ranking members of the violent gang involved in homicides, sexual assault, and drug trafficking. The child was removed from the deportation flight for safety and placed in foster care under the Office of Refugee Resettlement. DHS emphasized their commitment to protecting children from abuse and exploitation, thanking Trump for removing the gang members from the country.</p>

Voters are weighing which party can best handle the challenges posed by potential US tariffs and annexation talks. The Liberals, once trailing significantly, have surged due to Carney's image as a steady leader capable of navigating economic uncertainty.

          <p>Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican during Pope Francis' funeral, engaging in a discussion about the ongoing conflict. Following the meeting, Trump expressed a stronger stance against Putin's actions in Ukraine. The funeral, attended by leaders from over 150 countries, included a homily that seemed to nod at past tensions between Trump and the late Pope. Upon returning to the U.S., Trump faced new polling data indicating historically low popularity ratings as he nears his 100th day in office.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, in coordination with state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 immigrants in Florida this week. The operation targeted undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders, with over 275 migrants taken into custody. This effort marks the latest attempt by the Trump administration to accelerate deportations, working with state law enforcement through a 287(g) agreement. The arrests have been met with mixed reactions as the administration continues to prioritize immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, survivors and their families gathered to commemorate the atrocities of the Nazi concentration camp. British and Canadian troops entered the camp in April 1945, discovering thousands of unburied corpses and emaciated survivors. Belsen became notorious due to the chilling accounts of journalists and soldiers, as well as the preserved evidence of Nazi cruelty. The camp endured approximately 500 deaths a day in its final weeks, with the vast majority of victims being Jews.</p>
