          <p>Tesla's stock has erased its losses for the year, rising 3.6% on Monday to close above its 2024 starting price. This marks an impressive 85% surge from its low point in early April, providing a significant boost to the electric vehicle maker after a difficult first quarter. The rally was partly fueled by a new filing revealing that CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares, a move interpreted by investors as a strong signal of confidence in the company's future despite ongoing sales slumps and increased competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is anticipated to lower its benchmark interest rate, this article explains the nuanced impact on mortgage costs. The Fed's rate directly affects short-term loans between banks, while fixed-rate mortgages are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury note's performance. Experts note that financial markets have largely priced in the expected cut, meaning homeowners should not anticipate an immediate, significant drop in mortgage rates, which have already slightly decreased in recent weeks. Future statements from the Fed chair may have a greater impact on long-term rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former MMA champion Conor McGregor has officially withdrawn his candidacy for the Irish presidential election. In his announcement, McGregor claimed the country's political rules are structured to prevent a truly democratic process, favoring only establishment-approved candidates. His short-lived campaign had drawn attention due to his anti-immigration stance and support from far-right figures. McGregor's political ambitions have been shadowed by personal controversies, including a recent loss in a civil court case where he was found liable for sexual assault.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to access their home's equity, this article outlines several key borrowing strategies. It details options such as a home equity loan, which offers predictable fixed payments, and a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which provides flexible access to funds similar to a credit card. A cash-out refinance could secure a lower interest rate but involves replacing the entire mortgage. The article also covers reverse mortgages as a specialized tool for seniors aged 62 and older, weighing the benefits and risks of each method. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks advanced on Monday, with the S&P 500 approaching another record high ahead of a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting where an interest rate cut is widely expected. Technology stocks helped lead the gains, with Alphabet's market value surpassing $3 trillion and Tesla's shares rising after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a $1 billion stock purchase. Investors are closely watching for the Fed's decision and Chair Jerome Powell's subsequent comments, as the market has already priced in a rate cut, creating potential for disappointment if future cuts are not as aggressive as hoped.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to the beheading of a Dallas motel manager by blaming the previous administration's immigration policies for allowing the suspect, a Cuban national, to remain in the U.S. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, was under a final deportation order but had been released from detention because Cuba refused to accept his return due to his criminal record. The case has intensified the political debate over immigration enforcement, with the Trump administration highlighting its new policy of deporting individuals to third-party countries willing to accept them.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting an "end-run" around U.S. law by deporting migrants to third countries like Ghana, from which they risk being sent back to nations where they fear persecution or torture. The case involves African deportees who hold legal protections preventing their removal to their home countries. The judge expressed frustration that the U.S. government appeared to be bypassing its legal obligations and ordered it to explain what steps were being taken to ensure the migrants' safety.</p>

          <p>Amid its ongoing war in Gaza, Israel is confronting deepening international isolation, raising questions of whether it is nearing a "South Africa moment." Several European countries, including Spain and Belgium, have imposed sanctions, while Norway's sovereign wealth fund is divesting from Israeli companies. The article also notes growing calls for cultural and sporting boycotts, further straining Israel's international standing. While the U.S. remains a steadfast ally, some former Israeli diplomats express grave concern over the country's pariah status.</p>

          <h2>President Trump Proposes Shifting Corporate Earnings Reports from Quarterly to Semiannual</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:34:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that public companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change he argues would save money and promote long-term strategic thinking over short-term profit chasing. The idea has support from some corporate executives who dislike the pressure of frequent reporting. However, many financial experts and investor advocates oppose the proposal, warning that less frequent disclosure would reduce transparency, potentially increasing market volatility and creating opportunities for accounting fraud. Any change would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are reporting confusion and frustration after their loans were transferred to new servicing companies with little or no advance notice. One borrower's account was moved from Nelnet to a new servicer, Central Research Inc. (CRI), and was unexpectedly placed into administrative forbearance. Experts advise that while such transfers can be disruptive, borrowers should wait until their new account is fully operational before making payments to avoid them getting lost. They also recommend checking credit reports afterward to ensure no payments were incorrectly marked as late.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis, renewable energy sources are the most cost-competitive options for producing electricity, even without accounting for government subsidies. The report identifies onshore wind and utility-scale solar as the cheapest forms of energy on a per-megawatt-hour basis, primarily due to their low operational costs once built, despite high initial capital investment. In contrast, fossil fuels like coal and natural gas are more expensive to generate. The article also notes that factors like tax incentives and tariffs can further influence these costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a guide on various ways to access money from an annuity, a financial product typically designed for long-term, guaranteed retirement income. The most straightforward method is waiting for scheduled payments to begin, but other options exist for earlier access. These include making partial withdrawals, which are often penalty-free up to 10% of the value annually, taking a loan against the contract, or fully surrendering the annuity for its cash value, though this usually incurs significant fees. Special riders for hardships may also permit penalty-free access. (not investment advice)</p>
