            <p>Lucy Edwards, a blind content creator with Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP), is undergoing IVF with pre-implantation genetic testing to screen out the gene that caused her blindness. IP runs through the female line and can be catastrophic in male pregnancies, leading to miscarriages or severe brain damage. Lucy acknowledges the ethical considerations of editing out a part of herself but wants to minimize the likelihood of miscarriage and give her child the healthiest start possible. She has received mostly positive feedback from her fans, although some negative comments have questioned her decision to become a mother.</p>

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Nigeria's Benue state has risen to 56, with Governor Hyacinth Alia blaming suspected herdsmen for the violence. The attacks, which targeted villages in the Ukum and Logo local government areas, are the latest in a series of intercommunal clashes in Nigeria's Middle Belt, driven by disputes over land use between nomadic herders and settled farmers. Climate change-worsened drought and desertification exacerbate the issue, pushing herders south in search of grazing lands. Amnesty International has criticized the government for failing to stem the violence.</p>

A BBC documentary, Growing Up Gypsy, highlights the experiences of young Romany women navigating everyday life and the pressures they face in professional and public spaces. Prejudice against the GRT community remains widespread, with a 2021 poll suggesting that many people would be uncomfortable employing a Gypsy or traveler.

            <p>Roki Sasaki showed progress in six innings, allowing two runs, but the Dodgers lost to the Rangers on a walk-off home run. The bullpen faltered in the ninth inning, overshadowing Sasaki's positive performance. Blake Treinen's absence due to injury was felt in the save situation. Despite the loss, Sasaki's development and the Dodgers' offensive efforts were encouraging signs.</p>

China is also sensitive to not come across as backing down, but this gives them a means of doing so.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv would adhere to the truce, but accused Moscow of breaking it. Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov. The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was "mutually respected" by Ukraine. The Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: "Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter."</p>
