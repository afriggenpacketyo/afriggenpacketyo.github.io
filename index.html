          <p>China is actively pursuing the creation of a new economic bloc with countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, aiming to counter increasing protectionist measures from the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the potential for deeper mutual trust and solidarity amid escalating geopolitical conflicts at the Asean-China-GCC Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur. The three parties also signed a joint statement, expressing commitment to enhanced cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure, and finance, with the goal of unlocking substantial expansion opportunities.

          <p>In Gila County, Arizona, a region that heavily supported President Trump, residents hold complex views on Medicaid, a vital healthcare program. Despite conservative leanings and concerns about government waste, many residents rely on Medicaid for essential healthcare services. Proposed Republican cuts to Medicaid have ignited debate, especially among those dependent on the program due to low incomes or disabilities. The potential loss of coverage raises significant concerns, highlighting the program's critical role in rural communities where healthcare access is often limited. The debate underscores the tension between conservative values and the practical need for government support in healthcare.</p>

          <p>Economic uncertainty is causing a slump in home sales and construction, with last month being the slowest April for existing home sales in 16 years. Builder confidence has also dropped, reflecting concerns about housing costs and the impact of tariffs. High home prices and rising mortgage interest rates are making it difficult for many Americans to afford homes, while the tariff debate creates uncertainty for builders. The situation is further complicated by lumber costs, as the cost of framing lumber is up approximately 16% over a year ago, leading to builders finding it difficult to price homes.</p>

          <p>Pride Month is approaching, a period dedicated to honoring the history, impact, and resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. The word "pride" has transformed from denoting excessive self-esteem to symbolizing LGBTQ+ empowerment and strength. Originating from the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins, pride initially represented unchecked self-importance. However, influenced by the civil rights movement and pivotal events like the Stonewall Uprising, the LGBTQ+ community embraced "pride" to assert their worth and challenge negative stereotypes, with the rallying cry, "Say it loud, gay is proud." Despite progress, the LGBTQ+ community faces ongoing challenges, making "pride" a vital symbol of resilience.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000, due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are allocating over Â£70 million in compensation and financial support to affected customers, following a review by Ofgem. The review revealed that suppliers often switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement, particularly during the cost of living crisis. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent, and enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo.</p>

The cameras aim to reduce shoplifting by identifying when items are not scanned correctly, showing a live-action replay to the customer. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, with retailers facing significant losses. While some welcome the tech as a way to improve the checkout process, others fear it could lead to more invasive surveillance measures.</p>

          <p>Planned Parenthood has once again halted abortions in Missouri after the state's Supreme Court ordered new rulings in a legal dispute over an abortion ban previously struck down by voters. The court instructed a district judge to reconsider her rulings that allowed abortions to resume, emphasizing the need to assess potential harms from allowing abortions. Missouri's Attorney General argued that Planned Parenthood had not sufficiently proven harm to women in the absence of restrictions. Planned Parenthood has since canceled abortion appointments and hopes to return to court soon, while a ballot measure for an amendment reimposing a ban with exceptions for pregnancies caused by sexual assault or incest may appear in 2026.</p>

Their concerns include the costs of electronic tagging and the possibility of repeat offenders avoiding jail.

          <p>A report backed by the London mayor advocates for the decriminalization of possessing small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The London Drugs Commission's report, chaired by Lord Falconer, includes 42 recommendations, such as removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Proponents argue that current laws disproportionately affect ethnic communities and fail to address medicinal use. Critics, however, warn that decriminalization could wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful, while police officials express concerns about increased crime and antisocial behavior if drug laws are relaxed.</p>

The fine includes Â£104.5m for sewage operation breaches and Â£18.2m for shareholder payouts deemed "undeserved". This comes as Thames Water faces criticism for its performance and struggles with a Â£20bn debt, despite securing emergency funding.

The Solicitor General argues that the judge's move exceeds his authority and jeopardizes national security negotiations. The Supreme Court has previously ruled that non-citizens on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law," but the specifics remain contested, and the administration is seeking definitive guidance on the matter.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intensifying efforts to stop the smuggling of Pop Mart toys, particularly the Labubu and Molly series, as prices surge amid the retailer's global expansion.

The price differences between overseas and domestic markets, influenced by currency fluctuations and discounts, drive travelers to buy toys abroad and bring them back into China.

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising fears of capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields hover near record highs, potentially triggering a carry trade unwind. Higher Japan government bond yields could lead to Japanese investors pulling funds from the U.S., causing a global financial market disruption. This shift is driven by structural factors, including Japanese life insurance companies meeting buying requirements and the Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases. Analysts warn of increased borrowing costs and a potential end to U.S. exceptionalism, with funds returning to Japan and impacting global markets.</p>

This decision comes after the government suspended taking orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller ones. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries plans to allocate 100,000 tons of reserve rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. The government is working to ease the burden on households facing doubled retail rice prices, with reserve rice likely sold at around 1,800 yen per 5 kilograms.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents about alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, has lost his appeal to reduce his prison term. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's appeal to reduce his five-year and eight-month sentence. McBride's team expressed disappointment and announced plans to challenge the decision in the High Court, arguing that it cannot be a crime to expose a crime. Rights advocates have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride remains the only person imprisoned over the alleged war crimes.</p>
