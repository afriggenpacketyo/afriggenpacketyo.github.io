          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement granting the U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral reserves, intending to provide the U.S. with a stake in Ukraine's stability and reconstruction. This deal establishes a joint investment fund, with both countries having equal voting rights, focusing on the development of mineral, oil, and gas projects. Ukraine retains full control over its natural resources, infrastructure, and subsoil, and profits from the fund will be reinvested in the Ukrainian economy for the first decade, with potential distribution between partners thereafter. The agreement aims to attract significant resources for reconstruction, stimulate economic growth, and introduce advanced technologies from the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board has preliminarily approved rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising costs for landlords. The board voted 5 to 4 in favor of increases ranging from 1.75 to 4.75 percent for one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the coming months. Tenant advocates argue the increases will exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords claim the adjustments are insufficient to cover rising expenses. The decision reflects the ongoing tension between protecting affordable housing and ensuring landlords can maintain their properties, with Mayor Adams noting the need to balance tenant burdens and the quality of rent-stabilized homes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for using an altered photograph of a deportee, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to falsely claim he had MS-13 gang tattoos. During an interview, President Trump insisted Abrego Garcia had the tattoos, even after being corrected that the “MS-13” lettering was superimposed onto the photo. The White House has declined to explain why President Trump would not accept that Mr. Abrego Garcia does not in fact have “MS-13” tattooed on his hand. The administration has faced increasing scrutiny from the courts over its handling of Mr. Abrego Garcia, and it has chosen to respond to that scrutiny by waging a war of public opinion.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, visitors to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., shared their reflections on the war, revealing a mix of sadness, fury, and, for some, a sense of closure. Veterans, tourists, and students gathered at the memorial, a black granite wall inscribed with the names of the dead, to remember loved ones and contemplate the war's impact. While the conflict's central role in American culture has faded, many veterans expressed a softening of their anger and a greater willingness to discuss the grief they had long buried.

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) conducted the test along the Temescal Ridge Trail to analyze flame location and size, hoping to trace the fire's origin. Investigators are exploring whether the blaze was a reignition of an earlier fire sparked by fireworks or if it was caused by human activity on January 7. The article notes that some homeowners have sued the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging failure to properly prepare for and respond to the wildfire.</p>

          <p>The Colorado football program's decision to retire Travis Hunter's and Shedeur Sanders' jerseys has sparked controversy, with former players questioning the lack of a formal process. Unlike past retirements, Sanders and Hunter had not yet graduated, leading to accusations of preferential treatment. Michael Jones, a former Colorado player, criticized the absence of a clear policy, while Darian Hagan expressed shock that the decision was at the discretion of the athletic director and head coach. The article highlights concerns that the retirements contribute to an erasure of the program's football legacy, contrasting it with the strict policies in place for the athletics Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>The Senate has failed to block President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs, as a resolution led by Democratic and Republican senators fell short of the votes needed due to Republican opposition. The resolution aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs, but most Republicans united against it, supporting the White House's position. The vote highlights ongoing anxiety over the potential economic disruption caused by the tariffs, even as the administration asserts progress on trade deals. The article also mentions the House's efforts to quash attempts to block the tariffs, reflecting a partisan divide on trade policy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter of 2025, attributed to businesses stockpiling goods ahead of President Trump's tariff policies. The gross domestic product (GDP) shrank at an annual rate of 0.3%, a significant downturn from the previous quarter's growth. While economists caution that the figures may be skewed by a surge in imports, the slowdown signals potential headwinds for the economy due to the implementation of steep import fees.
