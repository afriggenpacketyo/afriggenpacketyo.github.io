          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions, dismissing concerns about tariffs. China has indicated they will accept deliveries, with the first shipments planned for June. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, which are manufactured in South Carolina, but the company expects to recoup most of these costs when the planes are exported. The duties would only affect deliveries to U.S. airlines, according to Ortberg. Optimism is shown through the continued resumption of airplane deliveries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing legal challenges after targeting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students on visas, escalating an existing feud. Initially, Harvard's certification was revoked, leading to a lawsuit and a temporary restraining order. The Department of Homeland Security has since given Harvard 30 days to demonstrate compliance with visa program requirements. A federal judge has maintained the restraining order, signaling a potentially lengthy legal battle closely monitored by other universities and international students. The core legal questions revolve around the legitimacy and motivations behind the government's actions, particularly concerning free speech rights and ideological targeting.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on federal environmental impact studies for major projects, potentially speeding up infrastructure development. The case, Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, involved a proposed railroad line in Utah. Justice Kavanaugh's opinion emphasizes deference to agency decisions and restricts consideration of indirect environmental impacts, which mirrors the arguments of those who advocate for increased infrastructure development. This decision is expected to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a law often used to challenge development projects, and aligns with a bipartisan push to streamline environmental reviews.</p>

The decision also forfeited the U.S. governmentâ€™s right to purchase doses ahead of a potential pandemic and built on a previous government investment of $175 million last year.

Despite his 2005 conviction for possessing child sexual abuse material, Le Scouarnec was able to continue practicing medicine, raising questions about hospital oversight.

          <p>A new study indicates that significant glacier shrinkage is unavoidable over the next several centuries, even if global temperatures stabilize at current levels. Researchers estimate that glaciers outside of ice sheets could lose roughly one-third of their mass, contributing to sea level rise. However, limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels could save twice as much ice compared to the current warming trajectory. The study emphasizes that every tenth of a degree less of warming will help preserve glacial ice, highlighting the importance of ambitious climate measures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, with sales growth driven by its data center division. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a market estimated at $50 billion. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Looking ahead, Nvidia is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers, a process called inference, and is designed for its latest Blackwell chips.</p>
