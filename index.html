          <p>The once-warm relationship between the U.S. and India has soured significantly over trade disputes. President Trump has labeled India the "tariff king" and threatened further levies, a stark reversal from previous commitments to deepen economic ties. While India prioritizes its national interests and faces domestic pressure to stand firm, experts note that shared concerns over China remain a foundational element of the partnership. The breakdown in trust has cast doubt on the future of a bilateral trade deal, with officials on both sides expressing pessimism about reaching a reconciliation soon.</p>

          <p>The BBC has proceeded with broadcasting a new season of MasterChef, which was filmed before its hosts, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were dismissed following a misconduct investigation. The decision has drawn criticism from broadcast unions and women's rights groups, who argue that airing the show rewards bad behavior. To address the controversy, the episodes have been re-edited to minimize the hosts' presence, and one contestant was removed at her own request. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated she would not be watching, highlighting public disapproval of how the situation was handled.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dresden, Germany, have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 500-pound British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge. The evacuation zone includes several hotels and the city's historic Frauenkirche, a major tourist landmark. This marks the second such large-scale evacuation in Dresden this year, highlighting the persistent danger of unexploded bombs from the war. The article also notes German business concerns over a recent EU-US tariff agreement, which a majority fear will create new economic burdens.</p>

          <p>Meghan Markle faces a renewed legal challenge from her estranged half-sister, Samantha Markle, who has appealed the dismissal of her defamation lawsuit. An oral argument is scheduled for September, bringing the contentious family dispute back into the public eye. Royal experts suggest this legal entanglement could undermine Prince Harry's reported attempts to reconcile with the British royal family, who are sensitive to public legal battles. The ongoing conflict is seen as a potential obstacle for the Sussexes as they try to navigate their relationship with the monarchy while building their new life and brand in the U.S.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to continue offering the highest shareholder yield among banks in the Greater China region, estimated between 9 and 11 percent for the current year. The projection is supported by HSBC's recent announcement of a 10 US cent per share dividend and a new $3 billion stock buyback program. JPMorgan analysts also raised their price target for the bank's stock, suggesting confidence in its financial stability. The report notes that HSBC's capital buffer is strong enough to withstand potential impairments without affecting its dividend or buyback plans. (not investment advice)</p>

In a recent interview, he claimed to have secured a $550 billion "bonus" from Japan and $600 billion in investment commitments from the European Union as part of new trade deals. When pressed for details, the President stated the funds could be invested as he wished. This rhetoric is part of his administration's playbook to frame new trade agreements, which include reduced tariffs, as major financial wins for the United States.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor's operating profit for the first quarter fell by 50% year-over-year, significantly missing analyst estimates due to the impact of U.S. auto tariffs and a stronger yen. The Japanese automaker has been forced to offer price cuts to maintain its market share in the U.S. following the implementation of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles. Despite the poor quarterly results, Honda raised its full-year profit forecast, anticipating that the negative impact from tariffs will be less than previously feared. The situation highlights the broader challenges facing Japanese carmakers from ongoing trade headwinds with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals that Russia has more than doubled its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine since President Trump took office in January, despite his calls for a ceasefire. Data from the Ukrainian Air Force shows a sharp escalation in munitions launched, reaching the highest levels of the war. This increase occurred even as the Trump administration twice paused military aid to Ukraine in an effort to broker peace. Critics suggest these pauses, combined with Russia's ramped-up domestic weapons production, may have emboldened Moscow to intensify its aerial campaign against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) has warned that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must raise taxes to cover a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances. According to the think tank, the government is on track to miss its self-imposed borrowing rules without a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes." Niesr suggests that weakening economic growth and the watering down of planned welfare cuts have contributed to the fiscal gap. The analysis presents a trilemma for the Chancellor, forcing a choice between her spending plans, manifesto tax promises, and commitment to fiscal discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being a frequent occurrence in football, the throw-in remains a largely undeveloped tactical element of the game. This article explores how teams could innovate beyond the simple sideline restart, drawing inspiration from Rory Delap's famous long throws for Stoke City. Suggestions include training specialists for long, flat deliveries and developing set-piece routines similar to corners, especially since the offside rule does not apply. The analysis argues that the sport's general dismissal of the throw-in as a serious tactical opportunity has stifled creativity, leaving significant potential for teams to gain a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science reveals that the Great Barrier Reef has suffered its largest-ever annual decline in live coral cover. The unprecedented loss is a direct result of a severe and widespread mass coral bleaching event in early 2024, driven by record-high ocean temperatures. Surveys showed that the northern and southern regions were hit hardest, with coral cover dropping by as much as a third. Scientists warn that the increased volatility in coral levels points to an ecosystem under severe stress from climate change, though they emphasize it is still worth fighting to protect.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man is bringing a High Court challenge against London's Metropolitan Police after its live facial recognition (LFR) technology wrongly identified him as a wanted suspect. Shaun Thompson described the experience of being stopped and questioned as "intimidating" and compared the technology to "stop and search on steroids." The case, supported by privacy group Big Brother Watch, is the first of its kind and challenges the legality and accountability of the increasingly used surveillance tool. The Met Police, which plans to double its use of LFR, maintains that its deployment is lawful and effective in catching dangerous offenders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 41% tariff rate on Syria, the highest for any country, just months after lifting long-standing sanctions. While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move is highly symbolic and undermines efforts to rebuild the devastated nation. The tariffs threaten to deter foreign investment crucial for Syria's recovery after 13 years of war and the recent toppling of the Assad regime. Observers suggest the policy may be a form of economic leverage, designed to influence the political behavior of Syria's new transitional government, rather than a measure to address a trade imbalance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks continued their winning streak with a 100-91 victory over an Indiana Fever team playing without the injured Caitlin Clark. The Sparks' balanced offense, led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson with 25 points each, secured the win against one of the league's hottest teams. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown from the stands onto the court, the third such incident in the WNBA in a week. The object landed near Indiana's Sophie Cunningham before being kicked away by Plum, with officials and players quickly resuming the game.</p>

The move is expected to bolster ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service by adding valuable NFL content. The final agreement is still subject to negotiation, approval from NFL owners, and regulatory review, but it marks a major step in the long-discussed consolidation of the league's media properties.</p>

          <p>China is facing a rocket shortage that could hinder its efforts to build a satellite internet network to compete with SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang project appears to have priority access to the country's Long March rockets, leaving other ambitious projects like Shanghai's Qianfan to seek launches from the private sector. Qianfan recently issued a tender for seven launches to deploy 94 satellites, highlighting the growing demand for launch capacity. This bottleneck creates a divide between national-level projects and regional ambitions, potentially forcing China to prioritize one candidate in the race against Starlink.</p>

Against a backdrop of rising global tensions, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the growing acceptance of nuclear weapons and called on the world to learn from the tragedy.

Police records indicate Coristine was surrounded by a group of teenagers, while other accounts suggested he was intervening to defend someone else. The D.C.
