          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Newark, New Jersey. According to interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials to leave the facility, leading to his arrest. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey, had been participating in a demonstration at the facility. At least three U.S. House Democrats from New Jersey were also present at the detention center on Friday.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending the writ of habeas corpus, which protects individuals from unlawful detention by the government. Miller indicated that this option is being considered in response to challenges in deporting undocumented immigrants, particularly those involving habeas claims. He argued that courts are obstructing the executive branch's efforts to deport immigrants and that Congress had stripped federal courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases. Miller's comments reflect the administration's stance that the U.S. faces an "invasion" of undocumented migrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hostilities between India and Pakistan over Kashmir are raising fears of a broader conflict, potentially involving the U.S. and China. According to experts, China's close alliance with Pakistan and the increasing closeness between the U.S. and India could turn the conflict into a proxy war. Escalation could lead to the dismantling of Pakistan, impacting Afghanistan, Iran, and China, particularly its investments in the Gwadar Port. While India aims to limit the conflict to targeting terrorists, maintaining an anti-India stance is crucial for the Pakistani military's legitimacy. The possibility of inadvertent escalation between the two nuclear-armed powers remains a significant concern.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has scheduled a resentencing hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez for May 13 and 14, following multiple postponements due to legal challenges. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are seeking eligibility for parole under a resentencing petition filed by former District Attorney George GascÃ³n. The current District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't shown full insight into their crimes. The judge rejected Hochman's request to withdraw the resentencing petition, setting the stage for an adversarial hearing where witnesses will testify about the brothers' rehabilitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses smart strategies for paying off a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), emphasizing the importance of having a clear payoff plan. Homeowners can take advantage of the interest-only payment period to pay down the principal, especially when interest rates are lower. Monitoring the interest rate climate helps in making informed decisions about larger payments. Utilizing the HELOC for eligible home repairs and renovations can provide tax deductions, further aiding in repayment. Consulting with a lending expert is recommended to build a personalized repayment strategy, considering the home serves as collateral.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a brief radar outage, adding to recent disruptions that have intensified concerns about safety.

Solid-state batteries eliminate flammable liquid electrolytes, making them safer and allowing for faster charging and increased range. Despite challenges in mass production, Factorial has established a pilot factory in South Korea and is collaborating with major automakers.

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, offering an alternative to traditional Pap smears. Teal Health's Teal Wand detects human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for nearly all cervical cancers. The test allows women to collect samples from home and send them to a certified lab for testing. The decision was based on a study showing self-collected samples had the same performance as clinician-collected samples. The test will be rolled out in June for patients aged 25 to 65, with plans to work with insurance providers for coverage.</p>

          <p>A former model testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial, alleging that he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and again in 2006. Kaja Sokola told the court that Weinstein made her touch his genitals at his Manhattan apartment in 2002 and forcibly performed oral sex on her in a hotel room in 2006. Weinstein's lawyers sought to raise doubts about Sokola's allegations, noting that she did not mention the 2006 claim for years, even in her own lawsuits. Weinstein is already serving a 16-year sentence for a 2022 sexual assault conviction in California.</p>
