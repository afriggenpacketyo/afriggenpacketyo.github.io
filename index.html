          <p>An Asus subsidiary, Taiwan AI Cloud, is collaborating with the island's National Centre for High-Performance Computing to build a new supercomputer. Located in Tainan, the project will launch its first phase in December with a capacity of 80 petaflops, eventually reaching 250 petaflops. This initiative is a key part of Taiwan's strategy to significantly enhance its computational power by at least 50% and establish itself as a top-three computing power in Asia. The government aims to expand the island's total capacity to 1,200 petaflops by 2029.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Uganda, a country to which he has no known ties, following his mistaken deportation to El Salvador. Ábrego García, who fled gang violence in El Salvador at 16, was previously granted protection from deportation to his home country due to a "well-founded fear" of persecution. His case has become a symbol of the administration's stringent immigration crackdown, drawing criticism from legal scholars and human rights advocates for what they describe as a rush to deport individuals without due process. His lawyers argue the latest deportation attempt is a vindictive action for challenging his initial removal.</p>

Williams, a 23-time grand slam champion, praised Sharapova as one of the few players who consistently challenged her to perform at her best. In her acceptance speech, Sharapova acknowledged the mutual respect and intense rivalry, stating it was a "gift" to have someone who motivated her to such heights. The ceremony also honored the dominant doubles team of Mike and Bob Bryan, celebrating the careers of some of tennis's most influential figures.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chain Cracker Barrel experienced a significant stock plunge, losing nearly $100 million in market value after unveiling a new, more modern logo. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, is part of a broader effort to refresh the brand's image amid slowing growth. The move drew criticism from some conservative commentators and marketing experts, who argued it alienates the company's traditional customer base by abandoning its well-established, old-timey aesthetic. Cracker Barrel stated that its core values remain unchanged despite the visual update. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two new air defense missiles, according to state media outlet KCNA. The report claimed the test demonstrated the "superior combat capability" of the improved weapon systems but did not disclose the specific type of missiles or the location of the launch.

          <h2>UK Government Announces Overhaul of Asylum Appeals System to Expedite Cases</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of the asylum appeals system to reduce processing times and decrease the number of migrants housed in hotels. A new independent body staffed by adjudicators will be created to hear cases more quickly, addressing what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "unacceptable delays" in the current system. It currently takes over a year on average for an appeal to be heard, with 51,000 cases backlogged. This initiative aims to regain control over the asylum process as the government faces pressure to end its costly reliance on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Thousands of St George's and Union Jack flags are being displayed on lampposts across England, a phenomenon that began in Birmingham and has since spread nationwide. The movement, partly organized by a group called the "Weoley Warriors," is seen by some as a display of patriotism and an effort to "take the flag back from the racists." However, the trend has made others uncomfortable, viewing it as a sign of rising xenophobia and division, particularly as the flags have been used by far-right groups and at protests against asylum seeker accommodations. The displays have ignited a complex debate about national identity, political expression, and the symbolism of the flags in modern Britain.</p>

While many airports offer exemptions or discounts, the system is described as inconsistent and complex, often requiring pre-registration online which can be difficult for some users. The call for reform highlights the financial and logistical burdens placed on disabled travelers, with the charity arguing that airports have "allowed greed to cloud their judgement." The BBC's investigation found a wide variance in policies across the UK's 20 busiest airports, prompting demands for a standardized, fee-free approach.</p>

Driven by a need to understand the event that took his father, Shane later pursued a career as a safety officer in the same industry.

A leading art scholar has raised serious doubts, noting the paintings were never documented or shown during the artist's lifetime and that the provenance story is incomplete.

The call comes after incidents where children suffered anaphylactic shock from consuming products like hot cross buns and ice cream that unexpectedly contained pea protein. Experts have also suggested including other allergens like pine nuts and buckwheat on the list. Families argue that the increasing use of pea protein as a hidden ingredient in various foods creates a "game of roulette" for those with the allergy, which they say is often not taken as seriously as other food allergies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has reportedly been blocking Ukraine from using U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, such as ATACMS, for strikes deep inside Russian territory since late spring. According to The Wall Street Journal, this restriction is part of a Trump administration strategy to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin. A "review mechanism" now allegedly requires approval from the U.S. defense secretary for the use of these weapons, a shift from the broader authority granted by the previous administration. This move comes amid increasing control over munitions supplied to Ukraine as the U.S. aims to manage escalation while navigating its own depleted stockpiles.</p>

However, critics, including the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, suggest it is a waste of money to treat something that isn't there and warn of potential long-term side effects and building a tolerance.

          <h2>US Immigrant Population Declines by Over One Million Since January Amid Trump Policies</h2>

          <p>The immigrant population in the United States has decreased by over one million people since Donald Trump began his second term in January, marking a reversal of a 50-year growth trend. A Pew Research Center study found the number of immigrants dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including previous asylum restrictions and the current administration's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, which include mass deportations. This shift reflects a significant change in U.S. immigration dynamics, with 750,000 immigrant workers also leaving the labor force.</p>

          <p>Trainers at the now-closed Marineland Antibes in France are sexually stimulating a male orca, Keijo, to prevent him from inbreeding with his mother, Wikie. The two whales remain at the facility as officials and activists have yet to agree on a rehoming plan following a French law banning whale shows. An activist group captured footage of the procedure, which the zoo described as necessary to relieve the adolescent male's "tensions" and prevent fighting. The practice has been condemned by former trainers and activists as a "perverse new low," raising further concerns about the welfare of the animals left in limbo.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened its new Wonsan Kalma coastal resort, with the first international visitors being tightly controlled tour groups from Russia. Tourists describe an experience on pristine, nearly empty beaches, but were constantly accompanied by guides and guards who restricted interaction with locals and photography of certain areas. The resort, built near a missile testing site, is part of Kim Jong Un's plan to boost tourism, yet access remains highly limited even for citizens of allied nations like China. The trips offer a rare, albeit heavily curated, glimpse into a country largely isolated from the rest of the world.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to all work on the Revolution Wind project, an offshore wind farm off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut that was 80% complete. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited the need to review the project for "national security interests" in light of a new executive order to re-evaluate existing wind energy leases. The governors of both states have vowed to fight the decision, which they say jeopardizes their climate goals and could kill over 350,000 homes' access to clean energy. Critics have linked the move to corruption, suggesting it is a favor to the oil industry.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, have digitally recreated the faces of two men from 2,500-year-old skulls. The skulls were excavated from Kondagai, a burial site linked to the Keeladi archaeological site, which suggests a sophisticated urban civilization existed in southern India around 580 BC. The facial reconstructions reveal features primarily of Ancient Ancestral South Indians, with traces of other ancestries, hinting at ancient migration and mixing of populations. The project aims to shed light on the region's ancestry and challenge narratives that have historically centered India's urban development in the north.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have both been denied parole in their first eligibility hearings since being convicted for the 1989 murders of their parents. The proceedings were marked by drama when an audio recording of Erik's hearing was "erroneously" released by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, nearly derailing Lyle's subsequent hearing. Attorneys and family members reacted with anger, accusing officials of creating a "public spectacle" and violating the family's privacy. Despite the disruption, the parole board proceeded, ultimately rejecting both brothers' petitions for release; they will be eligible again in three years.</p>

They accused the DOJ of "stonewalling" and called for the full, unredacted release of all files.

          <p>Major European parcel companies, including DHL and the national postal services of the UK, France, and Spain, are temporarily halting some shipments to the United States. The suspension is a response to a new Trump administration policy ending the "de minimis" rule, which had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The companies cite ambiguity and a lack of time to implement new logistical systems for collecting customs duties and transmitting data to U.S. Customs. The issue is less about the cost of the tariffs themselves and more about the significant administrative and technical challenges posed by the abrupt policy change.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to overhaul sentencing rules in England and Wales to give courts more power to impose non-custodial punishments. The proposed reforms would allow judges to issue bans from pubs, concerts, and sporting events, as well as driving and travel bans, for a wider range of offenses. This move aims to "toughen up community punishments" and is part of a broader strategy to manage prison overcrowding by reducing the use of custodial sentences for less serious crimes. The Ministry of Justice stated these changes would provide more options for restricting offenders' freedoms while they serve their sentences in the community.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, are managing the impact of President Trump's increased tariffs through a mix of strategies, such as absorbing costs, diversifying sourcing, and making selective price hikes. While companies had initially warned of widespread price increases, executives now indicate the impact has been more measured, though costs are still rising. Consumer spending has remained resilient, particularly for higher-income households, but some shoppers are adjusting their behavior in response to higher prices on certain goods. Retailers have also mitigated effects by importing goods early, but expect tariff-related cost pressures to continue through the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
