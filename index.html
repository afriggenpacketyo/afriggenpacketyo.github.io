          <p>President Trump attended the opening night of 'Les Misérables' at the Kennedy Center, while Defense Secretary Hegseth defended the deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles amid Democratic objections. Hegseth testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee following a trip to Fort Bragg, where Trump delivered a campaign-style speech vowing to suppress "anarchy" and "liberate" Los Angeles. The President's appearance at the Kennedy Center, juxtaposed with the military mobilization, underscores the administration's focus on both cultural events and domestic security measures, raising questions about the balance between artistic expression and perceived threats to public order. This event highlights the intersection of politics, arts, and national security under the Trump administration. The optimism score is therefore tempered by the ongoing controversies surrounding the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a dying star's explosion, providing valuable data for modern astronomers. The record, found in a formal report to the Ming dynasty's Emperor Yongle, describes the star's size, color, and brightness, helping confirm that the event was a nova. This discovery, published in The Astronomical Journal by researchers from China, Germany, and Chile, settles a debate about the nature of the 1408 astronomical event and offers unprecedented insights into the star's position.

          <p>Hong Kong aims to lead in global finance by implementing comprehensive stablecoin regulations, addressing past industry setbacks. The city's government seeks to unlock value in the sector, positioning itself ahead of the US and with a friendlier regulatory stance than Singapore. Combined with vast offshore yuan holdings and China's restricted cryptocurrency use, the new law could secure Hong Kong's role in the stablecoin market. The legislative push underscores an intensifying East-West contest over financial influence in the digital era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a supermassive black hole in the early Universe emitting jets of plasma at least twice the size of the Milky Way. The quasar, J1601+3102, is observed as it was less than 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang, making it the largest structure of its kind from that era. The black hole's properties suggest that powerful jets can form without extreme mass or accretion rates. The discovery helps scientists understand the growth and evolution of black holes in the early Universe.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that challenges the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86-million-year-old skeletons, found in Mongolia, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery reveals a transitional phase between smaller, fleet-footed predators and the larger, more formidable tyrannosaurs. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of features crucial to tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that provided a strong jaw.</p>
