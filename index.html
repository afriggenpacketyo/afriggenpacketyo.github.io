          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 17:33:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge declared a mistrial in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a Michigan police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya, a black man, during a traffic stop in April 2022. The jury was unable to reach a verdict, leading to the mistrial, which is a partial victory for Schurr, who could still face another trial. The incident, captured on police bodycam and other sources, shows Lyoya fleeing from Schurr, followed by a scuffle over the officer's Taser before Schurr shoots Lyoya, who was face-down on the ground. The defense centered on Schurr's fear of the Taser, while the killing sparked protests and renewed questions about police brutality. Schurr was fired from the Grand Rapids police department soon after being charged in 2022.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how former President Trump's focus on attacking federal judges who rule against his policies is undermining the court system and shifting the focus away from law and precedent. Legal scholars argue that this approach delegitimizes the courts and could lead to disregard for court rulings. Trump's attacks risk physical harm against judges, who have faced a growing number of threats. The article also notes that while judges are not purely objective, the increasing focus on their personalities rather than the legal merits of cases is dangerous for the judiciary.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Rupnow, the father of Natalie Rupnow, the 15-year-old who killed two people in the Abundant Life Christian School shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, last year, was arrested and charged with multiple felonies. The charges include contributing to the delinquency of a child and providing a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 resulting in death. Rupnow legally purchased the firearm used in the shooting, and his daughter had regular access to a gun safe and other weapons in the home. The teen shooter, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, had an obsession with mass violence and kept a journal with drawings and videos of mass violence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to cut a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use naloxone, a lifesaving overdose reversal drug, despite a recent dip in overdose deaths credited in part to wider naloxone access. The grant money is used by state and local organizations for training, administration, and distribution of the medication. Experts and non-profit agencies warn that the cuts could exacerbate the overdose crisis, especially as the administration also proposes wider cuts to the Health and Human Services budget, which would eliminate SAMHSA. The best way to continue reducing overdose deaths is to expand federal funding for prevention efforts, including access to naloxone, medication-assisted treatment, and harm reduction strategies.</p>

          <p>A football fan is suing the NFL for $100 million, claiming "severe emotional distress and trauma" due to former Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders dropping to the fifth round of the NFL draft. The lawsuit alleges antitrust violations and possible race discrimination, as well as misrepresentation of the drafting process. The fan claims that slanderous statements about Sanders harmed his reputation and potential as a player. Legal experts suggest the lawsuit is unlikely to succeed due to issues of standing and the difficulty of proving a race discrimination claim. The professor of law said that the NFL's lawyers will likely file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit for failure to sustain a claim, and that will likely be the end of the matter.</p>

          <p>Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after President Trump announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rose by 0.6%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.1%. Bitcoin and crude oil prices climbed, while gold prices dipped, signaling rising investor confidence in riskier assets. The trade deal will include billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture. However, the 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain and other countries will remain in place, though there will be an exception for the first 100,000 vehicles exported to the U.S. from British automakers each year.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement that will reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free. The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump since entering office in January. The US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year. Tariffs on steel and aluminium have also been slashed, and the two sides have agreed to "reciprocal access" for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers.</p>

          <p>World Central Kitchen has closed its community soup kitchens across Gaza due to Israel's ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance, leaving the organization with empty warehouses and no replenishment of supplies. The closure affects 133,000 meals per day, exacerbating the already dire hunger situation in Gaza. The article says that malnutrition and hunger are becoming increasingly prevalent in the Gaza Strip as Israel's total blockade enters its third month, and aid agencies say supplies to treat and prevent malnutrition are running out. Scarce water supplies are also a factor, with water availability plummeting to an average of 3-5 liters per person per day.</p>

          <p>Following an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, West Point has scrubbed its curriculum of ideologies deemed "divisive" by President Trump, leading to canceled classes and resignations. The directive led to the removal of readings focusing on race, gender, and the darker aspects of American history, with some professors instructed to avoid mentioning atrocities against Native Americans. Two classes were scrapped midsemester for noncompliance, and works by Black authors were purged. This has led to questions about academic freedom and the politicization of the academy, with some faculty members resigning in protest.</p>

          <p>Economic data indicates that many companies plan to pass tariff costs on to consumers, potentially driving up prices. Surveys show that a majority of manufacturers and executives intend to pass tariff-related costs to customers.

Some companies, such as Stanley Black & Decker and Procter & Gamble, have already announced price increases to offset higher costs. This article is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>The risk of all-out war between India and Pakistan rose on Thursday, despite diplomatic attempts to de-escalate the conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries. On Wednesday, India said it carried out strikes on Pakistan in retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir last month. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with leaders from both countries on Thursday and emphasized the need for “immediate de-escalation,” according to State Department accounts of the calls. The diplomatic push was centered around the hope that the heaviest military engagement could be contained to the actions on early Wednesday.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain announced a deal that would reduce tariffs on some imports and deepen the economic relationship between the two countries, though the deal still has to be finalized. The Trump administration said it would open up export opportunities worth $5 billion for American businesses while bringing in $6 billion in tariff revenue. The agreement will come as a relief for Britain’s auto industry, which will now face 10 percent tariffs on the first 100,000 cars exported annually to the United States. British officials warned that the higher tariffs, which were about 25 percent, had endangered jobs in the country’s car industry.</p>
