        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has denied engaging in any trade negotiations with the United States, dismissing claims of progress as baseless during a press conference. A ministry spokesman, He Yadong, stated that if the U.S. genuinely seeks resolution, it must consider international and domestic voices, eliminate all unilateral tariffs on China, and pursue solutions through equitable dialogue. This denial underscores the ongoing tensions and lack of direct communication between the two economic powers regarding trade issues, indicating a potential stalemate in resolving trade disputes. The statement reflects China's firm stance against what it perceives as unfair tariffs and its insistence on equal terms for any future discussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law from April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists aged 16 and older, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. The new system will issue 'blue tickets,' allowing offenders to pay a fine and avoid indictment for over 100 violations, aiming to reduce accidents involving cyclists. Fines will range from 3,000 to 12,000 yen depending on the offense, with stricter penalties already in place for cycling under the influence of alcohol or using a mobile phone dangerously. This change reflects the government's efforts to address the increasing popularity of bicycles and ensure road safety.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci, experienced a 5% drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, signaling potential macroeconomic challenges for the luxury sector. Gucci sales, which constitute nearly half of the group's total revenue, plummeted by 25% due to ongoing efforts to revitalize the brand amidst changing consumer preferences. The overall weakness was driven by a 25% decline in Asia sales and a 13% dip in both North America and Europe, highlighting a broader downturn in the luxury market influenced by higher inflation and weaker economic conditions. The company is increasing its vigilance to weather the macroeconomic headwinds our industry faces, and management remains focused on executing action plans to reach strategic and financial objectives and strengthen the positioning of its Houses on all markets.

This decision acknowledges Lloyd's role as a pioneer for women in magic and reflects the society's shift towards inclusivity, despite remaining heavily male-dominated, with only 5% of its members being women. The event also honors Jenny Winstanley, Lloyd's friend who conceived the original plan, recognizing her contribution to breaking gender barriers in the magic community.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged as investors seek safe-haven assets amid trade turmoil, while U.S. Treasurys and the dollar have declined in value. This shift is attributed to concerns over U.S. trade policy under President Donald Trump, leading investors to view gold as a more reliable store of value. Analysts predict gold prices will continue to rise, potentially reaching $4,000 per ounce by 2026, as confidence in U.S. assets diminishes due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Unlike currencies or government bonds, gold carries no credit risk and is not tied to the economic or political trajectory of a single nation. (not investment advice)</p>

Algorithms must filter out harmful content from children's feeds, and platforms must establish streamlined reporting systems and designate a person accountable for children's safety.

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in was indicted on a bribery charge related to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline in Thailand. Prosecutors allege that Moon's former son-in-law received approximately $150,000 in salary and housing allowances from the airline between 2018 and 2020 as a bribe from Lee Sang-jik, the airline's controller. This indictment marks another instance of former South Korean leaders facing criminal investigations, a recurring trend in the country's political landscape.</p>

Measles cases have risen significantly, with a 20% increase in a year, and many children are missing routine vaccine doses.

          <p>Victims of violent crimes are advocating for a system where individuals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or stalking are required to live in restricted zones after their release from prison. This proposal aims to provide greater security and freedom for victims, who often feel confined by exclusion zones placed on their offenders. While the Ministry of Justice uses exclusion zones to prevent offenders from approaching victims, some experts raise concerns about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights. Victims argue that the emphasis should shift from protecting the rights of offenders to ensuring the safety and well-being of those who have been harmed.</p>

These protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge by ongoing conflict, are beginning to challenge Hamas' authority.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, an economist, assesses the likelihood of a U.S. recession, noting several indicators such as an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market odds. He emphasizes that these indicators offer probabilities rather than guarantees of an impending recession. He also states that a number of other early measures of actual economic activity can help us identify a recession. Based on current information, Frankel estimates the odds of a U.S. recession as high as 60% for the coming year, and even higher for the next four years, primarily due to trade tensions and policy uncertainties.
