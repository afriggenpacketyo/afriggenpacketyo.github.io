          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Trump's decision to deploy thousands of additional troops to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against immigration raids, calling the move a "deranged fantasy." The state is suing the president, arguing the deployment violates the US Constitution. The protests, which have spread to other US cities, were triggered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Latino areas. The LAPD reported numerous arrests and the use of less-than-lethal rounds to disperse demonstrators, while Trump defended his actions as preventing the city from "burning down."</p>

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom contradict Trump's portrayal, asserting local law enforcement can manage the situation. Newsom is suing the Trump administration for mobilizing the National Guard without state consent. The protests began after ICE raids in downtown Los Angeles and have resulted in arrests and property damage, including vehicles being set ablaze, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Anduril, a defense technology company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, highlighting the increasing interest and investment in defense tech. This marks the first time a defense tech company has led the list in its 13-year history, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also featured. The growth in the sector is driven by increased funding, with Anduril recently securing a $2.5 billion round, and a focus on modernizing military capabilities. The Trump administration's proposed increase in defense spending and the rise of dual-use technologies are contributing factors to this trend.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and his allies have characterized Los Angeles as a lawless city requiring military intervention, drawing criticism for authoritarian rhetoric. Despite Trump's claims of widespread chaos, demonstrations were confined to small areas, and life continued normally across much of the city. The Trump administration's characterization of the protests as a broader threat to the nation has been disputed by local officials. Experts argue that the rhetoric is designed to create fear and justify the use of state force.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's travel ban on citizens from 12 countries, including Venezuela, has caused confusion and fear among Venezuelans. Many travelers with valid visas rushed to reach the US before the ban took effect, causing flight prices to surge. The ban has disrupted travel plans and shattered long-held routines for many, with some expressing concerns about the future of family reunions in the US. The US justified the ban on Venezuela due to the government's refusal to accept deported nationals.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana news anchor, Bill Lunn, is suing a competitor, KTAL, for defamation after they reported he was caught in a sting operation targeting men seeking to exploit underage girls.

          <p>Scientists in Yosemite National Park have successfully helped the Northwestern pond turtle recover by removing invasive American bullfrogs from their habitat. The bullfrogs, which consume turtle hatchlings and other native species, had decimated the turtle population. After removing approximately 16,000 bullfrogs, researchers observed the return of younger turtles and other native species, restoring the food web. This study demonstrates a potential strategy for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems, though it requires intensive and ongoing efforts.</p>
