          <p>This CNBC article reports that a Florida federal judge has dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The ruling narrows the scope of a lawsuit accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian reports that the EU is considering imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in a fresh attempt to persuade Donald Trump to drop his current and proposed tariffs against the EU. The article details the potential targets of the tariffs, including Boeing and other sectors, as well as the EU's consultation with member states on potential litigation against the US. The article also notes that the EU said its new list of potential tariff targets was designed as preparation for a scenario in which some or all US tariffs remained after July – Trump’s deadline for deals.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether gold investment allocations should change in today's economy, given rising prices and economic uncertainty. The article presents perspectives from financial advisors, suggesting that while the traditional allocation is around 10% of your portfolio, this may not be best in today's economy. Experts recommend considering factors such as financial situation, risk appetite, and economic outlook when structuring investments, and note that there are situations in which it makes sense to increase your gold allocation — and situations in which it doesn't.</p>

          <p>This article reports that the world eagerly awaits official trade talks between China and the United States – their first since stratospheric tariff increases brought almost all bilateral goods shipments to a halt. Points of contention have been numerous, with Beijing claiming Washington blinked first and affirming confidence in the resilience of its domestic economy and the administration of US President Donald Trump doing the same. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Geneva during a four-day visit beginning Friday, in what most consider to be at most an overture for a future deal.</p>

The article also discusses the impact of the rate cut on borrowers and savers, as well as the Bank's expectations for future rate cuts and UK economic growth. The article states that US tariffs were also set to slow inflation, the Bank added, due to the impact of them on global trade leading to lower fossil fuel prices and the likely diversion of cheap goods from Asia to Europe which had originally been slated for America.</p>
