          <p>The UK has intensified its response to Israel's military actions in Gaza, citing concerns over the humanitarian crisis and a lack of progress towards a ceasefire. The government has suspended trade deal talks, summoned the Israeli ambassador, and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers accused of human rights abuses. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the military escalation as "morally unjustifiable" and accused the Netanyahu government of isolating Israel from its allies. Despite supporting Israel's right to self-defense, the UK is now taking concrete steps to pressure Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and end its military operations, highlighting growing international concern over the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump Administration has been accused of illegally deporting two Asian immigrants to South Sudan, defying court orders to halt such removals without due process.

Immigration lawyers argue that this action violates a previous court order requiring that detainees be given adequate notice and the opportunity to challenge removals to third countries.

As an example, Home Depot's stock initially rose after reporting earnings but later declined due to concerns that higher bond yields could slow the housing market.

          <p>If Republicans pass their proposed tax and spending megabill, the U.S. federal debt could reach record levels, exceeding 113% of the nation's economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects the debt will surpass the previous record set after World War II, and the Republican bill would widen this gap by extending tax cuts and increasing military spending. Budget experts warn that the bill could lead to a debt of 129% of the economy by 2034, raising concerns about the long-term financial stability of the United States. The rise in debt is also influenced by elevated interest rates, making it more costly for the government to borrow money.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is demanding answers from the Trump administration regarding the deportation of migrants to South Sudan, citing concerns about due process violations. Immigration lawyers claim that two Asian migrants were deported to the violence-plagued country against court orders. The Justice Department stated that one migrant was returned to Myanmar, but declined to disclose the destination of the second migrant, citing classified information. The judge warned that officials involved in the deportations could face criminal sanctions, highlighting the legal and ethical implications of the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a $175 billion missile defense shield, dubbed "Golden Dome," aimed at intercepting threats from space. The project, led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, is reminiscent of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program. Trump stated the system would be operational in three years and capable of intercepting missiles launched from anywhere in the world. While some experts support improving the nation's defense against aerial threats, others question the cost and feasibility of developing such a system in a short timeframe.</p>

          <p>An essay in The New York Times examines the destructive nature of the Trump presidency, highlighting assaults on institutions like the law, education, and medical research. Scholars argue that the gutting of expertise and experience, coupled with attacks on foreign alliances and ethical standards, may have long-lasting consequences. Some compare Trump to Andrew Johnson, citing his actions as hindering reconciliation and equality, while others emphasize the lasting damage to America's reputation and trust in its government. The essay explores whether Trump's agenda is driven by his own instincts or by conservative elites seeking to advance their goals through his presidency.</p>

Excellent.\n\nEzri Konsa (Aston Villa): It is not nice for me to talk about Aston Villa players in a really good way, but these guys are performing big at the moment. An excellent performance and he is growing more as a man and as a leader under Unai Emery. I can see him being a real threat for England in the World Cup - and starting.\n\nConnor Bradley (Liverpool): A lot of eyes on him. Not only with Trent leaving but what looks like Jeremie Frimpong joining. I think he has been fantastic and showcased how good he can be going forward with a lovely assist at Brighton.
