          <p>SoftBank's shares experienced a significant 13% surge following the announcement of its $5.4 billion acquisition of ABB's robotics division. This strategic move is poised to bolster SoftBank's footprint in the Artificial Intelligence sector, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's ambitious vision for "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will drive groundbreaking evolution. The acquisition, pending global regulatory approval, also means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. This development underscores SoftBank's aggressive strategy to position itself at the forefront of the burgeoning AI industry through targeted investments and acquisitions, further solidifying its influence in the global technology landscape.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans largely voted against legislation that would have required President Trump to seek congressional authorization before using deadly military force against drug cartels. The 48-51 vote, mostly along party lines, came after the Trump administration asserted broad presidential war powers, leading to the destruction of four vessels and 21 deaths in the Caribbean as part of anti-narcotics operations. Democrats and some Republicans expressed unease, citing potential violations of U.S. and international law, and a lack of information regarding the legal justification and operational specifics of the strikes. This legislative attempt, brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, aimed to reassert congressional oversight over military actions but ultimately failed to pass, highlighting ongoing tensions over executive power.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, Ricardo Leonel Mejia, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the repeated sexual assault of an 11-year-old girl in Virginia Beach. Mejia pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including sexual assault of a child under 13, indecent liberties, and statutory burglary, after the victim's mother discovered the abuse. This case has ignited a contentious debate among Virginia's political leaders regarding the extent of cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Mejia will serve his sentence in Virginia before being transferred to ICE custody, underscoring the complex interplay between severe criminal offenses and immigration enforcement policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has experienced a significant decline in membership, with figures almost halving from nearly 118,000 in 2020, when Sir Ed Davey became leader, to 60,000 currently. This drop, revealed by BBC analysis, occurs despite the party achieving its most successful general election in terms of seats won last year. Experts suggest that while the Liberal Democrats have performed well electorally, a perceived lack of a clear path to government may be deterring new members. This trend contrasts sharply with the Green Party's substantial membership increase, highlighting a challenge for the Liberal Democrats in converting electoral support into sustained party engagement.</p>

This breakthrough follows intense negotiations and aims to facilitate the entry of aid and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement brings a glimmer of hope for an end to a war that has resulted in an immense human cost and widespread displacement.</p>

          <p>This article details the dramatic escalation of President Trump's campaign of retribution against political opponents, highlighted by his public calls for jailing the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, and the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. The piece argues that the "guardrails" of Trump's first term are gone, with a pliant attorney general now seemingly taking legal action against those Trump targets. It suggests Trump's fixation on his legacy and past legal challenges fuels this revenge crusade, which has become a driving motivation. The administration is reportedly using various government levers, including the Justice Department, to punish critics, signaling a significant and concerning shift in established political norms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon Press Association has expressed an impasse in negotiations with the Defense Department over new credential restrictions, which reporters claim send a "message of intimidation." The proposed policy requires journalists to acknowledge not disclosing classified or "controlled unclassified information" without authorization, threatening credential revocation. Critics argue this stifles a free press and potentially exposes reporters to prosecution for seeking unapproved information, even if unclassified. The Association also voiced concern over plans to relocate news organizations' workspaces, fearing reduced access to sources. The Pentagon maintains it has negotiated in good faith and that access is a privilege, not a right.</p>

          <p>Mark Calcagni, the 60-year-old general manager of San Francisco's legendary Condor Club, was fatally shot multiple times outside his Santa Rosa home, with police actively searching for a suspect and motive. The Condor Club, which bills itself as America's oldest topless bar and is famously known as the site of the infamous 1983 "death by piano" incident, expressed profound shock and sorrow over Calcagni's sudden passing. His death adds another tragic chapter to the club's colorful six-decade history, which includes a landmark obscenity trial in 1965. Calcagni was instrumental in preserving the club's legacy, helping it become San Francisco's first adult entertainment venue designated as a legacy business.</p>

An expert noted that theme park deaths are exceptionally rare, particularly on gentle rides like the Haunted Mansion, emphasizing the stringent safety inspection standards at major parks like Disney.

          <p>President Trump unveiled a 20-point plan for peace in Gaza, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which outlines an immediate ceasefire, hostage and prisoner exchanges, and a phased Israeli withdrawal. The plan proposes demilitarizing Gaza under independent monitors and establishing a "technocratic" Palestinian committee, overseen by a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, to govern the territory. It also calls for extensive aid and economic development. While offering a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood" as an aspiration, the plan notably sidelines the Palestinian Authority and grants amnesty to Hamas members who disarm, leaving many questions about its long-term viability and implementation.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing heightened anxiety as President Trump attempts to deploy the National Guard to quell protests outside an ICE facility, despite legal challenges. Trump's rhetoric, describing the city as "war-ravaged" and "burning to the ground," has been criticized by local business owners for damaging the city's image and economy. A federal judge initially blocked the deployment of Oregon and other states' National Guard troops, though an appeals court temporarily allowed Oregon troops to remain under federal control.

          <p>The Pacific Palisades community is struggling to find closure after federal officials determined an Uber driver, Jonathan Rinderknecht, intentionally started a fire on January 1st that later reignited as the devastating Palisades fire. Residents were further traumatized to learn fire crews initially thought the blaze was extinguished, only for winds to revive it days later, destroying thousands of homes. While some residents expressed relief at identifying an arsonist, others questioned why the fire was not fully contained initially. The community faces a slow and challenging recovery, with many still mired in reconstruction efforts and some feeling that authorities' findings offer little true solace.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist investigates satellite images of his childhood village in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, discovering a new, well-used road leading directly to his old home. Given the village's proximity to the front lines and the flight of many residents, he suspects Russian soldiers have likely repurposed the vacant property as a military base. The article describes the transformation of Verkhnya Krynytsya from a peaceful village to a "zone of fear," where the Kakhovka reservoir, a cherished local landmark, has been destroyed. This personal account highlights the profound and often intimate impact of the ongoing conflict on individual lives and communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly stated that Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for opposing his efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. Trump continued to describe Chicago and Portland as "war-ravaged," intensifying his militarized campaign against "blue cities" and threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807. Both Pritzker and Johnson condemned Trump's remarks as "unhinged" and "wannabe dictator" behavior, with legal battles ongoing in federal courts regarding the legality of these deployments.

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner lauded defender Maya Le Tissier as a "rock" after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut, fueling debate over her potential inclusion in England's starting lineup. Despite her consistent performance as a central defender, making a record 71 consecutive WSL appearances and leading United's defense, Le Tissier has only eight international caps. With injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze, many believe the 23-year-old's exceptional form and versatility warrant a greater role for the Lionesses. Skinner expressed confidence in her ability, stating she will be an "incredible England stalwart" when given the opportunity.</p>

          <p>Britain's membership in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) has become a contentious political issue, with the Conservative Party pledging to withdraw if they win the next election. This stance, aimed at curbing illegal immigration, is opposed by Liberal Democrats and nuanced by Labour, highlighting deep divisions. The article traces the ECHR's politicization back to a 2011 dispute over prisoner voting rights and a misreported immigration case, which fueled public skepticism. Critics argue the ECHR overreaches, citing a climate change ruling, while human rights lawyers warn of lost protections. The debate underscores the complex interplay between sovereignty, human rights, and immigration policy.</p>

He cited geopolitical instability, fiscal spending, and global remilitarization as significant factors contributing to an atmosphere of high uncertainty. While acknowledging AI's long-term potential, Dimon cautioned that much of the current investment in AI could be lost, echoing the Bank of England's warning about "stretched" tech valuations. He also discussed the US becoming a "less reliable" global partner but noted positive developments in US-India trade talks, suggesting a deal to reduce tariffs is close. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article criticizes the growing trend of American politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Trump, using excessive profanity in public, arguing it diminishes the impact of swearing and undermines political decorum. The author, a self-proclaimed lover of swearing, contends that politicians' attempts to appear "edgy" or "authentic" through crude language often fall flat and are "wince-inducing." The piece suggests that while cultural norms around language have indeed become more tolerant, politics should remain a noble calling where leaders model appropriate behavior and set standards for the public. It calls for a return to more sophisticated public discourse, rather than politicians mimicking reality TV.</p>

Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader trade discussions, including U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations due to environmental concerns, was abandoned by its owner, TC Energy, after permits were canceled. While the conversation was preliminary, both leaders instructed their teams to continue discussions, signaling a potential new push for the controversial pipeline, despite past setbacks and ongoing opposition.</p>
