          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since September 2024, though the decrease was less severe than economists had anticipated. This downturn follows a 2% gain in April and comes after the Bank of Japan cautioned about a potential moderation in the country's growth due to trade-related factors. The decline in exports has already impacted Japan's GDP, which contracted by 0.2% in the quarter ending March. Amidst these economic concerns, trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S. remain unresolved, with Japan facing potential tariff increases if a deal is not reached by July 9.

          <p>China is leading the world in repurposing decommissioned coal mines into solar power projects, a trend that could boost the clean energy transition and alleviate a surplus of solar panels from Chinese manufacturers. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), 90 former coal mines in mainland China are now operating as solar-power facilities, with an additional 46 projects in the planning stages. This initiative offers a way to restore land, create local jobs, and deploy clean energy, with other countries like Australia, the US, and Greece also exploring similar conversion projects.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was released after being arrested for allegedly assaulting an immigration official. Some critics, like former New York City councilman Joe Borelli, suggest the arrest was a "staged event" to gain publicity before the upcoming election. Lander accused the Trump administration of stripping immigrants of their due process rights and thanked fellow mayoral candidates for protesting his arrest. Republican leaders condemned Lander's actions, with one consultant calling it another instance of a New York City progressive supporting lawbreakers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted a brief suspension of immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing ICE to resume targeted worksite enforcement operations. This reversal comes shortly after concerns arose that the crackdown on illegal immigration was unsettling foreign-born workers in these industries. Despite acknowledging the reliance of these sectors on immigrant labor, the administration has reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability through worksite enforcement. ICE arrests have been increasing, though they remain below the daily arrest rate sought by the White House.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passports. The ruling allows individuals renewing passports or changing their name or sex designation to choose their identified gender, including selecting "X" on the application form. This decision expands upon an earlier ruling in April and addresses a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which claimed the policy was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals.

          <p>The Justice Department has lost 4,000 employees due to the Trump administration's government downsizing initiative, raising concerns about the impact on community safety. The "fork in the road" deferred resignation program has saved an estimated $470 million, with further reductions planned, including 1,500 positions in the FBI. Critics argue these cuts are draining the department of experienced agents and leaders, potentially diminishing investigative capacity and undermining long-term effectiveness. Plans also include shuttering the Community Relations Service, an office founded during the civil rights era to address racial and ethnic tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," a remark that contrasts with previous U.S. statements indicating a lack of direct involvement in Israel's offensive against Iran. He also claimed that Iranian air defenses are inferior to American technology. The statement raises questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the conflict. The White House has not provided additional information about the president's comments, but Vice President Vance suggested further action to end Iranian uranium enrichment may be necessary.</p>
