          <p>A Georgia police officer has resigned after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented college student, Ximena Arias Cristobal, which led to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The officer pulled over Arias Cristobal for an improper turn and driving without a license, but dashcam footage later revealed the mistake, leading to the dismissal of charges. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE custody after an immigration judge granted her bond, while her father, also detained by ICE, was similarly released. Both still face deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was wrongfully deported to Mexico despite his fears of persecution, later being returned to Guatemala. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala and presented evidence of being sexually assaulted in Mexico. Judge Murphy criticized the deportation process as lacking due process, highlighting the man's constant fear and hiding since being returned to Guatemala. The ruling adds to a series of court findings against the Trump administration's deportation practices, emphasizing the need to uphold due process.</p>

          <p>More than a century after its sinking, unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a WWI-era submarine lost off the coast of San Diego, have been captured. The USS F-1 collided with another submarine in 1917, resulting in the loss of 19 crew members. Using advanced deep-sea imaging technology, including the submersible Alvin and remote underwater vehicle Sentry, a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted detailed surveys of the wreck. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed nearby in 1950, and held a remembrance ceremony for the lost crew members.</p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral and bypassing the U.N., was conceived and largely developed by Israelis aiming to undermine Hamas's control. The plan involves private contractors, including a security group run by a former CIA officer, distributing aid in Israeli-controlled zones, replacing the U.N.-run system. Israeli officials hope to prevent aid from falling into militant hands and avoid reliance on the U.N., which they accuse of anti-Israeli bias. U.N. officials warn the plan could restrict aid access, endanger civilians, and facilitate displacement from northern Gaza.</p>

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who has faced imprisonment and filmmaking bans in his home country, spoke out against the regime's restrictions after winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for "It Was Just an Accident". Panahi urged Iranians to set aside differences and prioritize their country's freedom, emphasizing that no one should dictate their choices. The film, shot in secret, draws from Panahi's prison experiences and tells the story of five Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them. Despite the risks, Panahi vowed to return to Tehran and continue filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's win at Cannes for "It Was Just an Accident" is a victory for a courageous filmmaker who has suffered for his art and spoken truth to power. The film explores political oppression in Iranian life with subtlety and depth. Panahi, who faced imprisonment and a filmmaking ban, has created a rich body of work that tells the world about Iranian society. The film tells the tale of five ordinary Iranians who are confronted with a man they believed tortured them in jail. The characters were inspired by conversations he had with other prisoners and "stories that they told me about, the violence and the brutality of the Iranian government", the director added.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel easing its blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza after 11 weeks, aid agencies warn that the limited number of trucks allowed in is insufficient to prevent famine. Although hundreds of trucks are ready with supplies, they face delays due to security checks, logistical problems, and ongoing conflict. The UN criticizes Israel's plan to use private security firms for aid distribution, arguing that existing networks are more effective. With the population heavily reliant on aid, the risk of famine looms if the influx of supplies remains inadequate.</p>

The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order. The U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely "lacked any semblance of due process."
