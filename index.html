        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a victory over Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping bout at Madison Square Garden. The fight was decided by a majority decision, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and the third scoring it a 95-95 draw. Unlike their previous encounters, this match was more of a tactical chess match than an all-out war, with Taylor's economical and smart boxing earning her a clear victory. Following the fight, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the historic rivalry but remained non-committal about her future in the sport.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is currently experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30°C (86°F) across large parts of the country. The hottest conditions are anticipated in the Midlands and south Wales, while amber heat health alerts remain active for several regions in England. The extreme heat has impacted events like the Wimbledon tennis tournament, where play was halted due to spectators needing medical attention. Fire chiefs have issued warnings about the increased risk of wildfires and drowning, while National Rail has cautioned about potential travel disruptions due to the heat's effect on infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A protracted eight-year legal battle has emerged between the owner of a multi-million pound penthouse on London's Park Lane and companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family. The dispute, which began over a lift installation, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched renovations, and the malicious use of a noisy lift at night. The article notes this combative legal approach was characteristic of Al Fayed. It also briefly refers to previous BBC reporting on allegations that Fayed sexually assaulted multiple women at a neighboring building he owned, with the conflict reflecting a continuation of his empire's contentious style.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants in a hard-fought game. Despite a late-game offensive surge that saw them score seven runs and chase Giants ace Logan Webb, the Dodgers could not overcome an early six-run deficit. The losing streak is the team's longest since 2017. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs in under five innings. While the team showed signs of life at the plate, their inability to prevent runs and capitalize on key opportunities in the final innings sealed another frustrating defeat, shrinking their division lead.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Israeli government's plan to forcibly move Palestinians into a contained encampment in Rafah amounts to the creation of a concentration camp. The author contends that this proposal, which would prevent inhabitants from leaving, is a brazen declaration of a policy that constitutes a crime against humanity. The piece reflects on the historical context of Palestinian dispossession and the repeated failures of international law to protect them. It concludes that despite the ineffectiveness of legal frameworks, the resilience of the Palestinian people and the eventual emergence of truth will ultimately hold Israel accountable.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, reinforcing its position as a major European military power. This acquisition is part of a larger 2022 agreement that will see Poland's arsenal grow by nearly 1,000 tanks, partly to replace Soviet-era vehicles sent to Ukraine. The deal highlights South Korea's growing role as a key arms supplier to U.S. allies, especially as conflicts deplete Western stockpiles. Poland's significant defense spending increase reflects its strategic position on NATO's eastern flank as Russia's war in Ukraine continues.</p>

          <p>Negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal are reportedly on the brink of collapse. Palestinian officials familiar with the talks claim Israel has deliberately stalled the process, sending a delegation with no real authority to decide on key issues like the withdrawal of troops and aid distribution. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel showing its intent to maintain deep buffer zones inside Gaza, contradicting earlier proposals. This perceived bad-faith maneuver has eroded trust and left mediators struggling to bridge the significant divides between the two sides.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the growing and uneasy alliance between influential figures in the U.S. tech sector and the 'Make America Great Again' political movement. Chinese analysts observe that this alignment, which includes deepening ties between tech firms and the defense industry, could lead to a more assertive and interventionist U.S. foreign policy, particularly towards China. While many of Trump's tech supporters advocate for continued pressure to contain China's technological development, some experts believe internal tensions within this coalition could ultimately undermine its political influence. The trend suggests a potential shift from tech leaders' traditional avoidance of foreign entanglements.</p>

The ruling, part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, prohibits federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like their apparent race, accent, or presence at specific locations. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found a "mountain of evidence" suggesting constitutional rights were being violated.

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous former drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to multiple charges, including drug conspiracy and leading a continuing criminal enterprise.

          <p>Numerous independent gift and toy shops across the UK have been left confused and financially hurt after the popular soft toy company Jellycat abruptly terminated their supply agreements. Shop owners who had stocked the brand for years, some for over two decades, received emails stating the decision was final and part of a 'brand elevation strategy.' The move comes after Jellycat's popularity exploded on social media, leading to stock shortages for small retailers. Many feel the company is prioritizing larger department stores, abandoning the independent shops that helped build its brand from the beginning, sparking a backlash from loyal customers.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the historic Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague has drawn significant criticism from architects, heritage experts, and the public. The 123-year-old steel bridge is an iconic part of the city's skyline, but authorities argue it is corroded and cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic. They propose replacing it with a new, three-track bridge and moving the old structure to a new location. However, a coalition of experts, endorsed by Unesco, argues the bridge can and should be repaired in place, preserving its historic panorama while saving money and minimizing disruption.</p>

Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the widespread layoffs will severely undermine U.S. diplomatic capabilities and national security.

The resort, which leader Kim Jong Un hailed as a world-class destination, was reportedly built using "shock brigades" of laborers under harsh conditions, raising concerns from human rights groups about forced labor. BBC Verify analysis of satellite imagery and planning documents shows a rapid, large-scale construction effort that mimics aspects of Spanish resorts like Benidorm. The opening is seen as an effort to boost North Korea's sanctioned economy and strengthen its ties with Russia, though experts are skeptical of its mass appeal to tourists.</p>

          <p>An intense and unusually early marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea has scientists deeply concerned about its impact on marine life. In late June and early July, sea surface temperatures regularly surpassed 30°C (86°F), reaching six to seven degrees above normal in some areas. This prolonged, extreme heat can be devastating for species like foundational seaweeds and seagrasses, causing mass mortality events and threatening the entire food web, which could impact fish stocks. Scientists identify global warming as the primary driver, noting the Mediterranean is a climate change hotspot particularly vulnerable to such extreme events.</p>
