          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that would have required congressional approval for further military action against Iran. The measure failed with a 53-47 vote, falling short of the simple majority needed to invoke the War Powers Resolution. In a related development, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that recent strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities did not cause a significant radioactive release, though several sites were damaged. President Trump also stated his belief that Iran had no time to move its nuclear materials before the strikes.</p>

          <p>British authorities have seized 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port, a haul with an estimated street value of Â£96 million. The drugs were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. According to the UK's Home Office, this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the country. The bust highlights the ongoing efforts by the UK Border Force to combat large-scale drug smuggling operations, as cocaine-related deaths have been on the rise.</p>

Over 1,000 people were reportedly killed in the conflict, which saw Israel target Iran's nuclear program and military infrastructure.

          <p>One year after President Biden's widely criticized debate performance against Donald Trump, the Democratic party is depicted as still grappling with its direction and leadership. The article suggests the event marked the start of a "spiral," leading to Trump's victory and ongoing internal fractures within the party. The recent primary victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor's race is used as an example of the current divides between the progressive wing and the establishment. The author argues the party remains rudderless and must look to its next generation of leaders to move forward.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is set to halt data collection from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) by June 30, a move scientists warn could severely hamper hurricane forecasting capabilities. The DMSP satellites provide crucial data for seeing inside developing storms and monitoring polar sea ice, and researchers state there is no adequate replacement. This abrupt termination, announced with little notice, has sparked alarm among forecasters and climate scientists, who fear it will blind them to critical weather developments during what is expected to be an active hurricane season. The decision is seen by some as part of a broader, systematic weakening of scientific programs.</p>

Bacon has recently been critical of the Trump administration on issues like military information leaks, job cuts, and tariffs, stating he would rather defend traditional conservative values than be a team player for a party going in the wrong direction.</p>

The analysis comes after Iran's defense minister called for a greater Chinese role in de-escalating the conflict at a meeting in Qingdao. The expert believes the conflict is unlikely to become a broader war, but tit-for-tat exchanges may continue as Iran pursues its nuclear ambitions.</p>

Following recent U.S. strikes on Iran, panelists noted that Gabbard appears to be aligning intelligence statements with the president's political preferences, a move that professionals typically avoid. This behavior is seen as a dangerous departure from the objective conduct of intelligence and contradicts Gabbard's own stated goal of rooting out such politicization.

          <p>Dr. Amy Acton, who served as Ohio's health director during the COVID-19 pandemic, has announced her candidacy for governor, setting up a potential race against likely GOP nominee Vivek Ramaswamy. Acton gained a national profile for her role in Ohio's early pandemic response but also faced intense backlash and protests over public health orders. Her campaign will test how voters now view the pandemic's handling, as she faces a political landscape transformed by Donald Trump and a rival who has labeled her an "Anthony Fauci knockoff." The race is framed as a significant indicator of the country's post-pandemic political mood.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump concluded the week in a triumphant mood, highlighting several significant achievements at home and abroad. He pointed to the successful U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities and the subsequent ceasefire with Israel as a major foreign policy win. Additionally, he celebrated NATO allies committing to increased defense spending and a Supreme Court ruling that curbs judges' power to block his executive orders nationwide. Trump also took credit for brokering a peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, framing the week as a series of tremendous successes for his administration.</p>

          <p>A petroleum analyst predicts that U.S. gas prices will continue a slow decline over the summer, potentially offering the lowest prices since 2021. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy suggests the national average could fall below $3 a gallon by September. A recent spike in oil prices due to the Israel-Iran conflict is expected to be temporary, with prices resuming their downward trend. Factors contributing to the expected drop include increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks, alongside a year-over-year price decrease of 12%.

The reviewer praises the film for its fidelity to the sport's technical intricacies while grounding the plot in a familiar but effective character-driven drama.

          <p>Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu basking in a perceived military victory over Iran, his political standing at home remains precarious. Polling suggests that his popularity has not seen a significant "bounce" and that a majority of Israelis want the war in Gaza to end in exchange for hostages. Many believe he is prolonging the conflict for his own political survival. Netanyahu also faces ongoing legal challenges, with a high-profile corruption trial set to resume, which President Trump has unhelpfully suggested should be canceled.

          <p>A series of decisive military actions against Iran and its proxies has allowed Israel to reassert its military dominance and reshape the Middle East's strategic landscape. Following conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah that weakened the Iran-backed groups, Israel's recent 12-day air campaign successfully targeted Iran's nuclear and military sites. Analysts note that Iran's "axis of resistance" has been severely damaged, leaving Israel as the region's dominant military force. However, these military successes have not resolved underlying political issues, particularly the Palestinian conflict, and have tarnished Israel's international reputation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

The author argues that the incident, regardless of its full truth, highlights a climate of shredded free speech rights and a crackdown on dissent.

          <p>With summer heat waves sweeping the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the dangers of leaving children in hot vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from heatstroke in cars, with five of those deaths occurring in June. Experts emphasize that a vehicle's internal temperature can rise by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature increases three to five times faster than an adult's. Advocates urge parents and caregivers to establish routines, such as leaving a personal item in the backseat, to avoid tragically forgetting a child.</p>
