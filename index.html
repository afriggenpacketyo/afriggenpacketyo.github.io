        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting it was not an error but a justified action due to Garcia's alleged ties to the MS-13 gang, which the administration considers a terrorist organization. This claim is disputed by Garcia's attorneys, who deny his gang affiliation and note his lack of a criminal record. The deportation has sparked international attention, with El Salvador's president refusing to return Garcia to the U.S., and a federal judge ordering the Trump administration to provide updates on efforts to facilitate his return.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist, Zheng Yongnian, cautioned Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) against siding too closely with the United States in the ongoing trade war with China. Zheng suggests that aligning with the U.S. could lead to isolation from China and hinder ASEAN's growth prospects, as the U.S.'s re-industrialization efforts primarily aim to bring manufacturing back to America, whereas China is better positioned to assist ASEAN in achieving its industrialization goals. He emphasized the importance of carefully managing economic and trade relations with China to avoid potential challenges.</p>

          <p>An angry mob in Santa Ana, California, mistakenly targeted the wrong house after the release of an accused serial cat killer, Alejandro Oliveros Acosta. The vigil for the slain cats turned violent when attendees, believing they had located Acosta's brother, surrounded the house, broke windows, and pepper-sprayed the resident, who is actually related to Acosta's brother-in-law but claims to have had no contact with him since the arrest. Police have condemned the violence and vandalism, declaring it an unlawful assembly, and are investigating the incident. The victim and his family, including seven children, expressed fear and shock at the mob's actions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party is projected to win Canada's snap election, although without a majority, according to CBC and CTV News. The election was overshadowed by U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed calls for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, which were widely rejected by both Carney and his Conservative challenger Pierre Poilievre. The election outcome marks a comeback for the Liberals after a period of declining popularity following Justin Trudeau's resignation, with Trump's intervention potentially hurting the Conservatives due to a backlash from Canadian voters.</p>

          <p>The Filipino community in Vancouver is mourning the 11 people killed when a driver rammed his SUV into a crowd during a festival celebrating Lapu Lapu Day. The youngest victim was a 5-year-old girl who died alongside her parents, while a school guidance counselor was also among the deceased. Authorities have stated that the motive for the attack did not appear to be terrorism, and the suspect, a 30-year-old man with a history of mental illness, has been charged with murder. Prime Minister Mark Carney visited the site to pay his respects.</p>

          <p>China's Tsinghua University has successfully recruited Alex Lamb, a prominent American artificial intelligence (AI) researcher from Microsoft Research, to join its College of AI. This recruitment highlights the increasing competition between China and the U.S. for top AI talent, particularly as Washington intensifies measures to restrict funding and exports to China. Lamb's move underscores China's efforts to bolster its AI capabilities by attracting leading scholars from around the world. The United States has become concerned that China may be attempting to steal or otherwise pilfer American intellectual property.</p>

China has a robust toolbox at its disposal for this purpose. It includes a range of fiscal and monetary policies, with fiscal policy taking the lead. A 10 trillion yuan (US$1.3 trillion) debt swap plan was announced to help local governments deal with hidden debt, contributing to transparent debt management. The measure reduces interest rates by around 2.5 percentage points, potentially saving 600 billion yuan within five years.</p>

          <p>President Trump has decided to provide relief to automakers by easing some tariff restrictions, allowing importers of foreign auto parts to receive reimbursement for tariffs for the next two years. This move aims to reward domestic manufacturers while providing a "runway" for those needing time to invest in domestic plants, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The decision follows the implementation of 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imported cars and car parts, which had drawn complaints from automakers despite praise from the United Auto Workers.</p>
