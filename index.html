            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that companies are unlikely to reshore production to the U.S. due to high costs associated with Trump's tariffs, with 57% citing cost as the primary deterrent. Instead, 61% of respondents indicated a preference for relocating supply chains to lower-tariffed countries. The survey also highlighted concerns about inconsistent strategies from the Trump administration and the potential for increased automation over human labor if manufacturing returns to the U.S. The findings suggest that tariffs may not achieve the intended goal of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>

            <h2>UK-US Trade Deal Hinges on Specific Details and Reciprocal Tariffs</h2>

            <p>This article analyzes the potential for a UK-US trade deal, noting the recent positive comments from US Vice-President JD Vance and UK business minister Sarah Jones. It questions the scope of the "deal," suggesting it may focus on science, technology, and AI cooperation rather than a comprehensive free trade agreement. The article highlights the challenge of the US's 10% tariff on UK imports, part of its "reciprocal tariffs," which could complicate negotiations. It suggests that making an exception for the UK would invite significant trade diversion.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has declined to accept conditions set by the Trump administration for continued federal funding, citing the need to protect its independence and constitutional rights. In response, the administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard. The conditions included leadership reforms, halting DEI policies, and an audit of viewpoint diversity. Harvard's president stated that while the school has taken steps to address antisemitism, it would not accept an agreement that exceeds the federal government's power.</p>

            <p>Treasury yields experienced a period of relative stability on Tuesday after a week of volatility driven by concerns over Trump's tariff policies. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly, while the 2-year Treasury yield added less than 1 basis point. The recent sell-offs in the bond market raised questions about who is letting go of Treasurys, with concerns about Chinese and Japanese investors potentially reducing their holdings. Debt concerns and hedge fund selling may have also contributed to the volatility.</p>

            <p>A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S. is unable to replace its rare earth element supply from China, posing a threat to its defense capabilities. China's export controls on rare earth elements used in defense, energy, and automotive technologies could disrupt supply to U.S. firms. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable due to its reliance on China for heavy rare earths processing, which are crucial for advanced defense technologies. The report emphasizes the need for long-term efforts to develop domestic mining and processing capabilities.</p>
