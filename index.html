        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks and engage in a second round of negotiations, the Trump administration is taking a more hands-off approach, signaling a subtle shift in its mediation efforts. While President Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress, the administration has not taken concrete steps to impose new sanctions on Moscow despite previous threats. Ukraine has launched coordinated drone strikes on multiple Russian airfields, while Russia has deployed a record number of drones and missiles against Ukraine. Despite the ongoing conflict, both countries participated in negotiations, though no major breakthroughs were achieved, and Zelenskyy has requested stronger support from Trump. The situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to engage in attacks and negotiations simultaneously.</p>

          <p>The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has claimed responsibility for a new attack on Russia's Kerch Strait Bridge, alleging that underwater supports were mined, causing significant damage. This incident occurred shortly after Ukraine conducted drone strikes on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Meanwhile, Russia continued its long-range attacks on multiple Ukrainian cities, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries. Despite these attacks, Ukrainian and Russian representatives met for a second round of direct negotiations in Istanbul, with Ukraine demanding a full ceasefire and the release of prisoners. However, Russia has issued maximalist demands, including Ukrainian withdrawal from claimed regions and limitations on its armed forces, which Kyiv has rejected.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein and Emma Ashford discuss the Trump administration's foreign policy, particularly concerning Gaza and Ukraine. Klein notes a shift in focus towards domestic issues and a changing American position on international conflicts. Initially, Trump seemed disinterested in Gaza and aligned with Putin on Ukraine, but his "America First" foreign policy has been evolving. Ashford provides a realist perspective, acknowledging some merit in Trump's foreign policy impulses, leading to a discussion on the administration's actions and their potential effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance. The search is focused on 21 plots of land between the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine disappeared, and where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, had been staying. BrÃ¼ckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate crime, the sexual assault of an elderly American tourist in Portugal. Investigators are hoping to find enough evidence to charge BrÃ¼ckner with Madeleine's murder before his potential release.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S., with GDP growth sliding to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, primarily due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. The OECD notes that these tariffs have increased the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938, leading to higher consumer costs and a projected inflation spike to 3.9% by the end of 2025. The report also warns of downside risks, including policy uncertainty and financial market corrections, and forecasts a slowdown in world economic growth to 2.9% this year and next year. The OECD suggests the rise in trade barriers and economic policy uncertainty will negatively impact business and consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>Fashion brand The North Face and luxury jeweler Cartier have both reported customer data breaches in recent cyber attacks. The North Face experienced a "small-scale" attack where hackers stole customer names, email addresses, and potentially shipping addresses and purchase histories using a technique called "credential stuffing." Cartier reported an unauthorized party gained temporary access to their system, obtaining limited client information, but not passwords or card details. Both brands have taken steps to enhance their system protections and have reported the incidents to relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>Constellation Energy's shares rallied after Meta signed a 20-year agreement to purchase nuclear power from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. Meta will buy approximately 1.1 gigawatts of energy, the entire output of the site's nuclear reactor, starting in June 2027. The agreement will support the plant's continued operation and relicensing, expanding Clinton's output by 30 megawatts. This deal aligns with Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity and supports the growing trend of tech companies partnering with the nuclear industry.</p>

Thames Water, serving a quarter of the UK's population, faces challenges including huge debts, leaks, sewage spills, and outdated infrastructure. The company is now pursuing an alternative plan with its lenders, but the politicization of the water industry is seen as a major disincentive for investors.</p>

Opponents argue that the hunt is a trophy hunt driven by bloodlust and not based on scientific conservation principles. They claim that the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) is using outdated data to justify the hunt and that it would reintroduce barbaric practices such as bear baiting and chasing with dogs. Concerns are also raised about the lack of adequate protections for bears and the potential for illegal baiting, as seen in the 2015 hunt.</p>
