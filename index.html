          <p>After a two-week walkout to stall Republican-led legislation, Texas House Democrats have returned to the state capital, allowing the legislative session to resume. Their return paves the way for Republicans to advance redrawn congressional maps, which Democrats argue are discriminatory and designed to unfairly increase the GOP's advantage in future elections. The Democratic caucus has stated their return is intended to build a legal case against the proposed maps, signaling that the fight over redistricting will likely move from the statehouse to the courts. The move has national implications, as both parties vie for control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>George Foreman, the iconic boxer who won the heavyweight title twice and later found immense success as an entrepreneur, has died. Foreman first became champion in 1973 before losing the title to Muhammad Ali in the legendary "Rumble in the Jungle" match. After a religious experience, he retired from boxing to become a minister but mounted an improbable comeback, reclaiming the heavyweight championship in 1994 at age 45. Following his second retirement, he became a household name once again by endorsing the wildly popular George Foreman Grill, cementing his legacy as a beloved cultural figure.</p>

          <p>James Lovell, a decorated NASA astronaut who flew to space four times and famously commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away. Lovell was one of the first humans to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8 in 1968, a mission that captured the world's imagination. His calm and decisive leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, when an explosion crippled the spacecraft, was instrumental in the safe return of his crew, turning a potential tragedy into one of NASA's most celebrated triumphs. His iconic message, "Houston, we've had a problem," remains a symbol of grace under extreme pressure.</p>

In his later years, he became a beloved television personality through the reality show "The Osbournes," which offered an unfiltered look at his family life. Despite battling numerous health issues, including Parkinson's disease, he remained a towering figure in rock music until his final days.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the Americas, has passed away, leaving a legacy of significant change within the Catholic Church. Known for his humble lifestyle and choice of name honoring a saint who lived in poverty, he shifted the Vatican's focus towards social justice, environmentalism, and a more welcoming stance on controversial topics. His papacy was marked by efforts to address the climate crisis, critique global financial systems, and foster a more inclusive church. While his progressive direction rejuvenated many followers, it also drew criticism from conservative factions, highlighting the transformative and often contentious nature of his leadership.</p>

The group alleges that the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project is engaging in biased advocacy by hosting seminars to educate judges on climate litigation, potentially shaping judicial outcomes in favor of environmental plaintiffs. The letter to the Attorney General cites documents suggesting coordination between judges and expert witnesses aligned with climate activists. The Environmental Law Institute maintains its programs are non-partisan and provide objective, evidence-based training for judges on complex scientific topics.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that the amount of money to place in a certificate of deposit (CD) depends heavily on an individual's overall financial situation, liquidity needs, and the current interest rate environment. While CDs currently offer solid returns, savers should first ensure they have a robust emergency fund before locking money away. With the Federal Reserve expected to lower rates, locking in a higher CD rate now could be advantageous. Strategies like CD laddering, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, can help balance the need for returns with access to cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military government has announced that the first phase of a general election will be held in late December, marking the first such poll since the 2021 coup that overthrew the democratically elected government. The election is widely viewed by opposition groups and international observers as an attempt by the junta to create a facade of legitimacy amid an ongoing civil war. With large swaths of the country in active conflict and the party of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi banned from participating, the credibility of the election is heavily disputed.</p>

          <p>In a significant step for advanced nuclear energy, Google and startup Kairos Power will collaborate with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to deploy a new reactor by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, will provide up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free electricity to the TVA grid, helping to power Google's regional data centers. This project is notable as Kairos and Google will bear the financial risk of building the first-of-a-kind plant, a model designed to accelerate the adoption of new nuclear technologies without placing the initial cost burden on consumers.</p>

This settlement is the latest major payout by a media organization for its 2020 election coverage, following Dominion's landmark $787 million settlement with Fox News.

          <p>A jury has found Javon Riley guilty for his role in a gang-related shooting in Dalston, London, that severely injured a nine-year-old girl. The child was an innocent bystander eating at a restaurant with her family when she was struck in the head by a bullet from a passing motorbike, leaving her with a bullet lodged in her brain. The court heard that Riley conducted reconnaissance for the attack, which targeted three men affiliated with a rival gang. The gunman remains at large, but Riley was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and the attempted murder of the three intended targets.</p>

The reversal was triggered by broader macroeconomic concerns, including higher-than-expected inflation data that dampened hopes for a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. This shift in sentiment led to a wave of forced liquidations totaling over $500 million across the market, as traders who had bet on rising prices were forced to sell their positions, accelerating the price decline for Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets.

          <p>A large-scale study conducted in rural Kenya has found that unconditional cash transfers can be a powerful tool for saving infant lives. Researchers discovered that infants born to families who received a one-time payment of $1,000 were nearly 50% less likely to die compared to those in a control group. The study suggests the money enabled families to afford better healthcare, particularly during childbirth, and improved nutrition. The findings indicate that direct cash aid can be as effective as some traditional medical interventions, offering a simple yet potent method for improving child survival in low-income regions.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that the only plausible path to ending the war in Ukraine is through a significant, long-term military buildup that convinces Russia it cannot achieve further gains on the battlefield. This perspective argues that diplomatic efforts, including discussions of territorial concessions and security guarantees, are unlikely to succeed unless Ukraine is armed to a level that can credibly deter future aggression. The article posits that any potential peace deal hinges on creating a military reality where the costs of continuing the war become unsustainable for Moscow, thereby forcing a genuine negotiation for a sovereign and secure Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The debate over potential territorial concessions in the Russia-Ukraine war is heavily focused on the eastern Donbas region, comprising Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia is reportedly demanding full control of these areas, which hold significant industrial resources and form a land bridge to Crimea. For Ukraine, ceding this territory would mean abandoning its most fortified defensive line, known as the "fortress belt." Both nations face constitutional hurdles to any formal territorial changes, with Ukraine's constitution declaring its borders indivisible and Russia's having been amended to incorporate the annexed regions, creating a deep-seated impasse in peace talks.</p>
