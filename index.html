          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. According to sources, she was dismissed under Article 2 of the Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey was a prominent figure in the Southern District of New York, having led prosecutions against Sean "Diddy" Combs and having been involved in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Her father, James Comey, was terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations. The decline is attributed to weakening shipments to major partners like China and the U.S., with auto exports to the U.S. plunging significantly. The situation is exacerbated by a 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports, raising concerns that the export-reliant economy could enter a technical recession. Carmakers appear to be absorbing the tariff costs by cutting prices to maintain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting violent criminals, newly obtained ICE data reveals that a small fraction of those deported had convictions for the most serious offenses. Of the roughly 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, with many infractions relating to traffic or immigration offenses. The data indicates that assault convictions accounted for about 15% of cases, while known or suspected gang members or terrorists made up just over 3%.</p>

The discussions have focused on expanding Chinese market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff reductions. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic effort by Beijing to find common ground and strengthen economic ties amid its ongoing trade tensions with the United States.

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant negative market impacts if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A research note from Wolfe Research anticipates an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, describing the potential scenario as "a mess." The move would likely trigger a legal battle, potentially reaching the Supreme Court, over whether the president has the authority to fire a Fed chair for cause. The uncertainty surrounding Powell's tenure and the independence of the central bank is a major concern for economic stability.</p>

The business owner, who believed he was complying with the law by using the system, is now considered a victim by federal agents, as the investigation targeted identity theft, not the employer. Experts argue that E-Verify is easily fooled because it vets documents, not people, making it a "wink-and-nod" system that fails to prevent the use of stolen identities. This vulnerability exposes both employers and identity theft victims to harm.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued from a remote California forest after she strategically left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became lost after their GPS led them onto remote roads in the Stanislaus National Forest, where they lost their signal. The notes, along with the son's use of a whistle and help from a ham radio operator who relayed an emergency alert, guided the search-and-rescue team to their location. Authorities praised the mother's preparedness and clear thinking in a difficult situation.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for terminating a key federal disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit targets the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which funds projects to protect against natural disasters. The states argue that the administration acted unlawfully, as the power to terminate a congressionally funded program rests with Congress. The cuts are seen as threatening vital infrastructure projects and increasing the risk of harm from future disasters.</p>

          <p>An $8 billion class-action lawsuit brought by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders has gone to trial. The lawsuit alleges that the company failed to disclose the risks of user data misuse, stemming from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Shareholders claim that Meta violated a 2012 FTC consent decree by sharing user data without consent, leading to massive fines and legal costs. The trial, which is expected to include testimony from Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg, seeks to have the executives reimburse Meta for these financial losses.</p>

          <p>Key federal programs that provide companionship and support to socially isolated older adults could be at risk due to potential funding cuts from a new domestic spending bill passed under President Trump. Programs like the Senior Companion Program, which connects volunteers with elderly individuals living alone, rely on federal funding that could be slashed. Experts warn that losing these services would exacerbate health risks associated with loneliness, such as dementia and heart disease, and could lead to increased institutionalization and higher mortality rates among the elderly.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has called on the Trump administration to release all government files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. His position directly contrasts with that of President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a politically motivated "hoax." Pence emphasized that the names of victims should be protected in any disclosure but argued that the American people deserve the facts. This public disagreement highlights a significant split between the president and his former vice president on a matter of intense public interest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's rationale for clawing back nearly $8 billion in foreign aid, which it attributes to "waste, fraud and abuse," is facing significant scrutiny. Former and current officials, including the recently fired USAID inspector general, state that the administration has provided little to no proof for these claims. Critics allege the cuts are politically motivated, targeting programs related to gender, climate, and family planning, rather than being based on effectiveness. The controversy raises questions about the transparency and motivation behind the drastic dismantling of U.S. foreign aid programs.</p>

Prices have increased significantly in some regions, driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options. The rising costs place a substantial financial burden on working families who rely on this care, with many struggling to pay the fees upfront. The situation is even more challenging for parents of children with special educational needs, for whom there is a severe lack of adequate provision.</p>

As insurance costs have risen since the Grenfell Tower fire, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly allowing freeholders to profit from the disaster.
