          <h2>Government Postpones Release of Child Poverty Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:36:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially expected in the spring, until later in the year, possibly aligning it with the autumn budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, continues its work, considering measures like scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Critics, including the SNP, have condemned the delay, while charities offer mixed reactions, some hoping for a more substantial strategy. A government spokesperson affirmed their commitment to tackling child poverty and highlighted existing measures, while Labour ministers cited resource constraints for not immediately lifting the two-child benefit cap.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are embracing the concept of 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay, marking a shift from previous generations' dedication to employers. A Mynavi Career Research Lab study reveals that nearly half of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, seeking more time for hobbies, travel, and personal pursuits. This change is attributed to witnessing their parents' sacrifices for companies and a desire to avoid 'karoshi,' or death by overwork, while companies are trying to cut costs. Sociologists suggest this shift could positively impact the economy and address the country's shrinking population by encouraging leisure spending and family formation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, but the victory came at a cost as their pitching staff faced unexpected hurdles. A rain delay shortened Clayton Kershaw's start, and the bullpen was stretched thin, with closer Tanner Scott blowing a three-run lead in the ninth. Despite these challenges, Teoscar Hernández's RBI double in the 13th inning propelled the Dodgers to victory, highlighting their resilience amidst a demanding schedule. The article emphasizes the potential future consequences for the Dodgers' pitching staff due to the heavy workload in this game.</p>

          <p>A former people smuggler detailed to the BBC how he used yachts to transport Vietnamese migrants into UK marinas, exploiting lax security.

The smuggler, motivated by financial desperation, shared his experiences to expose ongoing vulnerabilities in UK border security. Border Force acknowledges the risk, noting that private marinas lack adequate security, and that they are focused on small boat crossings, leaving other methods less monitored.</p>

The government is also exploring online sales and aims to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies. The average supermarket rice price reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg, nearly double last year's level, due to a poor harvest and increased demand from tourism.</p>

Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, argue that the use of live facial recognition is a dangerous escalation of surveillance power and poses a threat to fundamental rights.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the Black Hawk approached the Pentagon, leading air traffic controllers to redirect the commercial flights out of caution. The Army attributed the incident to a temporary antenna's location interfering with communication, while the FAA declined to comment due to an ongoing NTSB investigation. This incident has heightened concerns about air safety near Reagan National Airport following a fatal midair collision earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarkets are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestically grown rice, and other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The move reflects consumer interest in more affordable options as prices of Japanese rice have doubled due to a poor harvest and increased demand. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan called the sale of U.S.-grown rice 'historic' for American farmers.</p>

          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes on June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stockpile their preferred products, while retailers report a surge in sales. The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and prevent youth vaping, but some fear it will drive ex-smokers back to cigarettes and negatively impact small vape shops. Concerns are also raised about the potential for a black market and the change in taste from disposable to refillable vapes, with some users finding the latter less appealing. The government defends the ban as necessary for public health and environmental reasons.</p>
