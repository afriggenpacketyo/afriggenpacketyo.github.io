          <h2>Presidential Golfing History: A Look at Trump and His Predecessors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of golf in the White House, focusing on how various presidents, including Donald Trump, have utilized the sport. For Trump, golf is more than just a pastime; it's integrated into his business and political mindset, using the course for meetings and negotiations, which contrasts with predecessors like William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, who preferred to separate official duties from leisure. Dwight Eisenhower, despite facing criticism for his frequent play, installed putting greens at the White House and Camp David, while George W. Bush ceased golfing during the Iraq War to show solidarity with grieving families. The article highlights how golf has been both a source of relaxation and a subject of scrutiny for presidents over the past century. The history of golf and presidents is full of ironies, from presidents trying to avoid work on the course to having their golf game be the subject of jokes and ridicule. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs faces challenges in the aviation industry, where a shortage of skilled workers persists. The industry is grappling with an aging workforce, with many aircraft mechanics nearing retirement and companies having offered buyouts during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a significant loss of talent. To address this, airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people through competitive wages, with potential earnings reaching $130,000 a year for experienced technicians. Despite these efforts, the industry faces difficulties in attracting geographically mobile workers, especially as demand for air travel and airplane production increases. The need to attract and retain skilled workers is essential to ensure the continued growth and safety of the aviation sector.</p>

          <p>This article discusses Donald Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, framing it as a response to protests following immigration raids. However, the article suggests the move is also a message to Democratic-run cities that resist federal immigration policies, implying a form of retribution for opposing the administration's deportation efforts. This action raises concerns about federal overreach and the potential for escalating tensions between the federal government and local authorities. The deployment is viewed as a thinly veiled threat to cities that protect immigrants from deportation. The article's analysis suggests the move is less about restoring peace and more about exerting political pressure.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, stating that it will escalate tensions and that the federal government is attempting to take over the California National Guard.

          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum on potential changes to citizenship and labor laws, initiated by an NGO-led campaign. The referendum includes questions on reducing the residency time required for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 years to 5 years, which campaigners say would help integrate second-generation Italians. Voters will also decide on measures related to worker protections against dismissal, severance payments, and liability in workplace accidents. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain from voting, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout for the results to be binding.</p>

          <p>Tinder is testing a new feature allowing premium users to filter potential matches by height, sparking mixed reactions among daters. Some worry it may stifle connections, while others believe it could help shorter men find matches by avoiding women who only date tall men. Some users find height preferences to be superficial, while others find the feature to be helpful for finding compatible partners. Experts say the real issue with modern dating lies within the dating apps themselves, encouraging people to treat dating like picking something from a menu.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance," where institutions preemptively comply with Donald Trump's agenda, and argues for a counter-strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." Examples of anticipatory compliance include universities censoring course content and companies reducing DEI programs. The article highlights the historical dangers of such compliance, noting that it paves the road to autocracy, and praises the rise of anticipatory noncompliance, such as colleges pushing back against demands and states contesting the administration's interpretation of civil rights law. The author argues that restoring democracy requires a multi-faceted approach, including demonstrations, boycotts, litigation, and political organizing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed budget aims to slash Pell Grants, which could significantly limit college access for low-income students. These grants, considered the foundation for financial support, would be at their lowest level in over a decade, disproportionately affecting families with incomes below $60,000. Experts warn that these cuts could force millions of students to drop out or take on more debt, exacerbating the already rising cost of tuition. The Pell program functions like other entitlement programs, but unlike those programs, the Pell program does not rely solely on mandatory funding that is set in the federal budget. The cuts are seen as an extreme measure, especially as past shortfalls have been addressed with additional funding from Congress.</p>

The author argues that these acts of violence and hate make Jews feel less safe outside of Israel, reinforcing the need for a Jewish state. The historical context of Zionism is explored, emphasizing that it arose from the rejection and persecution of Jews in various societies. The author argues that a rational anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome and secure outside of Israel, but that such a movement does not currently exist.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information and providing support to women seeking to end their pregnancies. This movement began in the 1990s with the discovery of misoprostol, a drug that could be used to induce abortions safely outside of a medical setting. Activists established hotlines and accompaniment groups to provide information and support, helping women navigate legal restrictions and access safe abortion methods. These efforts led to significant legal changes, including the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, and demonstrated the effectiveness of self-managed abortion with proper support.</p>

          <p>Scotland has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's Callan McKenna to address a goalkeeping crisis ahead of their friendly match in Liechtenstein. Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie have left the squad due to injuries, leaving the team short on options. Coach Steve Clarke had previously expressed concern over the lack of goalkeeping options, and the team was forced to call up the two players. Doohan is reportedly set to return to Celtic, while McKenna has been training with the squad.</p>

          <p>At least 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down on their approach to Moscow, leading to temporary airport restrictions. The attack follows intensified long-range strikes by both sides, even as U.S.-brokered peace talks continue. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the urgent need to strengthen air defense capabilities in response to Russia's intensifying attacks on cities nationwide. Zelenskyy framed Russia's expanding attacks as proof that President Vladimir Putin is not genuine in his willingness to negotiate a peace deal, urging Western partners to increase pressure on Russia.</p>

Merz, along with other European leaders, had previously warned of sanctions if Russia did not agree to the ceasefire, but no action was taken when the deadline passed.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar spending package, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street due to its potential impact on foreign investment. The House-approved measure would allow the U.S. to impose a tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" against U.S. companies. Analysts warn that this "revenge tax" could have significant implications for the asset management industry and limit foreign investment in the U.S. The Investment Company Institute has cautioned that the provision could deter foreign investment, while experts are still assessing the potential effects as the Senate reviews the bill.

The court case was about whether the law should treat a person as an individual rather than as a member of a group. The court case was related to the question of whether justice demands that a nation and its institutions try to provide assistance to targeted groups to help increase diversity in employment and education and help targeted groups overcome the systemic effects of centuries of discrimination.</p>

The article discusses how a lawsuit against gun manufacturers, while unsuccessful, has raised awareness of the issue and prompted the U.S. to acknowledge its responsibility to clamp down on gun trafficking. The Trump administration's designation of Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations could lead to terrorism-related charges for weapons traffickers.

The article also notes that the Democrats seem to be stuck in election politics as usual. The article concludes that while self-reflection is necessary, the party should avoid excessive self-immolation and focus on presenting a strong opposition to the current administration.</p>

          <p>A near-shore earthquake could trigger a tsunami with devastating effects on California's coastal communities, with waves potentially arriving in as little as 10 minutes. Many communities lack sufficient evacuation plans, and a study identified nine densely populated areas with limited escape routes, making them particularly vulnerable. The potential for chaos and confusion during an evacuation was highlighted by a recent earthquake off the Humboldt County coast. Officials recommend that residents in vulnerable areas know evacuation routes, be prepared to shelter in place, and understand the potential risks in their communities, as hesitation can be deadly.</p>

Southern California could face significant casualties and over $1.4 billion in damage from a distant-source tsunami, with potential waves reaching 15 feet in some areas. Near-source tsunamis pose an even greater risk due to the limited warning time, with potential for 30-foot waves in Avalon on Catalina Island. The Central Coast and Bay Area also face substantial risks, with potential for casualties and billions in damage, emphasizing the need for preparedness and awareness. The North Coast, particularly Del Norte County, is highly vulnerable due to its proximity to the Cascadia subduction zone, with the potential for devastating waves and thousands of casualties.</p>
