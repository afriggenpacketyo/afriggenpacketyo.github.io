        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Silver futures surged to $36.27 per troy ounce, marking the highest price since early 2012, driven by the ongoing rally in gold and increased investor interest in precious metals. The price increase reflects a broader trend of investors seeking safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The rise in silver prices could impact various industries, including electronics, solar energy, and jewelry, where silver is a key component. The continued demand for silver as both an investment and an industrial metal suggests further price volatility in the near term, although this could be tempered by increased mining output.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a public spat after Musk criticized Trump's tax bill, leading Trump to suggest cutting government contracts for Musk's companies. Musk responded defiantly, even stating that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft immediately, although it is unlikely that he will actually decommission the Dragon spacecraft. The feud escalated with accusations and counter-accusations exchanged on social media, including Musk's unsubstantiated claim about Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. The clash highlights the growing tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration, potentially impacting future collaborations and policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Bin workers in Birmingham, represented by Unite, voted to continue their strike action potentially until December due to an ongoing dispute over pay and job security. The union asserts that 97% of voting members support continued strikes, highlighting the intensity of the disagreement with the Birmingham City Council. The council claims to have presented a fair offer and expresses commitment to resolving the dispute, but the union argues that the proposal was inadequate and came late. The strike, which began with on-and-off action in January and escalated in March, has led to significant waste accumulation and public health concerns in the city.</p>

          <p>ICE arrests have increased significantly under President Trump's second term, surpassing 100,000, as the agency intensifies efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants across the U.S. The increase reflects pressure from administration officials to conduct a minimum of 3,000 arrests daily, leading to more aggressive tactics, including arrests at courthouses and worksites. This shift marks a reversal of Biden-era policies that focused on serious criminals and national security threats. The expansion involves support from other federal agencies and has sparked outrage and confrontations in some communities, raising concerns about due process and human rights.</p>

          <p>David Brooks argues that the Democratic Party's challenges extend beyond leadership, requiring a fundamental adaptation to a new historical era marked by widespread social distrust. He suggests that the party's current leaders are too focused on fundraising and elections to address the deeper issues at play. Brooks points to the rise of global populism, driven by a sense that social systems are rigged, as a key factor. He contrasts the Republican Party's successful adjustment to this shift with the Democrats' struggle to find a compelling message, emphasizing the need for visionaries and a shift in worldview.</p>

          <p>Erick Romero Quintana, a street racing influencer, faces multiple charges for allegedly organizing illegal street takeovers via his Instagram account, @privatemeetz. The charges stem from incidents between December 2022 and November 2023, including one where a spectator died after being hit by a spinning car. Authorities are taking a novel approach by targeting individuals involved in organizing rather than just participating in the races. Quintana's attorney argues that his client merely announced the locations and did not participate in the events, while prosecutors emphasize the influencer's responsibility for the resulting crimes and chaos.</p>

          <p>Vox published an article examining President Donald Trump's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, including Wolff's recordings of Epstein discussing their relationship. The article highlights the pair's "bromance" from the 1990s, with salacious gossip and Trump's own statements about Epstein. The article underscores the many accusations of sexual misconduct that Trump himself has yet to really confront, and serves as a visceral reminder that the Epstein-Trump connection was real and well-documented. In the tapes, Epstein emphatically showed his distaste for his former friend, calling him “a horrible human being.”</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes Afghanistan, creating concerns for thousands awaiting U.S. resettlement, although Afghans who served with the U.S. during the war can still pursue a Special Immigrant Visa. The ban cites the threat of terrorism and visa overstay statistics as justification for the inclusion of Afghanistan. The decision raises questions about the fate of those who worked with the U.S. and now face potential danger under Taliban rule. Critics argue that the ban punishes Afghan allies and undermines promises of safety.</p>
