          <p>A review of a power outage at Heathrow Airport revealed that the chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, was asleep and unreachable when the airport was closed. The closure, caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation, affected 270,000 journeys. The report found that Woldbye was not involved in the decision to suspend operations and only became aware of the incident hours later. The review recommended that Heathrow implement a second means of contact for key personnel during critical incidents, despite concluding that the airport responded efficiently and smoothly. The incident cost airlines millions and stranded many passengers.</p>

          <p>Jeanine Pirro, formerly of Fox News, was sworn in as the interim U.S. attorney for D.C., marking another appointment of a Fox News personality by President Trump. Trump praised Pirro's dedication to justice and the rule of law during the Oval Office ceremony. Pirro's appointment followed controversy surrounding Trump's previous pick, Ed Martin, whose past defense of January 6 rioters faced strong opposition. Pirro's first major action was investigating the deadly shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers as a hate crime and act of terrorism, emphasizing that antisemitism would not be tolerated in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>UK prosecutors have authorized 21 charges against Andrew and Tristan Tate, including sexual assault, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking. The charges were authorized before an extradition warrant was issued in 2024 to bring the brothers back from Romania. The Tate brothers are currently under investigation in Romania, facing a number of charges which they deny. The Crown Prosecution Service stated that the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first, as the CPS's charging decision came after receiving a file of evidence from Bedfordshire Police about allegations made in the UK.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as automakers navigate regulatory uncertainty and varying consumer acceptance of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. This expansion comes as automakers seek to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations, with PHEVs acting as a potential steppingstone to all-electric vehicles. Toyota is working to increase the electric-only range of its PHEVs, balancing product strength and competition in the market.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently imprisoned for bank fraud and tax evasion. The couple was sentenced in 2022 after being convicted of submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing their income from the IRS. Trump stated that the couple received "pretty harsh treatment" based on what he's hearing, while the couple's daughter has been seeking a pardon for her parents, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status. The Justice Department previously stated that their sentences reflect the magnitude of their criminal scheme and should serve as a warning.</p>

          <p>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany would step up its support for Ukraine, increasing funding for the production of weapons, including long-range ones, and sending more military equipment to Kyiv. This commitment comes as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict, and Europe is forced to take a more prominent role. The German Defense Ministry detailed that the aid includes cooperation in weapons construction, air-defense systems, and financing of satellite communications, valued at roughly 5 billion euros. Zelensky's visit to Berlin underscores the chancellor's efforts to reestablish German leadership among European allies and the importance of Germany in sustaining the Ukrainian war effort.</p>

The judge emphasized O.C.G.'s constant fear and inability to rely on police protection in Guatemala. DHS responded that the asylum system was not intended as a "get-out-of-deportation-free card," while the judge's order came in response to a class action lawsuit challenging the deportation of immigrants to third countries without proper notice or opportunity to contest removal.</p>

          <p>An unsealed grand jury indictment revealed a scheme to trade cocaine for Syrian weapons, involving drug cartels, rebel groups, and rogue regimes across four continents. Hundreds of kilos of cocaine were set to arrive at a Syrian port in exchange for weapons from the arsenal of Syriaâ€™s deposed dictator, intended to arm the National Liberation Army in Colombia. Antoine Kassis, a Lebanese national, appeared in court after being extradited from Kenya, accused of involvement in a narco-terrorism conspiracy. The case highlights concerns that the military arsenal of Bashar al-Assad could fall into criminal hands, with Kassis allegedly having ties to members of the Assad regime and a global money laundering network.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO stands out because existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. Circle plans to sell 9.6 million shares, while existing shareholders will sell 14.4 million shares, a rare occurrence in tech IPOs. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where 57% of shares were sold by existing stakeholders, though Circle's figure is even higher at 60%. One reason for the high insider sales is the prolonged period of meager returns for venture capital firms after the market peaked in 2021, leading to a need for liquidity among Silicon Valley's tech investors.

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons of reality TV stars and a sheriff convicted of bribery highlight a pattern of granting clemency to political allies and those he believes were unfairly targeted. These pardons, along with dropped public corruption cases, signal a de-emphasis on such cases within the Justice Department. Critics argue that Trump is undermining efforts to hold officials accountable, while those seeking pardons often claim political persecution. The appointment of a staunch Trump ally as pardon attorney and a "pardon czar" further raises concerns about the politicization of the pardon process.</p>

          <p>President Trump's foreign policy prioritizes economic agreements with allies while showing less interest in diplomacy with rivals, particularly in resolving conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas fighting. He focuses on business deals and investments with wealthy Middle Eastern states, emphasizing commerce over conflict resolution. Analysts note that Trump's approach is more successful with allies who share similar interests but struggles with genuine conflicts of interest. His administration's reliance on dealmaking and skepticism of U.S. overreach may keep the U.S. out of major entanglements but could also lead to missed opportunities for influential roles in global hotspots.</p>

The Israeli initiative aims to bypass both the UN and Hamas, but aid groups argue it is inadequate. The Israeli-designed system involves four aid sites secured by Israeli soldiers and overseen by private U.S. contractors. UN officials have boycotted the program, citing violations of humanitarian principles, replacing hundreds of UN distribution sites with just four, requiring Palestinians to travel miles through Israeli troops for aid.</p>

          <p>Porsche faces significant challenges due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, impacting its business amid existing issues with declining Chinese sales and slumping demand for electric vehicles. The 25% tariff on imported cars to the United States, followed by the threat of a 50% tariff for all products from the European Union, has led Porsche to scale back its forecast for the year. Unlike competitors with U.S. manufacturing, Porsche produces its vehicles exclusively in Germany, making it more vulnerable. The company is now bringing back models with combustion engines and expanding its offering of plug-in hybrid vehicles, abandoning planned investments in battery technology.

Expired medications may become less potent or contaminated with bacteria, posing potential health risks. It's important to store medications in a cool, dry place, away from children and pets. Proper disposal methods include using medication take-back locations or mixing medications with coffee grounds or kitty litter before discarding them in household garbage. It's also advised to have a well-stocked first aid kit with essential supplies and back-up medications for chronic conditions.</p>
