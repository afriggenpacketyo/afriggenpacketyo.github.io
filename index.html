        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris examines the modern phenomenon of being prompted to tip for services with minimal human interaction, such as at self-service kiosks. He reflects on the internal conflict of feeling like a "cheapskate" for not selecting the highest tip option, even when the service rendered is minimal. Sedaris wryly connects this experience to his own family's immigrant background and the evolving social pressures surrounding gratuities in everyday transactions.</p>

          <p>This literary analysis explores the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic writer often overshadows her significance as a major religious author. A convert to Catholicism, Spark's fiction is deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job, and explores themes of divine will and human fallibility. The article suggests her narrative style, characterized by authorial omniscience and irony, mimics the relationship between an unknowable God and humanity, making her a unique figure in modern British literature.</p>

The article discusses how this archetype, from Macbeth's weird sisters to modern tales, often serves as a test for other characters and embodies societal fears of femininity and the unnatural. While acknowledging the risk of cliché, the analysis suggests that these stories remain compelling because they reflect enduring anxieties about womanhood, persecution, and the power of collective identity.</p>

          <h2>Trail Cameras Confirm Southern Migration of Black Bears in Michigan</h2>

          <p>Researchers at Michigan State University have confirmed the presence of black bears farther south in Michigan than traditionally expected, with trail cameras capturing images of the animals in the Lansing swamp area. This southern migration is attributed to a growing bear population in the state's Lower Peninsula. While the return of a native species is seen as ecologically positive, wildlife officials are advising residents in these new areas on how to coexist peacefully by securing food sources.</p>

A video of her panicked reaction as she tries to coax the animal out of the room went viral on TikTok. The incident serves as a lighthearted reminder of the increasing encounters between humans and wildlife, and the importance of respecting animals' space even when they appear friendly.</p>

          <p>The severe floods that recently hit Texas have led to an unexpected prehistoric discovery: 110-million-year-old dinosaur footprints. A volunteer assisting with cleanup efforts found the tracks, believed to have been made by a large carnivore similar to an Acrocanthosaurus, along the Sandy Creek. The floodwaters washed away layers of dirt and debris that had concealed the prints, revealing a glimpse into the region's ancient past as paleontologists work to document and preserve the site.</p>

While politically popular and seen as a money-saving tool for families, tax experts argue the benefits are often overstated. Critics suggest these holidays primarily cause consumers to shift the timing of their purchases and that wealthier shoppers, who have more spending flexibility, are best positioned to take advantage of the breaks.</p>

          <p>This article explores why humans are so drawn to negative news, explaining the concept of "negativity bias" — an evolutionary trait that makes us more attentive to threats. It argues that while the media often focuses on problems, this psychological quirk amplifies feelings of doomscrolling and anxiety. The author suggests that consciously seeking out stories of progress is a necessary antidote to foster realistic optimism and inspire action on the world's solvable problems.</p>
