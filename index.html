          <p>Princess Kate Middleton shared a rare, affectionate birthday tribute to Prince William, featuring a never-before-seen photo of him with their black cocker spaniel, Orla, and her four puppies.

The post follows Princess Kate's withdrawal from the Royal Ascot as she continues her cancer treatment. The tribute is a departure from the couple's usual practice of avoiding personal messages on social media, highlighting the significance of the occasion and Kate's ongoing recovery.

          <p>The Israel-Iran war has entered its second week with continued strikes targeting an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan. Iran's foreign minister warned against U.S. military intervention, stating it would be dangerous for everyone.

The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens were lightly wounded in an Iranian missile strike. President Trump is considering U.S. military involvement, setting a two-week timeframe for a decision while Iranian officials express openness to dialogue but not during continued Israeli attacks.

          <p>Casinos in Las Vegas are laying off dealers due to a decline in tourism and the increasing use of automation. Visitor volume in Las Vegas has decreased for three consecutive months, leading to lower gaming revenue and hotel occupancy. The introduction of electronic table games and broader economic uncertainty contribute to the job cuts. Nevada's unemployment rate has risen, and analysts link the tourism decline to evolving U.S. travel policies and economic concerns. Upcoming projects could potentially draw fresh crowds, but the city's tourism may continue to struggle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palestinian rights activist Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, has been reunited with his family after being held by ICE for over three months. He arrived in New Jersey after a federal judge ruled his detention unconstitutional. The Trump administration had targeted Khalil for his criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and criticized the attempt to punish his speech. The release marks a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students.</p>
