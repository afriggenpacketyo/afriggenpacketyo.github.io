          <p>Residents in Spain's Galicia region have won a landmark legal case against regional authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The court found that nitrate runoff from massive amounts of livestock waste had contaminated drinking water, destroyed local ecosystems, and violated the citizens' fundamental human rights. This ruling, the first of its kind in Europe, orders compensation for the claimants and mandates a cleanup, setting a potential precedent for similar environmental justice cases across the continent. The case may advance to the European Court of Human Rights, which could compel systemic reforms at a national level.</p>

          <p>Opening statements are underway in the trial of Ryan Routh, who is accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Palm Beach golf course in 2024. Prosecutors allege Routh had a detailed plan, including acquiring a military-grade rifle and using burner phones, before being spotted by the Secret Service. Routh, who is representing himself in court after dismissing his lawyers, faces multiple criminal counts that could result in a life sentence. The trial revisits a high-profile instance of political violence from the final weeks of the 2024 election campaign.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has dismissed its ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, following the release of new documents detailing his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prime Minister Keir Starmer requested the dismissal after emails showed Mandelson referring to Epstein as his "best pal" and suggesting his initial conviction was wrongful. The Foreign Office stated that this new information revealed a relationship "materially different" from what was known at the time of his appointment, leading to his immediate withdrawal from the diplomatic post.</p>

          <p>British Olympic swimmer Ben Proud has announced he is joining the Enhanced Games, a controversial event that permits the use of performance-enhancing drugs under medical supervision. Proud stated that the prize money from a single race could surpass what he would earn from winning 13 World Championship titles, highlighting the financial unsustainability of traditional Olympic sports for many athletes. His decision has been condemned by governing bodies like Aquatics GB and UK Anti-Doping, which cited concerns over athlete health and fair play.

          <p>In a significant ruling for gender equality, South Africa's highest court has overturned a law that barred husbands from adopting their wives' surnames. The Constitutional Court declared the existing legislation unconstitutional, stating that it amounted to gender-based discrimination. The case was brought by two couples who were denied the right for the husband to either take his wife's name or create a hyphenated surname. Parliament has been instructed to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's landmark decision.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ethical complexities raised by the Shrimp Welfare Project, an organization focused on improving the well-being of the hundreds of billions of shrimp farmed for food annually. The issue serves as a real-world test for philosophical concepts like "scope sensitivity"—the idea that the sheer number of individuals affected should dictate moral priority. While some critics dismiss the focus on shrimp as absurd, proponents argue that if one accepts that animals can suffer, the immense scale of shrimp farming makes it a significant moral concern.

In a concession to environmental advocates, the bill also imposes stricter safety and regulatory requirements on offshore pipelines, making new coastal drilling more difficult. The proposal seeks to balance economic stability with the state's long-term climate goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Critic Bill Addison reviews 88 Club, the new Beverly Hills restaurant from "Top Chef" winner Mei Lin, finding moments of excellence alongside dishes that feel underdeveloped. The prawn toast is highlighted as a standout creation, a perfectly executed reinvention of a classic snack. However, the review notes that much of the broader menu, which explores various regional Chinese and Chinese American cuisines, lacks a strong, singular vision and often settles for being merely pleasant. While some dishes are persuasive, the overall experience doesn't yet match the high expectations set by Lin's previous acclaimed projects.</p>

          <p>The hobby of "junk journaling," a creative practice combining scrapbooking and collage with found objects like receipts and ticket stubs, is surging in popularity. In Los Angeles, the Junk Journal Club has become a key social hub, turning a solitary pastime into a communal event where crafters can connect and make friends. For many members, the club provides a welcome alternative to typical social scenes and has helped combat the loneliness often felt in a large city.

          <p>This contributor piece argues that the Trump administration, despite campaigning on ending "forever wars," has launched two new ones: a military-led war on drugs in the Caribbean and a symbolic war on crime in American cities. The author claims these actions are a misuse of military assets and distract from more significant geopolitical threats, such as China's rising power. The article criticizes the deployment of military personnel for drug interdiction and urban policing as ineffective and costly. It concludes that these new domestic "wars" are unwinnable and degrade military readiness for actual national security challenges.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that Congressional Democrats should use their leverage in the Senate to force a government shutdown rather than vote to fund an administration they view as lawless. The author contends that while shutdowns are typically against the Democratic brand, the current political climate requires a drastic stand against policies that are already harming vulnerable Americans. The piece suggests Democrats should outline clear demands, such as restoring healthcare funding, and be prepared to vote no if Republicans refuse to negotiate. A temporary shutdown, the author concludes, would be a worthwhile price to pay.</p>

          <p>Ghost, a giant Pacific octopus at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, is entering senescence, the final phase of her life cycle. She has laid a clutch of unfertilized eggs and will now devote the remainder of her days to caring for them, forgoing food and her own needs, a natural behavior for her species. Aquarium officials explained that this process occurs in the wild and that they do not pair octopuses for mating due to their aggressive nature. The announcement of the beloved creature's approaching end has prompted an outpouring of affection from the community.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have successfully verified a key theory about black holes proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing gravitational waves from a recent collision of two black holes, researchers confirmed Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. The combined surface area of the two initial black holes was smaller than the area of the single black hole they formed after merging. This observational proof, made possible by significant upgrades to LIGO detectors, marks a major milestone in astrophysics.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Israel's extensive campaign of targeted killings against leaders of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iranian military officials across the Middle East since 2023. High-profile assassinations in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Gaza have eliminated key figures like Hamas's Mohammed Deif and Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah. While some of these strikes, particularly in Lebanon, contributed to a cessation of hostilities, others in Gaza and Yemen have failed to end ongoing conflicts. The campaign demonstrates Israel's long-reach capabilities but also raises questions about the long-term effectiveness of assassination as a tool for achieving lasting security.</p>
