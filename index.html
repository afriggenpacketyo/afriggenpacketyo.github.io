Built in 1842, the church was adorned with fresco murals in the 1950s by Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture artists. The artists recreated biblical scenes within the building, which now serves as a community gathering and performance space.

            <p>Former Trump administration 'Border Czar' Tom Homan defended the decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite court orders to facilitate his return to the U.S. Homan claims Abrego Garcia is a violent MS-13 gang member, a charge disputed by Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family. Homan criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, accusing him of neglecting victims of MS-13 in his own state. The Supreme Court had unanimously ordered the administration to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's return for a trial, but Homan argues the administration lacks the authority to do so.</p>

            <p>Humberto Duran, an East L.A. man, was declared factually innocent of a 1993 murder after serving nearly three decades in prison. The key eyewitness recanted her testimony, claiming she was pressured by sheriff's deputies to falsely identify Duran. Duran's lawyers presented evidence that he was framed and had an alibi. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office conceded that there was evidence of 'actual innocence.' Duran is now eligible to seek compensation for his wrongful imprisonment.</p>

            <p>Gary Shapley was removed as interim IRS commissioner just two days after his appointment, following an internal struggle involving Elon Musk. Musk reportedly backed Shapley for the position, bypassing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority. Bessent complained to President Trump and supported the appointment of Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender as the new acting head. Shapley, known for speaking out about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax probe, will continue serving as an advisor to Secretary Bessent.</p>

            <p>Despite court orders to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Trump administration maintains he will not be allowed back. The White House is using the case to emphasize its tough stance on immigration and criticize Democrats. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele allowed Senator Chris Van Hollen to meet with Abrego Garcia, later posting images of the meeting with sarcastic commentary. Democrats are now in a politically challenging position defending due process for an individual with alleged gang ties.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the use of dark humor as a coping mechanism in the face of political repression and authoritarianism. It draws historical examples from Franco's Spain, Communist East Germany, and present-day situations. The article explores how authoritarian leaders also utilize humor for their political purposes. The author suggests that macabre jokes might be particularly appealing during times of repression, especially among highly educated individuals.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, citing a failure to act in the public interest. Legal experts say that such a move would have a significant financial impact on Harvard. History shows that revoking a university's tax-exempt status is a long and difficult process. A similar case involving Bob Jones University in the 1980s serves as a potential legal precedent.</p>
