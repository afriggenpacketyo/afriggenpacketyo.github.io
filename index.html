        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to begin taking steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, according to Tokyo. This development follows a period of strained relations and import restrictions. Further details regarding the specific steps and timeline for the resumption of imports were not immediately available in the article, but the agreement signifies a potential thaw in trade relations between the two countries, with potential positive implications for the Japanese seafood industry. The resumption of trade could also ease some of the economic pressures faced by Japanese fishermen and seafood producers who have been impacted by the import ban, which had been in place for an unspecified period prior to this agreement. The agreement marks a significant step towards normalizing trade relations and fostering economic cooperation between China and Japan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite sanctions imposed by Ukraine's allies, Russia continues to generate substantial revenue from fossil fuel exports, effectively funding its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Data indicates that the West has paid Russia significantly more for hydrocarbons than it has provided in aid to Ukraine. Loopholes, such as the "refining loophole" where Russian oil is processed in third countries and then sold to sanctioning nations, further exacerbate the issue. While the EU has a roadmap to end Russian gas imports by 2027, some member states fear energy price escalations, leading to continued reliance on Russian fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film 'Sinners' in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set. The screening was organized following a community petition, as Clarksdale lacks a movie theater. Coogler expressed his connection to Mississippi, noting his family's roots in the state and how working on the script changed him. The film, a supernatural vampire flick set in 1930s Clarksdale, was well-received by the local audience, who appreciated the homage to Mississippi Delta culture, and the event included a Q&A session with Coogler and other members of the cast and crew.</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. anticipates that new tariffs could negatively impact its business by $100 million to $150 million if they remain in effect, causing shares to plummet. The company is working to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain and reducing its reliance on China. CEO Richard Dickson stated that Gap plans to increase cotton purchases from the U.S. to further offset the tariff impact. Despite the tariff concerns, Gap's first-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded expectations, driven by strong performances from Old Navy and the Gap brand, the latter seeing sales of $724 million, up 5% compared to last year.</p>

Despite concerns about tariffs potentially raising consumer prices, Costco is actively seeking ways to mitigate these costs, such as rerouting goods and sourcing more private-label items domestically. The company's strategy of offering competitive prices and bulk discounts, along with discounted gas and groceries, continues to attract customers and drive membership renewals.

          <p>President Donald Trump has implemented a series of tariffs on goods from other countries, arguing they will boost American manufacturing and protect jobs. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, and Trump aims to reduce the trade deficit by encouraging consumers to buy American-made products. However, a US trade court ruled that Trump did not have the authority to impose the sweeping import taxes, and the move has thrown the world economy into chaos, although a day later an appeals court allowed the tariffs to stay in place while the case is litigated. Critics argue that tariffs will make products more expensive for US consumers.</p>
