          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK's defence spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2034, a target underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This review, scheduled for release on Monday, will outline military and security spending priorities for the coming years, assuming the 3% target is met. The review will address emerging threats like drones and AI, recommending the deployment of digital experts alongside troops, while also warning of immediate dangers posed by Russia, and describing China as a persistent challenge. The OBR estimates meeting the 3% target would require an additional Â£17.3 billion in 2029-30. </p>

          <p>Five people have died in Assam, India, due to landslides triggered by torrential monsoon rains, leading to a red alert for 12 districts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against a Kansas law that nullifies advance medical directives for pregnant women regarding end-of-life treatment. Three women and two physicians are challenging the law's constitutionality, arguing it violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The plaintiffs claim the law denies pregnant women the option to make advance directives to accept or refuse healthcare if incapacitated or terminally ill. The physicians argue the law forces them to provide a lower standard of care to pregnant patients, potentially leading to legal repercussions. </p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has warned of an "imminent" threat posed by China to Taiwan and urged Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth characterized China as a hegemonic power seeking to dominate Asia and highlighted a potential 2027 deadline for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. Hegseth emphasized that any attempt by China to conquer Taiwan by force would have devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific region and the world. The Shangri-la Dialogue traditionally serves as a platform for the US and China to vie for influence in Asia. </p>

The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have launched a joint campaign to investigate and eliminate illegal and harmful information related to the exams. Mock papers and private tutors are reportedly using AI as a gimmick to attract students and parents, selling simulated test questions at inflated prices.

          <p>After 23 years of construction and congestion, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a Â£2 billion upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce travel times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's benefits, critics cite the project's extensive delays and high cost. </p>

          <p>BBC Sport has launched a new interactive game called UEFA Champions League Squares, where participants answer trivia questions to earn edit tokens for their gamecard. These tokens can be used to make changes like marking squares as correct, flipping teams, or swapping squares for randomly selected tiles. Points are scored in various ways, with extra time considered in knockout stages but not penalty shootouts. The game provides a fun and engaging way to follow Champions League matches. </p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the weekend series against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe, sustained at home. Despite the injury, Betts and manager Dave Roberts are optimistic he will avoid the injured list, expecting him to be day-to-day based on pain tolerance. In Betts' absence, Miguel Rojas will take over at shortstop, with Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim as other options. Betts, who has been struggling at the plate recently, had started in each of the Dodgersâ€™ past 20 games. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attempts to impose sweeping tariffs have encountered legal setbacks and economic resistance, undermining his initial claims that "tariffs are easy." A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a potential Supreme Court battle. While Trump aims to raise revenue, cut taxes, and boost domestic manufacturing, his tariff threats have often been followed by delays and exemptions. Panic in the markets and warnings about the impact on voters have prompted him to backtrack on several occasions. </p>

          <p>Following a knife attack in Hamburg, conflicting accounts and manipulated images have flooded social media, casting doubt on reports of heroism by a Syrian teenager named Muhammad al-Muhammad. Altered images have been used to express scorn, disbelief, and uncertainty about the facts, discrediting media accounts. Experts warn that such disinformation undermines democracy and fosters a climate of uncertainty. Despite police confirming al-Muhammad's involvement, the spread of false images has fueled conspiratorial narratives and eroded trust in media and authorities. </p>

While Lula defended Silva after the senate incident, his support for projects like oil drilling contradicts his promise of zero deforestation by 2030.
