          <p>President Trump has expressed interest in taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors holding shares in the firms. However, critics like Senator Elizabeth Warren warn it could destabilize the mortgage market and raise housing prices. The White House states it is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency while carefully evaluating any actions, and TD Cowen expects a slow and deliberate approach to any changes in the enterprises.

          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement its first-ever checked bag fee of $35 for the first bag and $45 for the second, effective for flights booked on or after May 28.

These changes come amid pressure from activist investors to improve the airline's financial performance.

          <p>A new NASA study reveals the Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the past 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead. Groundwater is disappearing 2.4 times faster than surface water, primarily due to overpumping for agriculture. The study highlights the urgent need for better groundwater management, especially in states like Arizona, where regulation is limited. The climate crisis is expected to exacerbate the region's water shortages.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem advocated for Karol Nawrocki to be Poland's president at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Warsaw. Noem criticized his opponent as a "train wreck" and attacked "weak" European leaders for allowing in migrants. She praised Trump and said Poland would have US backing if they elected a leader who would work with him. This is an unusual move for a sitting member of the U.S. Cabinet to advocate for a political candidate in a foreign country.</p>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, up to Â£1,000 each, and may have debts written off, due to the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are disbursing more than Â£70m in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem. The regulator found that suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement. The Â£1,000 payments are for customers who faced "inappropriate installation."</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have incentivized fraud as companies seek to evade them. Some U.S. firms report receiving solicitations offering ways to avoid tariffs, which often involve customs fraud, costing the U.S. government billions in revenue. These schemes include undervaluing goods and misclassifying items. Some companies have been unfairly disadvantaged by competitors willing to cheat.

          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record number of puffins, totaling 43,626, despite global populations of the seabird declining. The increase is attributed to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island. The tiny island is an internationally important seabird island managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW). Skomer also hosts 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have passed a bill making it easier for parents to opt out of vaccinating their children, despite an ongoing measles outbreak in West Texas. HB 1586 would allow parents to download and fill out a form from the state health department website to claim vaccine exemptions. Democrats argue the bill could lessen immunity, especially during the outbreak, while Republicans claim it simplifies the process and saves money.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is narrowing its check-in window for U.S. flights, requiring passengers to check in 45 minutes before departure, effective June 3. This aligns with the deadline for passengers checking luggage and is 15 minutes earlier than the previous cutoff for those with only carry-on bags. Other major U.S. carriers have also adjusted their check-in and boarding policies to improve on-time departures.</p>
