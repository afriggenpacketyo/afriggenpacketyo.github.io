          <p>Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, currently classified as a Category 1 storm. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate it will intensify into a major hurricane, potentially reaching Category 4 strength early next week. While not expected to directly impact the United States, its path is being closely monitored, and tropical storm watches have been issued for several Caribbean islands in the northern Leewards. The storm's formation aligns with NOAA's prediction for an above-normal season, which typically peaks between mid-August and mid-October.</p>

          <p>Shares of Applied Materials fell over 13% after the semiconductor equipment manufacturer issued a weaker-than-expected financial forecast, citing uncertainty and reduced demand from its business in China. The company's guidance for the upcoming quarter projects revenue and earnings below analysts' estimates, reflecting a slowdown after a period of rapid manufacturing expansion in the region. Despite beating estimates for the previous quarter, the cautious outlook led Bank of America to downgrade the stock. The guidance also assumes a significant backlog and does not account for pending export license applications. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding the peak summer travel season less predictably profitable as demand patterns shift, with some travelers flying earlier in the season or moving European trips to the fall. In response to an initial oversupply of capacity that drove down fares, carriers have reduced their August schedules, which is now expected to increase ticket prices. This adjustment comes as airlines grapple with higher labor costs and unpredictable booking behaviors, where consumers wait until the last minute to purchase flights. Several major U.S. airlines have lowered their 2025 profit forecasts, reflecting the challenges of navigating these new travel trends.</p>

The new league, which attracted top names with promises of high prize money, has been unable to pay millions in appearance fees and winnings after promised investment failed to materialize. The financial crisis led to the cancellation of its season finale in Los Angeles. Johnson stated that clearing these debts is his top priority and that systems are being put in place to prevent future financial breakdowns.</p>

          <p>Country singer Luke Bryan has strongly condemned the practice of throwing objects at artists during performances, calling the perpetrators "idiots" and describing it as a "deterioration of the moral fabric." His comments follow an incident at the North Dakota State Fair where he was hit in the face with a small beach ball-like object while on stage.

          <p>Widespread online rumors claiming that the U.S. government is distributing new stimulus checks to taxpayers are false, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Congress has not passed any legislation authorizing such payments, and no new economic impact payments are scheduled for distribution. The confusion may stem from a separate, expired deadline for claiming a 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit or a proposed bill by Senator Josh Hawley, which has not passed. The IRS has clarified that past stimulus payments were authorized by specific acts of Congress in response to economic crises, and no such authorization is currently in place.</p>

          <p>The United States has positioned two B-2 stealth bombers at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska just before President Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The deployment of these long-range bombers, which can carry both conventional and nuclear munitions, is widely seen as a symbolic display of American military power. The high-stakes meeting is focused on seeking a ceasefire in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The presence of the B-2 bombers, the same type used in a recent operation against Iran's nuclear sites, underscores the serious geopolitical context of the diplomatic talks.</p>

          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is reviewed as a worthy modern Western that explores the lives of a struggling ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter in South Dakota. Directed by Kate Beecroft, the movie employs a docu-fiction approach, casting first-time actors to play versions of themselves in a story drawn from their own experiences with horses, family, and financial hardship. While the review notes that the film doesn't achieve the seamless transcendence of similar works like "The Rider," it praises the authentic portrayal of resilience and the compelling performances of its real-life subjects, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga.</p>

          <p>An analysis of crime statistics reveals that President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force is based on misleading claims. While D.C. did have a high murder rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024. According to the city's Metropolitan Police Department, violent crime has seen a 26% reduction this year compared to the same period in 2024, continuing a downward trend. This data contradicts the administration's narrative of a current, escalating crisis and aligns with a broader national trend of decreasing crime rates reported by the FBI.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument posits that government support is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The potential deal, which could utilize funds from the CHIPS Act, aims to bolster domestic high-end technology production. The move is framed as a strategic necessity to ensure the U.S. maintains control over critical technology, especially in light of the rise of superintelligent AI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, particularly her most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." It explores Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her focus on the moral education of young people under the influence of a charismatic, god-like teacher. The story centers on the recollections of Brodie's students, especially Sandy, whose journey into adulthood and conversion to Catholicism is framed as a way of dethroning her former mentor. The analysis highlights Spark's realistic portrayal of how influential figures can leave an indelible mark on a person's life, even long after their direct influence has waned.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, this analysis outlines the divergent goals of Russia and Ukraine, with Kyiv watching anxiously from the sidelines. Experts suggest Vladimir Putin aims to secure a halt to U.S. financial support for Ukraine, legitimize territorial gains, and potentially drive a wedge between the U.S. and its European allies. Conversely, Ukraine seeks a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from its territory and has rejected any notion of ceding land. The summit is considered high-risk, as President Trump's desire for a peace deal could be exploited by Putin to achieve a "bad peace" that ultimately leads to more conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen a significant shift in foreign policy decision-making, moving away from the traditional National Security Council process to a small, core group of trusted loyalists. This inner circle, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, now shapes major decisions on issues like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. The change reflects Trump's mistrust of the larger NSC bureaucracy and his increased confidence in his own instincts, leading to a more personalized and centralized approach. While this allows for more nimble action, critics warn it increases the risk of unintended consequences by limiting expert input and diverse viewpoints.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military reports it has successfully attacked the Russian port of Olya in the Caspian Sea, sinking a cargo vessel named Port Olya-4. Ukrainian officials claim the ship was being used to transport drone components and ammunition from Iran to Russia for use in the war. This marks the first known Ukrainian strike on a vessel in the Caspian Sea, extending its operational reach into a new area. The attack appears to be a targeted effort to disrupt Russia's supply chain for Shahed-type drones, a critical component of its long-range strike capabilities against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has completed the signing of 18-year-old center-back Giovanni Leoni from Italian club Parma for a reported fee of £26 million. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the Premier League champions until 2031. Leoni, who only made his senior debut in 2023, is seen as a strategic signing to provide defensive cover and build for the future, especially with captain Virgil van Dijk now 34. Despite his limited top-flight experience, Leoni's impressive aerial ability and composure in possession attracted interest from several top clubs before he opted for the move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., is suing the federal government in an attempt to block its takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration has illegally asserted control and is abusing its limited authority under the Home Rule Act. The legal action follows an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi appointing the head of the DEA as the city's "emergency police commissioner," a move that D.C. officials say would unlawfully upend the MPD's command structure. Mayor Muriel Bowser has called the federal intervention, which includes deploying National Guard troops, an "authoritarian push" without a justifiable emergency.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate has introduced a joint resolution to end President Trump's federalization of the Washington, D.C. police force. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, the resolution asserts that the president has not demonstrated the "special conditions of an emergency" required to justify such a takeover. The sponsors, including Representative Jamie Raskin and Senator Chris Van Hollen, argue the move is an egregious attack on the city's autonomy. They contend that the president's actions are based on a misleading narrative about crime and have actually harmed public safety by disrupting the police command and city funding.</p>

The club stated that of the 17 players available for the cancelled game, only two had recent Super League experience.

The news, combined with disclosures of new stakes by investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, has provided a significant boost to the company's stock.

          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 4.0, but such events are common in this volcanically active area, home to a major geothermal power facility. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, these minor quakes are often induced by the power generation process itself. This involves the withdrawal of steam and the injection of reclaimed cold water, which can cause the surrounding rock to contract and shift, triggering small seismic events that are not related to major fault lines like the San Andreas.</p>

Military analysts report that Russian troops have breached Ukrainian defensive lines east of Dobropillia, creating a dangerous moment for Kyiv's forces. This battlefield development is seen as a strategic move by the Kremlin to create leverage for the negotiations in Alaska, potentially allowing Putin to argue that the war is turning in his favor.

The administration argues against such broad injunctions on law enforcement, while civil rights advocates point to evidence of unconstitutional targeting.

The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit vacates a lower court's injunction that had blocked the mass firings. The administration aims for a "more streamlined" bureau, but critics and the employees' union argue the cuts would make it impossible for the CFPB to perform its congressionally mandated duties to protect consumers. The ruling is a significant step in the administration's effort to dismantle the agency created after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
