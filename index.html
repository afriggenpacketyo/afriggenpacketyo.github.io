          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. The decision came after Slovakia received guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, addressing its primary concerns. The country had previously held up the package, which requires unanimous approval from all 27 member states, over a separate EU plan to halt Russian gas imports by 2028. EU ambassadors are now expected to formally approve the new sanctions.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of residential burglary for the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The couple was found in their Encino home days after they were killed upon returning from a grocery store. The suspect, Raymond Boodarian, was identified using security camera footage and facial recognition technology. His arraignment has been postponed, and he is being held without bail as the district attorney considers whether to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has recommended a single-day prison sentence for Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights. Hankison blindly fired ten shots into Taylor's apartment during the fatal 2020 raid, though none of his bullets struck anyone. The sentencing memo also requests credit for time served, meaning he would face no additional jail time if the judge agrees. This recommendation marks a significant reversal from the administration and has drawn criticism amid ongoing debates about police accountability.</p>

          <p>A House vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package, targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, has been stalled due to internal Republican divisions. The delay is caused by controversy surrounding the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with some members attempting to attach amendments forcing their disclosure. The legislation, requested by President Trump and already passed by the Senate, faces a critical deadline, after which the funds must be spent as originally allocated. House leadership is working to resolve the impasse to move the bill forward.</p>

          <p>The White House announced President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common circulatory condition, after he experienced mild leg swelling. CVI occurs when damaged valves in leg veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool, which can lead to swelling, varicose veins, and discomfort. According to his physician, the condition is benign and common in adults over 70. Treatment typically involves non-surgical methods like compression stockings and exercise to strengthen calf muscles, which aid in blood circulation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The lawsuit argues that the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA acted unlawfully by halting the congressionally funded program, which provides federal money for natural disaster mitigation projects. The states claim the decision threatens critical infrastructure projects and leaves communities at higher risk. A recent analysis indicated that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government has stated it "deeply regrets" a strike that hit the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, killing three people who were sheltering inside. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a "mistake" and said an investigation is underway, affirming a commitment to protecting civilians and holy sites. The Israel Defense Forces suggested that fragments from a shell fired during nearby operational activity may have mistakenly hit the church. The attack drew condemnation, with Pope Leo XIV expressing deep sadness and renewing his call for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song "Heterocomía" was a costly artistic endeavor that she does not expect to be profitable. The track features a sample from the Disney film "The Aristocats," for which she brokered an expensive deal, stating the catharsis was worth the price. The song's lyrics, which transition from a whimsical introduction to a tale of deception, have led fans to speculate it is about her past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia. While Belinda has not confirmed the rumors, she seems to value the artistic expression and "sweet revenge" over royalties.</p>

          <p>President Trump "would not recommend" the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, according to the White House press secretary. The statement comes as the president dismisses the controversy over his administration's handling of the case as a "hoax" and criticizes Republicans who are calling for more transparency. Some of the president's allies and supporters have been pushing for a special prosecutor. This development adds another layer to the ongoing political turmoil surrounding the release of government files related to the late sex offender.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has threatened to redraw his state's congressional districts in a bid to counter a Republican plan to gain seats in Texas through redistricting. Newsom's controversial proposal would require circumventing California's independent redistricting commission, which was established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. While Democrats in the state's congressional delegation appear supportive, the plan faces significant legal and political hurdles. Newsom frames the move as necessary hardball politics to combat Republican tactics, but critics warn it undermines democratic principles.</p>

This is the second quarter the company has not released specific subscriber numbers, instead focusing on financial metrics like revenue and operating margin to demonstrate its health and continued progress in building its advertising business.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article argues that universities like Columbia and Harvard are responding to on-campus anti-semitism by implementing bureaucratic measures similar to those used for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives. These steps, which include new coordinators and trainings, are being adopted under pressure from the Trump administration, which is simultaneously working to dismantle DEI programs elsewhere. The author questions the effectiveness of this approach, noting that existing anti-discrimination policies have often been poorly enforced. The piece suggests this strategy risks creating a new form of speech policing rather than fostering genuine liberal education.</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the nomination of Emil Bove, a former personal attorney for President Trump, for a lifetime position on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The vote occurred along party lines, with all Democratic members walking out in protest. Bove's nomination has drawn significant opposition from former Justice Department lawyers and retired judges, who express concern that his loyalty to the president would compromise his judicial impartiality. The opposition also cited whistleblower allegations that Bove encouraged government lawyers to disobey court orders, which he has denied.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's strong 2025 season and All-Star selection can be traced back to a pivotal performance in last year's playoffs. After a difficult rookie season and a poor start in the National League Division Series, Yamamoto delivered five scoreless innings in the decisive Game 5 against the San Diego Padres. That high-pressure success became a major source of confidence, propelling him through the rest of the postseason and into the current season. The article details his growth, adjustments, and newfound status as the most dependable arm in the Dodgers' rotation.</p>

The breach, which occurred in 2022 but was only discovered in 2023, also leaked the information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation, putting them at serious risk of reprisal from the Taliban. The details were kept secret by a court injunction until recently.
