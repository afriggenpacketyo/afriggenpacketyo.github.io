          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE agents in New York City in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz stated that the government failed to prove Khalil's release would cause irreparable harm or that he posed a flight risk. Khalil's attorney, Alina Das, argued that his detention was retaliatory for his protected speech during the Columbia encampment protests against the war in Gaza. The judge's order supersedes an immigration judge's denial of Khalil's asylum request and an order for his continued detention. The ruling came after previous legal battles regarding the grounds for his detention. Optimism score is independent of the summary.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected a request from two toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs. The companies argued that Trump lacked the authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The ruling means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day window to respond to the challenge. Rick Woldenberg, the chairman and CEO of the companies, expressed disappointment but noted that the legal battle will ultimately reach the Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending arguments.

An ICE spokesperson stated the partnership would enhance public safety and national security. Governor Ron DeSantis previously issued an executive order encouraging state-level law enforcement to collaborate with ICE.

          <p>Brent oil prices fell more than 2% on Friday after President Trump delayed a decision on striking Iran, hoping for negotiations. Trump said he would decide within two weeks whether to take military action against Iran's nuclear program, allowing space for potential diplomatic efforts. Despite Trump's hesitation, Israel is escalating its attacks on Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the military to intensify strikes on strategic targets. Defense Minister Israel Katz said this was in response to an Iranian missile hitting a hospital in southern Israel. Optimism score is independent of the summary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Microsoft reveals that employees are experiencing an "infinite workday" characterized by constant emails, meetings, and notifications. Workers check emails early in the morning and stay online late into the night, interrupted every two minutes by various alerts.

The report suggests that workplaces will need to evolve and potentially shift responsibilities to AI agents to mitigate these issues.
