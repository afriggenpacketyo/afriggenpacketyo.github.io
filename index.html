          <p>President Trump stated that there is a strong possibility of reaching a trade agreement with China, emphasizing the need for fairness after alleging past exploitation by China. This statement contrasts with remarks made by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who indicated that no official trade negotiations are currently underway between Washington and Beijing. Greer emphasized the U.S.'s pursuit of a fair trade relationship with China, focusing on eliminating harmful foreign trade practices and promoting domestic production. The conflicting messages highlight the complexities and uncertainties surrounding U.S.-China trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll by the Asian American Foundation indicates that a quarter of non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly concerning national security. Additionally, 40% of non-Asian Americans believe that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. The survey results highlight a growing disconnect between perceptions of Asian-Americans and their actual experiences, raising concerns about discrimination and the stereotype of the "perpetual foreigner." The poll underscores the need to address these misconceptions and promote inclusivity in a time of increasing social tension and strained U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since losing the 2024 election, criticizing President Trump's economic policies and trade war. Harris labeled Trump's tariffs as "reckless" and the "greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history," asserting they are hurting workers, families, and businesses. She warned that the tariffs are inviting a recession and condemned the administration's immigration crackdown, emphasizing the importance of upholding the rule of law. While acknowledging that challenges lie ahead, Harris urged Americans to stand together and defend their country, which belongs to the people, not just the president. </p>

          <p>Several individuals who fled authoritarian regimes are expressing concerns about the tactics employed by the Trump administration, drawing parallels to the oppressive environments they escaped. These immigrants, now U.S. citizens, are troubled by instances of government agents aggressively questioning people at border crossings and the targeting of news organizations critical of the president. Some scholars argue that the U.S. is shifting away from liberal democracy towards authoritarianism, citing the weaponization of government machinery to punish rivals and suppress media. However, some immigrants hold opposing views, claiming that former President Biden's actions, such as censoring social media posts during the COVID-19 pandemic, are more reminiscent of authoritarian leaders. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that India's developing trade deal with the United States and its ongoing conflict with Pakistan could impede the improvement of relations between India and China. While ties between China and India had shown signs of improvement, the forthcoming economic agreement with Washington, initiated in response to increased tariffs on Indian imports, presents a new layer of complexity. Pradeep Taneja from the University of Melbourne notes that these issues could complicate China's efforts to engage with and win over countries in the Global South.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has kept its policy rate unchanged at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, amidst growing concerns over the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the Japanese economy. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, providing potential for rate increases, the central bank acknowledged that Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. The BOJ indicated it would continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are met, but tariffs are complicating these plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan has significantly reduced its economic growth forecast, citing the impact of trade policies on overseas economies and domestic corporate profits. The central bank now expects the Japanese economy to grow by 0.5% in the fiscal year, a substantial decrease from the 1.1% predicted earlier. This adjustment aligns with the International Monetary Fund's lowered outlook for G7 nations, largely due to U.S. tariffs. Trump's import taxes are already affecting the Japanese economy, with companies like Uniqlo cutting profit forecasts due to anticipated tariff impacts. The tariff disruption is exacerbating existing pressures on Japan's fragile economy, complicating the Bank of Japan's efforts to normalize monetary policies. (not investment advice)</p>

While some of the spending has been redirected to other markets, overall advertising expenditure from these advertisers is below previous levels.

The ruling requires Apple to allow apps to provide users with external links to pay developers directly, avoiding the App Store's commission.
