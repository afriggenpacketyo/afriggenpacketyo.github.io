          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called on his party to prepare for a potential general election in 2027. Farage predicts a significant rift within the Labour Party, suggesting it will descend into civil war and lead to an early election, a moment he believes Reform UK must be ready to capitalize on. During a party conference, he outlined key policy goals, including welfare cuts and stricter immigration controls, while emphasizing the party's growing momentum and readiness for government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will allow the U.S. to impose sanctions on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure aims to deter nations from using Americans as political leverage and could include travel restrictions. The move is supported by families of past detainees, including that of Robert Levinson, who died in Iranian custody. The order follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her roles as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after an ethics adviser found she breached the ministerial code by underpaying tax on a property. Rayner admitted to not seeking specialist tax advice regarding the sale of a flat, which should have been declared as a second home, resulting in a £40,000 stamp duty shortfall. Her departure has triggered a major cabinet reshuffle, with David Lammy appointed as the new Deputy Prime Minister. Sir Keir Starmer accepted her resignation, acknowledging her contributions to the Labour government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has become the first U.S. state to announce a plan to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates for schools, a move public health experts warn could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and polio. The decision comes amid a national trend of rising non-medical vaccine exemptions and declining vaccination rates, which threaten the "herd immunity" necessary to protect vulnerable populations. While most states require vaccinations for school entry, Florida's proposed changes represent the most significant rollback of such public health policies. Health officials emphasize that mandates are crucial for maintaining high immunization levels.</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Home Depot as a prime stock to buy. He argues that the disappointing economic data will likely lead the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which would in turn lower mortgage rates and stimulate the housing market. Cramer believes that a drop in 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 6.5% could trigger a significant surge in housing-related stocks, with Home Depot positioned to be a primary beneficiary of increased home improvement activity.

          <p>John Alford, an actor known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a friend's house in 2022. A jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted the 53-year-old on multiple counts, including sexual activity with a 14-year-old and sexual assault of a 15-year-old. The prosecution stated both victims were intoxicated during the incidents, while Alford maintained his innocence, claiming he never touched either girl.

          <p>President Donald Trump has approved legislation that increases the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This reverses a key provision of his 2017 tax law, which first imposed the $10,000 limit on a deduction that had previously been unlimited for over a century. The change primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states who itemize their deductions. While proponents argue it reduces double taxation, critics point to the significant fiscal cost, with estimates suggesting it will add over $142 billion to the national debt over ten years.

          <p>American music star Post Malone has been forced to postpone two upcoming shows at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium due to planned strikes on the London Underground. The concerts, originally scheduled for September 7th and 8th, have been moved to September 20th and 21st. Promoters Live Nation stated that the event license could not be provided without adequate public transport to ensure attendees could travel safely. The postponement follows a similar move by the band Coldplay for their Wembley Stadium shows, as the RMT union proceeds with a five-day walkout over pay and working conditions.</p>

          <h2>Young Germans Increasingly Seek Advice on Avoiding Military Service Amid Conscription Debate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peace organizations in Germany are reporting a significant increase in inquiries from young people on how to conscientiously object to military service. This comes as the German government debates reintroducing some form of conscription to meet NATO obligations, having recently passed a law requiring young men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve. While national service was suspended in 2011, it was never abolished, and the current push to expand the Bundeswehr has raised concerns among youth. Polls show a generational divide, with younger Germans less supportive of mandatory service than older generations.</p>

          <p>A United Nations report has detailed horrific atrocities and serious human rights violations committed by all sides in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, stating that the acts may amount to war crimes. The investigation found that M23 rebels, allegedly with support from Rwanda, have engaged in summary executions, torture, and systematic sexual violence. At the same time, Congolese armed forces and allied pro-government militias have also committed grave abuses, including gang rape and the killing of civilians. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described the findings as horrific, highlighting the immense suffering of the civilian population.</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has told customers who invested in a series of marine loans totaling $89 million that they are unlikely to see any of their principal returned. After the borrowers defaulted, Yieldstreet pursued a lengthy legal recovery effort, culminating in a $5 million settlement. However, the company stated its legal costs exceeded this amount, meaning the funds will go to cover its own expenses rather than repaying investors. This outcome is another blow for the platform, which recently saw customers in four real estate deals wiped out, and has since shifted its business model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant weakening in August, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 22,000, far below the 75,000 expected by economists. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, its highest level since October 2021. Furthermore, data for June was revised to show a net loss of 13,000 jobs, marking the first month of job losses since the pandemic. The sputtering job creation reinforces expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month to support the slowing economy.

          <p>A decade after the arrest of the "Feminist Five," China's feminist movement is grappling with a severe government crackdown, despite growing public awareness of gender issues. Authorities have systematically silenced feminist voices by banning prominent media outlets and social media accounts, often under vague charges like "provoking trouble" or "inciting gender confrontation." Activists are smeared as agents of foreign influence, and online discussions about #MeToo, domestic violence, and discrimination are heavily censored. Despite the hostile environment and fragmentation of the movement, activists express a cautious hope that resistance will continue in decentralized forms.</p>

The senators assert that the Smithsonian is an independent federal trust overseen by Congress, not an executive agency under presidential control.

          <p>Despite the Chinese government's massive military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, rare acts of public defiance have surfaced. One activist, Qi Hong, projected anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing, an act he said was motivated by the government's "hate propaganda." While state media promoted nationalistic fervor for the parade, which featured leaders from Russia and North Korea, observers noted a divided public sentiment.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that major news organizations have been too hesitant to report on President Trump's health, contrasting their recent silence during his brief disappearance from public view with the intense scrutiny of Joe Biden's age during his presidency.

After successfully lobbying to have the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled firearms removed in a recent budget bill, these groups have now filed lawsuits aiming to strike down the NFA's remaining registration requirements as unconstitutional. This push, once considered a fringe goal, has gained mainstream Republican support, reflecting a broader shift towards a more absolutist interpretation of the Second Amendment.</p>

The reviewer praises Lee's ability to evoke feeling and atmosphere through powerful imagery, a skill evident in his later film work like "Burning." The stories, written early in his career during the repressive Chun Doo-hwan dictatorship, are described as capturing the era's paranoia and harshness without resorting to direct explanation. Instead, Lee uses cinematic techniques on the page, employing light, darkness, and visual distortion to communicate the complex personal and political struggles of his characters.</p>
