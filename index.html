          <p>A Trump-appointed judge in California has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership under the 1798 law. The judge, John Holcomb, stated that the government had not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation, emphasizing that individuals should have the opportunity to contest their designation as an alien enemy. While other judges have questioned the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act for gang-related deportations, Holcomb focused on the lack of due process afforded to the migrants, adding to the complicated legal landscape surrounding the Act. </p>

          <p>An escaped zebra caused traffic disruptions on a busy Tennessee roadway after escaping from its owners over the weekend. The zebra, which had been recently "obtained" by its owners, was reported missing on Saturday and was later spotted near Interstate 24. Deputies closed lanes of traffic to ensure the safety of both travelers and the animal as it ran through the highway. The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office did not disclose how the owners acquired the zebra or where it was being housed at the time of its escape, but authorities were able to capture the zebra after a brief chase. </p>

          <p>Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have released new details about an attack on a group rallying for Israeli hostages in Gaza, in which a suspect threw Molotov cocktails at the crowd, injuring 12 people. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism, with the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, facing multiple felony charges, including a federal hate crime charge. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine!" during the attack and had 16 unused Molotov cocktails within reach at the time of his arrest. The victims included a Holocaust refugee and a university professor, and the attack has been widely condemned as an antisemitic act of violence.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder.

Soliman, who is an Egyptian national in the United States illegally, allegedly planned the attack for a year but waited until his daughter's high school graduation to carry it out. He is accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and throwing incendiary devices into a crowd of demonstrators, injuring 12 people.</p>

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates to increase vetting for all visa applicants seeking to attend Harvard University, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus. Consular officers are directed to conduct a thorough screening of applicants' online presence and consider the lack of an online presence as potentially evasive. The State Department spokesperson stated that this is a pilot program which may be expanded to other groups of applicants. The decision follows two executive orders by President Trump, one focused on visa vetting and the other on combating antisemitism, and is a response to what the administration views as Harvard's failure to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains optimistic that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will secure investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has advocated for Alaska LNG as a national priority, urging Japan and South Korea to invest in the project. Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes that securing commercial offtakers for the gas will make financing straightforward, but energy analysts remain skeptical about the project's commercial viability. The administration plans to build the project in stages, initially serving domestic demand in Alaska, with the Department of Defense potentially supporting the project by signing an offtake agreement to supply gas to strategic bases across Alaska.

The settlement ends years of conflict and enables greater collaboration between the agencies to improve their finances and efficiently move water where needed.

          <p>Despite a voter turnout of less than 13%, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has described the recent judicial elections as "marvelous, impressive, and extraordinary." The low participation rate has been attributed to factors such as the off-year election cycle, a convoluted balloting process, and the obscurity of the candidates. Opponents have criticized the election as a "festival of voter fraud" and a threat to judicial independence, while experts suggest that the results are likely to reinforce the power of Sheinbaum's Morena party. The new Supreme Court will have fewer judges and less authority to challenge legislative and presidential decisions.</p>

Critics argue that the low turnout undermines the ruling party's claim of a mandate for its ongoing transformation of Mexican society.

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza. Disputed reports indicate that Israeli forces may have opened fire on civilians waiting for food. Witnesses claim they were shot at while waiting for aid from a center run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF denied the reports, stating they were fabrications and that no injuries or fatalities occurred at or near their facility, while the Israeli military also denied firing at civilians, accusing Hamas of spreading rumors.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have failed once again to reach an agreement on a ceasefire during talks in Istanbul, but they did commit to exchanging prisoners of war. The two sides agreed to exchange all sick and heavily wounded prisoners, as well as those under 25. Ukraine is insisting on a full and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days to end the killings, while Russia continues to demand a Ukrainian military withdrawal from occupied regions and recognition of annexed territories. Despite the lack of progress on a ceasefire, the agreement to exchange prisoners is a small step towards humanitarian relief.</p>

The runway, which had been closed for renovations, resumed operations following a 60-day project that was completed 13 days early. The reopening is expected to alleviate pressure on the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages and technical issues. The FAA is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well, which could further increase the airport's capacity.</p>
