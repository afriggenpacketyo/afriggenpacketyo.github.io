            <p>China has retaliated against the United States' increased tariffs by raising its levies on U.S. goods to 125%. The Chinese finance ministry stated that further tariff increases from the U.S. would be economically meaningless. Despite the trade war escalation, China's commerce ministry reiterated its willingness to negotiate with the U.S. on equal terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China's trade practices, calling the escalation a loss for them. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is invoking the McCarran-Walter Act, a Cold War-era law, to potentially deport pro-Palestinian student protesters. This law allows the government to deport non-citizens whose activities are deemed to have adverse foreign policy consequences. Critics argue this infringes on free speech rights and echoes the red scare tactics of the 1950s. The case of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student, highlights the debate over free speech for immigrants.</p>
