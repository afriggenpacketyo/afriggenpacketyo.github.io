          <p>A coalition of 30 major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has sent an open letter to the UK's finance minister urging the creation of a national stablecoin strategy. The group argues that without a proactive approach, the UK risks falling behind the U.S. and becoming a "rule-taker" in the digital asset space. They contend that embracing stablecoins as financial infrastructure, rather than just a risk to be managed, could strengthen the UK's position as a global financial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI achieved a major financial milestone in July, recording its first month with over $1 billion in revenue. Despite this rapid growth, CFO Sarah Friar stated the company is "constantly under compute," facing voracious demand for the processing power needed to train and run its AI models. This highlights the immense operational costs and infrastructure challenges facing leading AI firms, necessitating massive investments in data centers and partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford have created a "superfood" for honeybees that could help protect them from threats like climate change and habitat loss. The supplement contains all the essential nutrients bees need to thrive, particularly sterols, which have been difficult to synthesize previously. In trials, colonies that consumed the food saw the survival rate of their young increase by up to 15 times, offering a promising tool for beekeepers.</p>
