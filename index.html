          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state police to find and arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled to other states to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The lawmakers' departure denied the state House the necessary quorum to conduct business, effectively halting the special session. In response, the Republican-controlled House voted to issue civil arrest warrants, though their authority does not extend beyond Texas. The political standoff escalates as Democrats hold events in blue states to protest the proposed maps, which they argue are a partisan power grab.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant decline in volunteer firefighters across the United States is straining emergency services and could force many towns to switch to paid departments, a costly alternative for taxpayers. The number of volunteers has dropped by over 20% in recent decades while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout and resource shortages. To combat this, some lawmakers are proposing incentives like student loan forgiveness to attract new recruits and sustain a system that saves taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. Without more volunteers, communities may face a difficult choice between public safety and financial burden.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The judge cited Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, including a ban on using social media, which he allegedly circumvented through allies. Bolsonaro's legal team denies any breach and plans to appeal the decision. The situation has drawn international attention, with the U.S. State Department condemning the order and Donald Trump calling the trial a "witch-hunt."</p>

          <p>In the Yorkshire Dales, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age, inside a cave near Ingleborough. The discovery was part of a larger project exploring the prehistoric use of the region's cave systems, which also found evidence of Neolithic human burials. This finding provides new insights into the long history of farming and human activity on the land. The project underscores the vital role that recreational cavers play in making significant archaeological finds in inaccessible underground locations.</p>

          <p>A report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that Taiwan's critical supplies would be exhausted quickly in the event of a Chinese military blockade. The analysis, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, estimates that the island's natural gas would last only 11 days, with coal reserves depleted in seven weeks and oil in 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-cost option for Beijing. The war games indicated such an action would likely incur high casualties and risk escalating into a wider conflict involving the United States.</p>

Brown's family members stated he has struggled with mental illness for years, suggesting the tragic event may have been the result of a mental health crisis.</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prizes from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program are currently unclaimed, prompting criticism that the operator, NS&I, isn't doing enough to locate winners. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue the process for tracing accounts is overly difficult, especially for those who were gifted bonds as children or only possess old paper records. NS&I states it has paid over 99% of winners and provides a tracing service, but some customers report frustrating, bureaucratic experiences.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who also serves as interim NASA administrator, is set to announce an expedited plan to develop a nuclear reactor on the moon. The directive aims to advance fission surface power to support a future lunar economy and strengthen national security in space. This move is seen as a response to a joint initiative by China and Russia to establish their own lunar reactor by the mid-2030s. The plan prioritizes swift action to prevent the U.S. from being inhibited by potential "keep-out zones" established by other nations on the lunar surface.</p>

This strategy shifts away from relying on private prison companies and uses a new $45 billion funding pool to expand ICE's detention capacity.

Abbott cited a nonbinding 2021 attorney general opinion suggesting a court could declare an office forfeited due to abandonment. However, a political science expert notes that the only established ways to remove a Texas lawmaker are through a two-thirds expulsion vote by the legislature or by voters at the ballot box.

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This positive trend is directly linked to the 2021 recommendation to lower the standard screening age from 50 to 45. Screenings in this age group rose by 62% from 2019 to 2023, allowing for earlier detection when the cancer is more treatable. While experts call the findings promising, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across different education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to become a major destination for medical tourism, with plans to attract over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027. The initiative aims to introduce dozens of international innovative drugs and medical devices each year. This strategic push comes as a key competitor, South Korea, is set to lose some of its appeal. A new South Korean policy will eliminate value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery and other medical beauty services starting next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that people coming off obesity medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year. Experience shows that patients often regain a significant portion of the weight they lost once they stop the injections, which work by reducing appetite. Health assessment body NICE emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process, not a quick fix. The advice encourages creating a sustainable plan involving healthy eating, physical activity, and behavioral support to maintain weight loss.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a White House task force dedicated to security for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. This move follows the passage of legislation that secured $1 billion for security, planning, and other costs associated with hosting the massive international event. The task force's establishment comes as LA city leaders and the LA28 organizing committee are negotiating key issues, including the costs for using city police and other public employees. The White House emphasized the President's commitment to making the Games exciting and memorable.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Mirta Amarilis Co Tupul, a woman who has lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years, have filed a lawsuit to stop her imminent deportation to Guatemala. The case is seen as a test of a federal law that prevents the expedited removal of immigrants who have been in the country for more than two years without a judicial hearing. Her attorneys argue the Trump administration is illegally applying expedited removal to longtime residents, bypassing due process. ICE officials stated Co Tupul was placed in the fast-track process after declining to answer questions about her immigration status upon arrest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News review of claims made by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) indicates that its reported savings are significantly overstated. For three of the largest canceled contracts from the Department of Health and Human Services, DOGE claimed savings of $6.4 billion. However, an analysis of transaction records shows the actual savings from unspent obligated funds were closer to $165 million. Critics describe the agency's public accounting as "transparency theater," arguing that it reports the total potential value of contracts as savings, a figure that is rarely reached.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that a series of events over five days constitutes a significant attack on truth by the Trump administration. The article cites the removal of Trump's impeachments from a Smithsonian exhibit, the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over revised jobs data, and the confirmation of a partisan media personality as a top prosecutor. These actions, the author contends, represent a collective assault on historical records, government statistics, and the impartial administration of justice, creating a bleak outlook for fact-based governance.</p>

          <p>California is currently experiencing a worse-than-average wildfire season, with the total acreage burned already significantly outpacing the five-year average for this time of year. The surge is largely driven by several large, early-season fires across a parched Central and Southern California, where limited winter rain left vegetation exceptionally dry. While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that a coming heat wave will increase fire risk statewide. Crews are currently battling the 65,000-acre Gifford fire, which is exhibiting erratic, plume-dominated behavior.</p>

          <p>In a surprising turn, an ex-girlfriend of Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who was slated to testify against him as "Victim-3," has written a letter to the judge advocating for his release on bail. Virginia Huynh, identifying herself for the first time, stated she does not view Combs as a danger and believes he has made efforts to become a better person. Huynh had mysteriously dropped out as a prosecution witness just before the trial began. Despite her letter, the judge denied Combs' latest request for bail, and he will remain incarcerated until his October sentencing.</p>

          <p>California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are preparing a countermove to a Republican redistricting effort in Texas that could determine control of the U.S. House. The plan involves putting a measure on the November ballot to redraw California's congressional maps, but it includes a "trigger" provision. This means California would only proceed with its mid-decade redistricting if Texas Republicans move forward with their own plan to add more GOP seats. The high-stakes political chess match puts pressure on Texas Republicans, as California could potentially create several more Democratic-leaning districts.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at an unofficial afterparty for the Hard Summer music festival in downtown Los Angeles left two people dead and six others wounded early Monday morning. Police had responded to a large party at a warehouse building earlier in the night and made one arrest, but were called back around 1 a.m. to reports of shots fired. A man and a woman were killed in the incident. Authorities have not yet released information about a suspect or motive, and the investigation is ongoing as officials condemn the senseless violence.</p>
