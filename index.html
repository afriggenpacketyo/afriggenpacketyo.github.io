          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded a high-stakes summit in Alaska, which Trump described as "productive" despite failing to secure a breakthrough on the war in Ukraine. No ceasefire agreement was announced, though Putin extended an invitation for a future meeting in Moscow. The talks, which excluded Ukrainian representatives, were framed by the White House as a listening exercise. Following the meeting, Trump suggested in an interview that it is now up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the conflict.</p>

Rooney also shares insights into his transition to management, his new role as a pundit, and the sacrifices his parents made to support his journey in the sport.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the dynamic between Trump and Putin, suggesting Putin successfully appealed to Trump by endorsing his views on the 2020 election and the Ukraine war's origins. It frames the summit as a diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who was welcomed back onto the world stage with a red carpet after years of being shunned by most Western nations. The piece highlights the deferential treatment Putin received and his use of Trump's own talking points to build rapport during their discussions.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down the summit's key outcomes, noting it was a symbolic victory for Putin, who was welcomed back onto the world stage. It highlights the lack of a concrete deal on Ukraine, with Putin reiterating maximalist demands for a ceasefire that amount to Kyiv's capitulation. The analysis also points to the vagueness of Trump's statements and the significance of Putin receiving an invitation to the U.S. and extending one for a future meeting in Moscow, despite his international isolation.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is introducing new residency regulations that require mainland Chinese nationals applying to live on the island to provide notarized proof that they have relinquished their Chinese household registration and passport. The policy, initiated by President Lai, is a response to perceived security threats from Beijing, including societal infiltration and identity ambiguity. Critics have described the move as an "attack" on these spouses, marking a significant and controversial shift in cross-strait residency governance.</p>

Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the team's often-unreliable bullpen successfully protected a narrow lead to end a four-game losing streak. The win provided a crucial morale boost for the team, which had recently fallen behind the Padres in the standings after a period of inconsistent play.</p>

          <p>Democrats in California have unveiled a plan to redraw the state's congressional district boundaries, aiming to gain up to five U.S. House seats in a bid to control Congress. This move is a direct response to a similar Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas and is intended to strengthen the party's advantage ahead of the midterm elections. The proposal, which would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval, would significantly reshape several GOP-held districts to favor Democratic candidates.</p>
