          <p>President Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and significantly higher rates on specific countries.  These "reciprocal tariffs" target nations perceived as unfair trading partners, aiming to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce trade deficits. However, economists warn of potential inflationary pressures and negative impacts on consumers.</p>
