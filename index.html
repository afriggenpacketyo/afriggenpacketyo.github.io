        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a "Complete and Total" ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, intended to end the conflict that began on June 13th. The ceasefire was set to begin at midnight ET, with a complete end to the "12 DAY WAR" expected 24 hours later. The conflict started with Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, resulting in significant casualties on both sides, and prompted retaliatory missile strikes. The U.S. also took military action, striking three sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program, which sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response was fairly limited. The announcement of a ceasefire is aimed at de-escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Florida will receive federal funds to establish immigration detention centers, including a controversial site in the Everglades dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." FEMA will largely fund the project, repurposing an abandoned airfield to house immigrants with criminal records awaiting deportation. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier stated that "Alligator Alcatraz" and other facilities could collectively house up to 5,000 detainees. This initiative is part of a broader effort by Republican-led states to assist the Trump administration in its mass deportation campaign, with law enforcement officials in states like Louisiana, Texas, and Florida aiding in immigration arrests.</p>

Lovelady, whose first name is Richard, was activated for the game against the Atlanta Braves, and baseball fans reacted on social media. Lovelady was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in 2016 and has also played for the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, Tampa Bay Rays, and Toronto Blue Jays.

          <p>Vets and animal charities report that rising vet bills are causing more pet owners to euthanize their animals or delay necessary treatment, with some owners surrendering their pets or foregoing future ownership. Many blame corporate acquisitions of veterinary practices for driving up prices, while the British Veterinary Association cites various reasons for increased costs. The Blue Cross charity has seen a significant increase in applications for financial assistance for emergency care, highlighting the growing crisis. A survey by Cats Protection found that cost was the biggest barrier to cat owners seeking veterinary care, leading to concerns about animal welfare.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" of missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the attack as "very weak." He thanked Iran for the warning, which he said allowed for the prevention of casualties, suggesting the counterattack was expected and calibrated. Following the strikes, Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, urging both nations to pursue peace and harmony. This move echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. base in Iraq, where advance notice was given, minimizing damage and avoiding escalation.</p>

Nashi's actions have touched a nerve in China, where social justice is a sensitive issue due to the country's wealth gap and social class divisions. The gaokao, China's national college entrance exam, is considered crucial for social mobility, offering a meritocratic system for students from less privileged backgrounds to secure opportunities.</p>

The party, which gained three seats in the lower house election, blends nationalism with frustration over daily life, particularly among those who feel left behind. Supporters advocate for stricter regulations on foreign land acquisition and tighter controls on foreign workers, reflecting a broader sense of crisis and a desire to preserve traditional Japanese values.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices. Although initial market reactions included a surge in oil prices, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for oil transport. Analysts suggest that ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, potentially driving prices higher. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz would severely impact oil markets in Asia, while even a limited disruption could cause prices to spike, affecting global GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The last Burrito Gallery location in Jacksonville, Florida, abruptly closed after more than nine years of operation, marking the end of the local chain's presence in the city. Signs on the doors announced the closure, thanking customers for their patronage over the years. The restaurant's food service license was listed as "delinquent, active" with an expiration date of June 1. The closure follows the shuttering of three other Burrito Gallery locations since November 2023, leaving the community without its "Jax Mex" cuisine.</p>

          <p>Before embarking on missions that can exceed 40 hours, pilots of the U.S. Air Force's B-2 Spirit stealth bomber undergo extensive preparation, including nutritional education. Pilots learn about foods that affect alertness and digestion, critical for long intercontinental flights. Retired Lt. Gen. Steve Basham, a former B-2 pilot, emphasizes the importance of bland, easily digestible meals like turkey sandwiches without cheese. The B-2's success relies on human performance, as the two-person crew must manage mid-air refuelings and maintain alertness during extended operations.</p>

While reserving the right to respond, Trump indicated there are no active plans for the U.S. to retaliate at this time, emphasizing that Iran has "gotten it all out of their 'system'."

Trump's use of the phrase "Make Iran Great Again" to describe potential regime change has drawn criticism for echoing past interventionist policies. While some aides, like Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance, have attempted to downplay the possibility of regime change, Trump's rhetoric suggests broader ambitions in the region. This shift highlights the tension between Trump's "America First" agenda and the potential for deeper involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts.</p>

          <p>Analysts in Taiwan have expressed concerns that increased U.S. military engagement in the Middle East could divert attention and resources from the Taiwan Strait. The analysts' main concern is that the United States, already deeply engaged in supporting Ukraine, would have fewer military resources and less political bandwidth to respond swiftly should Beijing move against Taiwan. The concern arises from the potential strain on U.S. military resources and political focus, which could affect its ability to respond to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East could potentially reduce America's capacity to support Taiwan.</p>
