          <p>President Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill failed to advance through the House Budget Committee due to Republican disagreements. The primary sticking points include the amount of spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and the level of state and local tax deductions. Conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to avoid swelling America's public debt, while lawmakers from high-tax states are objecting to the proposed cap on local tax deductions. Moody's also downgraded the US credit rating citing rising debt.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires a shareholder or group of shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to institute a derivative proceeding. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law and makes it more difficult for shareholders to hold insiders accountable. The company moved its site of incorporation to Texas in June 2024 after losing a court case in Delaware.</p>
