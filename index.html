            <p>Pope Francis, known for his humility and outreach to diverse communities, passed away at the age of 88, as confirmed by the Vatican. Cardinal Kevin Farrell stated that Pope Francis dedicated his life to serving the Lord and the Church. He had been hospitalized for over five weeks, initially for a respiratory tract infection that later developed into bilateral pneumonia. The pontiff's tenure was marked by efforts to modernize the Catholic Church and address global social issues.</p>

More than half of Americans expect to outlive their savings, and retirement confidence has decreased by 7 percentage points from last year.

            <p>The Justice Department told a federal judge that accused migrant gang members will have at least 24 hours to file a habeas petition contesting their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. This move comes amid pushback on the Trump administration's efforts to deport migrants with limited due process. The ACLU argues that 24 hours is insufficient time to prepare a petition. The Supreme Court recently blocked AEA deportations of Venezuelan migrants being held in Texas.</p>

            <p>Gold prices reached a new record, breaking $3,400 per ounce, as President Trump's threats against the Federal Reserve's independence and his tariffs shake investor confidence in the U.S. economy.

Citi analysts predict gold prices could rally to $3,500 due to tariff-related growth concerns and strong central bank demand.</p>
