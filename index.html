        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, predicting 10-15mm of rain in less than an hour and potentially 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency warns of frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds, which could disrupt transport, delay train services, cause power outages, and damage buildings. This follows an unusually dry spring, with some areas potentially receiving more rain on Saturday than they did throughout the entire month of May. While not every location will experience heavy showers, those that do could face significant disruptions. The yellow warning is the lowest level issued by the Met Office, indicating the probability of severe weather and its potential impact.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is concluding its first-ever celebration in Washington, D.C., featuring a weekend parade that begins in a historic gay neighborhood and ends at the U.S. Capitol. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., which typically draw hundreds of thousands of attendees. Despite the usual scale of Pride festivities, organizers note that the current political climate has dampened excitement, with some members of the queer community expressing reservations due to executive orders limiting the rights of trans people. Several corporate sponsors have also declined to support the event this year, following Trump's executive order targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the finale weekend has sparked controversy.</p>

          <p>Lauren Sánchez celebrated her upcoming wedding to Jeff Bezos with a three-day bachelorette party in Paris, attended by celebrities including Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, and Eva Longoria. The festivities included a dinner at Lafayette's and a yacht party. The Bezos-Sánchez wedding is reportedly being held in Venice, Italy, with a star-studded guest list expected to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, and Oprah Winfrey. Sánchez's friendships extend beyond her bachelorette attendees, as she recently flew on an all-female Blue Origin mission with Gayle King and others. Sánchez and Bezos reportedly met in the mid-2010s and went public with their relationship in 2019, after Sánchez separated from her husband and Bezos divorced his wife.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Georgia law granting personhood to a fetus is being tested in the case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead pregnant woman on life support, raising questions about whether the law requires doctors to maintain life support. Smith's mother claims doctors put her daughter on life support without consulting the family due to the LIFE Act, which recognizes "unborn children" as "living, distinct persons." While Georgia's Attorney General believes the law doesn't restrict options in Smith's care, the law's author disagrees, highlighting the complexities of applying fetal personhood laws in medical situations. The case underscores the broader implications of personhood laws, which can affect fertility treatment and pregnancy complications, as well as child support and tax calculations.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, emphasizing that strengthening foot muscles can reduce pain and prevent injury. These exercises include foot doming, which strengthens the foot core; wall stretches, which increase blood flow and relieve pain; toe spreads, which improve flexibility and stability; toe yoga, which enhances balance; calf raises, which strengthen stabilizing muscles; and foot massages, which loosen tension and lubricate joints. Consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with preexisting foot conditions. Regular foot exercises can improve overall foot health and prevent future problems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe that current store prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns about the rising cost of this staple food. As rice prices have doubled in the past year, more than 40 percent of producers worry that consumers may start avoiding rice altogether. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers to try to lower prices, which average 4,200 yen ($29) per 5 kilograms. While producers and consumers may disagree on the ideal price, the association of agricultural corporations suggests 3,000 yen per 5 kg would be reasonable. (not investment advice)</p>

Since October 2021, Vietnam has reclaimed over 8.5 sq km of new land, including building an airstrip on Barque Canada Reef expected to be about 3,000 meters long.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to reduce the amount of foreign aid used to cover hotel costs for asylum seekers, with plans to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the £2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. The Home Office aims to end asylum hotels by speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayer money. Foreign aid is intended for alleviating poverty overseas, but international rules allow governments to use some of their aid budgets to support asylum seekers during their first year. Labour has promised to end asylum hotels, but the Home Office's ODA spending remains high, leading to cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities worldwide.</p>

Despite a league season that fell short of expectations, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust acknowledged that most fans will "love Ange forever" and called for his replacement to be fully supported by the club's board.

The country is grappling with two major conflicts: a civil war in the western regions and destabilization in the Lake Chad region due to Islamist militants.

          <p>A series of surprise raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Los Angeles led to strong reactions from officials and protesters, who denounced the actions as "cruel and unnecessary." Tensions escalated after federal authorities detained employees at a clothing store and used stun grenades and pepper spray against protesters. Demonstrators gathered in front of the federal building, demanding the release of SEIU California President David Huerta, who was injured and detained while documenting a raid. Forty-four people were arrested administratively, and one for obstruction during the immigration action.</p>

          <p>Tehran has condemned the U.S. travel ban on Iranians and citizens of 11 other mostly Middle Eastern and African countries, calling Washington’s decision a sign of a “racist mentality.” Donald Trump signed an executive order reviving sweeping restrictions justified on national security grounds. Alireza Hashemi-Raja, the foreign ministry’s director general for the affairs of Iranians abroad, called the measure “a clear sign of the dominance of a supremacist and racist mentality among American policymakers.” The ban targets nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.</p>
