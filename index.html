          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Suspending Habeas Corpus for Migrants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 18:27:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is considering suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right that allows a person to challenge their detention in court, for migrants. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated this is an option being actively explored, justifying it by arguing that the U.S. faces a national security threat due to undocumented migrants. Legal experts contend that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without congressional authorization, referencing historical precedents such as Abraham Lincoln's actions during the Civil War. The decision hinges on whether the courts align with the administration's stance on immigration enforcement, particularly regarding deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has scheduled a resentencing hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez, set to take place on May 13 and 14, after they have spent over three decades in prison for the murder of their parents. The hearing follows multiple postponements and will involve testimonies from family members, fellow inmates, and correctional officials, all attesting to the brothers' rehabilitation. The brothers claim they suffered years of sexual assault by their father, Jose Menendez, with their mother complicit. District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't shown sufficient insight into their crimes, while the brothers' lawyers briefly sought to have the DA's office recused from the case.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has reemerged into the public eye, giving interviews and planning to write a book, leading to a divide among Democrats regarding his role in the party. While some Democrats, like Rep. Jim Clyburn and former DNC Chair Jamie Harrison, welcome Biden's return and advocate for him to defend his record, others believe he should remain out of the spotlight. Critics argue that Biden's focus on relitigating his past campaign is stagnating the party and preventing it from moving forward, suggesting he should instead focus on his presidential library and foundation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has criticized Minnesota Democrats for not honoring an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer after an Ecuadorian national, German Adriano Llangari Inga, allegedly killed a mother in a drunk driving incident and is now at large. ICE had placed a detainer on Llangari Inga with the Hennepin County Jail, but the jail did not honor it, citing guidance from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office. White House officials argue that this situation exemplifies why the Trump Administration is cracking down on "sanctuary jurisdictions" and holding them accountable for their immigration policies. Minnesota officials defend their sanctuary laws, emphasizing that they do not enforce federal immigration law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York is set to lower the minimum hiring age for prison guards from 21 to 18 in response to a severe correction officer shortage. This shortage was exacerbated by the firing of over 2,000 guards following a strike protesting poor working conditions. The new law will impose restrictions on younger guards, such as prohibiting them from carrying firearms or transporting inmates unsupervised during their first 18 months. This decision follows incidents such as the fatal beating of Robert Brooks and the death of Messiah Nantwi, which led to charges against several guards.</p>

          <p>At least half a dozen USAID employees who spoke to reporters after receiving notices of termination from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are now facing internal investigations. The employees are accused of engaging with the press without authorization and are threatened with disciplinary action, including removal from USAID. The American Foreign Service Association, the union representing USAID employees, has called the investigations intimidation, arguing that federal employees retain their constitutional rights. These actions have created a chilling effect and are seen as an attempt to stifle criticism of the administration's actions.</p>

Xi and Putin pledged to enhance cooperation and counter what they see as Washington's attempt to contain their nations.

          <p>Fifteen states are suing the Trump administration over its efforts to fast-track oil and gas projects, alleging that the administration is bypassing environmental protection laws. The lawsuit claims that agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior are circumventing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The states argue that this improper permitting process will cause significant harm to state natural and historic resources. The White House defends the executive order, asserting the president's authority to determine national emergencies and prioritize American energy production.</p>

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. have experienced a significant drop due to steep tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April fell by 21% compared to the previous year. As a result, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, demonstrating the impact of tariffs on trade patterns. The president has suggested a potential reduction in tariffs to 80%, but even at that level, importing goods from China would remain expensive for many U.S. businesses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has praised the new trade pact with the U.K. as a "maxed out deal," but some experts suggest that it may not be as beneficial as it sounds. Despite some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports, which is higher than the pre-Trump status quo. Economists warn that even with lower tariffs, businesses will likely pay more for imported goods, leading to higher prices for consumers. Uncertainty over the long-term impact of tariffs continues to pose significant risks to businesses and the economy.</p>
