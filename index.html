        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article chronicles the evolution of the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, from key advisor to public adversaries. Initially, Musk was a prominent figure in Trump's inner circle, leading the Department of Government Efficiency and supporting Trump's policies. The relationship soured after Musk's departure from the White House, triggered by his opposition to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The feud escalated with social media attacks and accusations, culminating in Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts and Musk alleging Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Optimism for their reconciliation seems unlikely given the depth of the current conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suspended foreign student visas at Harvard University, citing national security concerns and accusing the institution of having "extensive entanglements" with foreign countries. Harvard responded by filing court documents to block the order, calling it a retaliatory measure violating the university's First Amendment rights. The suspension affects international students seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard, potentially impacting nearly 7,000 students. This action follows previous disputes between the Trump administration and Harvard over federal funding and allegations of antisemitism on campus.</p>

This test is a key step in China's transition towards a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered a more efficient and secure alternative to quantum key distribution (QKD), as it sends messages directly through a quantum channel without needing encryption keys.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served while awaiting trial. This practice adds months to the confinement of young people, impacting their rehabilitation and placing a financial burden on taxpayers. Experts argue that this disparity stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, leading to unequal application of fundamental rights. The lack of credit for time served can have negative consequences on young people's education, employment prospects, and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The escalating feud between Elon Musk and President Trump has raised concerns about potential retaliatory measures from both sides. Each party possesses considerable resources to inflict damage on the other. Trump could target Musk's business interests through government contracts and regulations, while Musk could leverage his wealth and influence to support political opponents or expose damaging information. The conflict's unpredictable nature and the power wielded by both individuals have Washington bracing for further developments.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a fraudulent social media advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The scam entices users to provide personal information and pay through unofficial channels, such as Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal data or payments through social media or transaction applications. To avoid falling victim to this scam, the DMV advises renewing vehicle registrations only through its official website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>
