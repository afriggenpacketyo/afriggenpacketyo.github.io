          <p>North Korea has officially confirmed that it deployed troops to fight alongside Russia in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The troops reportedly assisted Russian forces in "completely liberating" the Kursk border region, as ordered by Kim Jong Un, in accordance with a mutual defense treaty between Pyongyang and Moscow. While Western officials previously estimated that at least 1,000 North Korean troops had been killed over three months, Pyongyang's announcement marks the first official acknowledgement of their involvement. This development further solidifies the alliance between North Korea and Russia, with Pyongyang pledging continued support for the Russian army.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that US tariffs on Chinese imports could jeopardize up to 16 million jobs in China, particularly in manufacturing sectors producing goods for retail and wholesale. The report identifies communication equipment, apparel, and chemical products as especially vulnerable due to their high proportion of US-bound exports from China. This analysis comes as the US has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory measures from Beijing. The Chinese Politburo has pledged to stabilize the economy and employment in response to the potential impact of the tariffs.</p>

This repowering activity offers economic benefits, including increased electricity output and longer lifecycles, and it also invigorates the turbine recycling industry. The sector faces challenges from public opposition and supply chain issues, but the growing demand for electricity is driving the need for repowering existing wind farms.</p>
