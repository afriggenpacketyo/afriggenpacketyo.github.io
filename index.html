          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed his negotiating team to commence talks for a ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. This move comes as the cabinet also approved military plans for an assault on Gaza City. While Hamas had previously agreed to a 60-day ceasefire proposal from mediators, Netanyahu has not accepted the current terms, stating that defeating Hamas and releasing hostages are interconnected goals. Israeli officials have expressed opposition to any deal that involves only a partial release of hostages.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested an undocumented immigrant in Chaffee County, Colorado, after she allegedly fled a traffic stop and attempted to seek sanctuary in a county probation office. The driver, Carolina Suarez-Estrada, was with the initial target of the stop, Darwin Arriche-Sierra, a Venezuelan citizen with prior DUI convictions. The incident occurs as the Trump administration pressures sanctuary jurisdictions, including Chaffee County, to increase cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The agency stated Suarez-Estrada will remain in custody pending immigration proceedings.</p>

The president mobilized nearly 2,000 guardsmen to the capital, claiming crime was out of control, a statement disputed by the city's official statistics which show a 30-year low. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the federal surge as politically motivated, while the administration points to hundreds of arrests as proof of its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>In a politically charged battle prompted by President Trump, Texas and California are moving forward with plans to redraw their congressional maps mid-decade to favor their respective dominant parties. Texas Republicans are finalizing a map aimed at adding five GOP seats, a move lauded by Trump but decried by Democrats as a partisan gerrymander that dilutes the votes of minority communities. In response, California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are advancing their own proposal to create five new Democratic-leaning districts, arguing they must "fight fire with fire."</p>

          <p>The California Assembly has approved the first of three bills in a legislative package designed to redraw the state's congressional districts, aiming to create five new Democratic seats in the U.S. House. This action is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas, which was initiated at the behest of President Donald Trump to gain more GOP seats. California Governor Gavin Newsom has framed the move as a necessary countermeasure to what he calls a Republican "power grab," setting the stage for an unprecedented partisan redistricting battle between the nation's two most populous states.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has publicly declared Beijing's firm support for New Delhi in opposition to what he termed "bully" tactics by the United States regarding trade tariffs. Speaking at a summit, the envoy criticized steep U.S. tariffs of up to 50% on India, advocating for collaboration between the two Asian powers to uphold the multilateral trading system. This expression of solidarity is notable given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and India, but it reflects a shared opposition to President Trump's aggressive global trade policies.</p>

          <p>A torrential downpour of historic proportions caused rapid and severe flooding at the Wisconsin State Fair Park, forcing the cancellation of the event's final day. Officials attribute the swift inundation to several factors, including an overwhelmed drainage system and the inadequacy of culverts carrying Honey Creek beneath the fairgrounds, which were built in the 1960s for less intense storms. While a project to rehabilitate the creek's infrastructure was already underway, it was paused for the fair. Vendors will be responsible for their own property damage costs, though many report lost sales as the bigger financial blow.</p>

          <p>A federal jury has convicted Jinchao Wei, an active-duty U.S. Navy sailor, of selling sensitive national defense information to a Chinese intelligence officer for approximately $12,000. Wei, who held a security clearance, provided photos, videos, and technical manuals related to the U.S.S. Essex and other Navy ships over an 18-month period. Prosecutors stated Wei was recruited via social media and used encrypted apps to communicate with his handler, a tactic officials describe as a rising threat of "virtual espionage." Wei now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p>

Select customers will be able to receive their orders via Zipline's autonomous aircraft, which can deliver a package by lowering a small robot from an altitude of 300 feet. The initiative, dubbed "Zipotle," aims to enhance the customer experience and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy consumer base. The test will help determine the feasibility of expanding the service to other locations in the future.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is set to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after receiving a criminal referral from a Trump administration housing official. The referral, from FHFA Director Bill Pulte, accuses Cook of potential mortgage fraud related to claims of primary residence on two different properties. A DOJ attorney sent a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell urging him to fire Cook, though Powell lacks that authority. Cook has denied the allegations, stating she will not be bullied into resigning and is gathering information to answer any legitimate questions.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July from the previous month, defying analyst expectations for a decline. The increase is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Concurrently, housing inventory reached its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw only a minor 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point toward greater affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
