        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has responded to President Trump's accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement by asserting that the U.S. is the one undermining the consensus. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that the U.S. has taken steps that "seriously undermine" the deal reached in Geneva, referring to export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals, as well as the revocation of visas for Chinese students. The spokesperson vowed that Beijing would take measures to safeguard its interests if the U.S. continues to damage China's interests. Tensions between the two nations have escalated beyond trade, with the U.S. raising concerns about China's military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region, further complicating relations. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing disputes and lack of progress in reaching a stable agreement. </p>

Critics argue the vote will politicize the judiciary in a country already struggling with crime and gang violence.

A review by Universities UK suggests that greater collaboration between institutions could help address cost-cutting and efficiency issues. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible but enforces existing laws designed to promote competition. Some universities are already delivering courses collaboratively, benefiting students by allowing them to study locally. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation. </p>

A new report from the charity calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. The government says it is investing £1 billion in homelessness services this year to assist families trapped in temporary housing. The report highlights the struggles of families like Shanice Aird, who faces homelessness after rejecting unsuitable accommodation far from her children's school, and Felicity Afriyie, who has lived in temporary housing for 21 years. </p>
