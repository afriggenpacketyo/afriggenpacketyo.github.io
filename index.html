        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change aims to give people necessary time to grieve without resorting to sick leave. The exact length of the leave and eligibility details will be determined following a public consultation, a move praised by advocates as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched significant air strikes against Houthi-controlled ports and infrastructure in Yemen, including Hudaydah and Ras Issa. The operation, involving about 20 fighter jets, was a response to repeated Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israel. Israel claims the ports were used for Iranian weapons transfers and that a hijacked cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader, was repurposed by the Houthis for military surveillance. The Houthis reported confronting the attack and retaliated by launching their own barrage of missiles and drones toward Israeli cities, declaring their readiness for a prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>A Scottish paramedic, Stephen Doohan, has been sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to a woman pregnant with his child, causing a miscarriage. Doohan, who was married at the time, injected the drug into the woman at his home and also sexually assaulted her after giving her diazepam. The court heard he initially denied his actions before admitting he was "scared." The judge imposed a non-harassment order, noting the victim faces a lifetime of pain and loss from the "appalling case."</p>

          <p>Twelve Turkish soldiers have died after being exposed to methane gas while searching a cave in northern Iraq, according to Turkey's Defense Ministry. The soldiers were on a mission to recover the body of a comrade killed by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) fighters three years ago. The incident occurred in a cave previously used as a hospital by the PKK during Turkey's ongoing "Claw-Lock Operation" against the militant group. Several other soldiers affected by the gas were hospitalized, highlighting the persistent dangers faced by troops in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have led to at least 82 fatalities, with at least 41 people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically by 26 feet in under an hour, causing widespread destruction and prompting a major disaster declaration for Kerr County. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, involving over 160 air rescues, as officials work to account for everyone affected by the unprecedented storm. The rapid and severe nature of the flooding caught many residents and officials by surprise, leading to a large-scale, round-the-clock response.</p>

          <p>A White House economic adviser suggested that the Trump administration may delay imposing new tariffs on countries that are negotiating trade deals in good faith. With a deadline approaching, the administration is optimistic about securing several new agreements, but acknowledges that some discussions, such as those with Europe and India, may require more time. Countries not making sufficient concessions could face higher tariffs, with the final decision resting with the president. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers expressed skepticism, warning that such tariffs would likely lead to higher inflation for consumers and reduced competitiveness for American businesses.

The initiative is part of a larger effort, supported by the UK's water regulator, to modernize infrastructure management.

The government will have to defend its position that it can deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy.

He contends that while the fear of doxxing is real, masking creates greater dangers, such as public panic, mistaken identity by local police, and criminals impersonating law enforcement. The author emphasizes that policing in a free society requires transparency and courage, with officers being clearly identifiable.

          <p>A new economic analysis suggests that the traditional American model of suburban sprawl is facing a crisis, even in the historically affordable Sunbelt. Urban economists found that housing supply growth in metros like Phoenix and Atlanta has plummeted, mirroring trends seen in expensive coastal cities decades ago, leading to rising costs. The slowdown is particularly pronounced in affluent suburbs that resist densification, effectively closing the "suburban frontier."

          <p>UCLA and UC Berkeley are publicly sparring over which campus is the number one public university in the nation, using social media to stake their claims. The rivalry ignited after U.S. News & World Report released its global rankings, placing Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting celebratory posts from the campus. UCLA quickly countered by highlighting its own number one spot on a separate U.S. News national ranking for public universities, a title it has held for several years. The playful but competitive banter reflects the long-standing rivalry between the two top-tier California schools and highlights the differing methodologies of various college ranking systems.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump is methodically purifying the Republican party by forcing out or marginalizing any members who defy his agenda, citing the retirements of Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Don Bacon. The article contends that loyalty and obedience to Trump have become paramount, valued more than ideological consistency or the party's ability to win seats. This process, which has been ongoing for years, has replaced former critics with staunch loyalists. The author concludes that Trump's goal is not to build a majority but to cultivate a smaller, more compliant and mob-like political base.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced its most significant decline in decades, prompting concerns about America's long-term financial dominance. Analysts suggest that political instability, rising national debt, and unconventional policies like tariffs are shaking global investor confidence in the U.S. economy. While some see the weakening dollar as a natural market correction that could benefit U.S. exporters, others fear it signals a broader shift away from the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency. This trend could be accelerated by the rise of alternatives like the euro, yuan, or even cryptocurrencies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Cardano (ADA) explores the feasibility of a $10,000 investment growing to $1 million within the next decade, concluding it is highly improbable. For such a return, Cardano's market capitalization would need to reach over $2 trillion, rivaling Bitcoin's current value, a significant leap from its current standing. The article points to Cardano's low decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, thin liquidity, and slow development pace as major hurdles to achieving such exponential growth. A recent proposal to add Bitcoin to its treasury is seen as insufficient to address these fundamental challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Immigration rights advocates had fought the deportation, arguing the men could face torture or other harm, but federal judges ultimately allowed it to proceed.

However, many nutrition researchers argue these claims are overstated and that the science is being misrepresented. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can theoretically promote inflammation, human studies have not shown this to be a significant issue and instead link them to better heart health outcomes. Experts suggest the real problem is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, where these oils are prevalent, rather than the oils themselves when used in a balanced diet.</p>
