            <p>An Israeli military investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month concluded there were "professional failures" and that a deputy commander will be dismissed. The investigation found that the deputy commander misidentified ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants due to poor visibility, despite video evidence showing the vehicles had flashing lights and visible logos. The incident occurred during operations in Rafah, where troops bulldozed over the bodies and vehicles, burying them in a mass grave, and the investigation asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members, though the Civil Defense is part of the Hamas-run government. The findings have been turned over to the Military Advocate General for potential charges.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to investigate the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident allegedly affiliated with MS-13, despite a court order prohibiting his removal. Van Hollen emphasized that his mission was to uphold the rule of law and ensure due process, not to defend Abrego Garcia. He criticized the Trump administration and El Salvador’s President Bukele for their handling of the case, noting that Abrego Garcia was initially held in the notorious CECOT prison without communication. Van Hollen also addressed concerns about the Salvadoran authorities attempting to stage the meeting, emphasizing his goal was to ensure Abrego Garcia's well-being and communicate with his family.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project to mitigate the impact of President Trump's tariffs and secure trade deals. The project, involving an 800-mile pipeline and a liquefaction plant, aims to export natural gas to Asia. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the project's potential role in trade negotiations, and Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas. The Alaska LNG project aligns with Trump's agenda for U.S. energy dominance and could provide a more efficient route for LNG exports to Asia.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry attributed the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding," stating troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces. The IDF said poor night visibility contributed to the commander's failure to identify the vehicles as ambulances, though video evidence later surfaced showing the vehicles with lights and emergency signals on. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The IDF also claimed that six of the casualties were Hamas members, but did not provide specific evidence for this affiliation.</p>

Authorities believe the fire was ignited by cooking onboard the vessel, which was carrying approximately 400 passengers.

            <p>The CEO of Back Market reports a tripling of sales following President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting Americans may increasingly opt for used or refurbished tech devices. With potential price increases on new electronics due to tariffs, consumers have a greater incentive to save money. Prolonged tariffs could lead to a significant rise in short-term sales of used devices, particularly smartphones, although analysts believe many consumers will eventually return to buying new tech when affordable. The future of the tariffs is uncertain, as they could last days, weeks, or months, or never take effect at all.</p>

Recent reports from Walmart, Amazon, JPMorgan, and Paychex indicate a fundamentally healthy economy, but the author advises closely monitoring future earnings releases for signs of cracks forming.

            <p>A 14-year-old girl was killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, prompting the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to deploy search teams and set a trap for the animal. The girl was snatched from a residential compound on a ranch next to Nairobi National Park. This incident follows another where a 54-year-old man was killed by an elephant in central Nyeri county. Conservation groups are urging KWS to improve risk assessments and communication of wildlife movement in high-risk areas.</p>

            <p>German authorities are seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens for their alleged involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, specifically related to a demonstration at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. The individuals, including two from Ireland, one from Poland, and one from the United States, have been ordered to leave Germany by April 21. The deportation orders are based on allegations of property damage and graffiti during the protest, although none of the individuals have been formally charged or convicted of any crime. This action has drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of similar protests in the U.S.</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over alleged actions at protests against Israel's war in Gaza, with orders instructing them to leave Germany by April 21.

Critics have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's handling of pro-Palestinian student protesters in the U.S. Those served with deportation orders say they have no information about charges, and their lawyer says none have criminal convictions and haven't been given court dates or other information about the charges against them.</p>

            <p>The article provides strategies for protecting savings from market volatility caused by tariffs as retirement approaches. These include rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance, building cash reserves to avoid selling investments during market downturns, and considering a "bond ladder" to generate consistent income. Experts emphasize the importance of avoiding selling investments when the stock market is down, especially during the first few years of retirement, to mitigate the impact of sequence of returns risk. The article also suggests maintaining two years of income in cash.</p>

            <p>The author recounts a story from 30 years ago when she lied on a first date, claiming to drive a Land Rover despite knowing nothing about cars. The article explores the prevalence and motivations behind dating lies, categorizing them as attempts at kindness, politeness, or stemming from insecurity. While egregious lies causing harm are unacceptable, the author suggests that lesser dating lies, born out of wishful thinking or attempts to be a better version of oneself, might merit a compassionate blind eye. The author's date eventually found out about the lie but it did not end the relationship.</p>

            <p>Kansas City, Missouri, is experiencing widespread pain from cuts implemented by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Promised funds for public health, environmental programs, and food aid have been slashed, jeopardizing thousands of local jobs. The federal government is the largest employer in the region, and these cuts are impacting various sectors, including the IRS, urban farming initiatives, and the local health department. One example is an HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient.</p>
