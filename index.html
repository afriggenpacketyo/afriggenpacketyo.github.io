          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators have gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The event, a significant celebration of Protestant culture and Ulster-Scots heritage, features marches in cities like Belfast, Coleraine, and Keady. Officials, including the Reverend Mervyn Gibson of the Orange Order, have described the day as peaceful and successful, highlighting it as a positive expression of cultural identity. The parades, which also include visiting lodges from Scotland, are a long-standing tradition involving marching bands and large crowds.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded his week by visiting Central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic floods that have claimed over 120 lives, expressing the nation's grief and promising federal support. Earlier in the week, he held meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, signaling that a ceasefire agreement with Hamas could be imminent to secure peace and the return of hostages. During a cabinet meeting, the president also addressed various topics, including Elon Musk's proposal for a new political party and his growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals FEMA Removed Camp Mystic Buildings from Flood Maps Prior to Deadly Deluge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 11:09:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of federal records shows that FEMA repeatedly approved requests to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map in the years leading up to the deadly Texas flood. This re-designation loosened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the girls' summer camp, which was operating and expanding in a known hazardous flood plain. At least 27 campers and counselors died when the Guadalupe River surged. Experts find it disturbing that a camp responsible for children would seek such exemptions, though FEMA has downplayed the significance of the map amendments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced new 30% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, set to take effect on August 1. In letters to the leaders of both trading partners, the administration cited the need to address the large U.S. trade deficit with the EU and Mexico's insufficient efforts to stop cartel-related fentanyl trafficking. The move has been met with concern from both the EU and Mexico, who have indicated they will work toward an agreement but are prepared to implement proportionate countermeasures if necessary.

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence dating assistants to improve their chances on dating apps. Services like Rizz and Keepler analyze conversation screenshots and suggest replies, helping users break the ice or navigate difficult conversations. While some users find the AI coaching to be a confidence booster and a useful tool for initiating contact, the trend raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest such tools can be helpful as a supplement, but caution against using them as a substitute for genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>A political commentary piece suggests that Eric and Lara Trump are stepping into the political vacuum left by Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, with both showing signs of significant political ambition. Eric Trump has hinted at a potential future presidential run, while Lara Trump has already served as co-chair of the Republican National Committee and is reportedly considering a 2026 Senate bid in North Carolina. The article portrays Lara as taking on the role of softening Donald Trump's image, a position previously occupied by Ivanka, positioning the couple for future influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a negotiation expert, successfully securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and is more likely to be a process that unfolds over several weeks. It is advised to initiate compensation discussions during a mid-year check-in rather than at an annual review, when budgets are often already set. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get a final agreement. Following up, documenting the conversation, and being patient are key to a collaborative and ultimately successful negotiation.</p>

          <p>A sex and psychotherapy expert warns that many couples underestimate the importance of intimacy and allow common habits to damage their connection. Four major "intimacy blockers" are identified: excessive phone use which signals a lack of presence, unresolved feelings about an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias, and an unmanaged stress response. The therapist advises couples to set screen-time boundaries, work towards emotional closure from past relationships, challenge negative thoughts, and communicate openly about how stress affects their desire for connection.</p>

          <p>An article argues that modern children are increasingly deprived of free, unstructured physical play, which is crucial for their development. This "self-domestication" and societal pressure for kids to "behave" stifles the natural, animal-like movement that builds healthier bones, muscles, and cognitive skills. Injury-prevention experts suggest that allowing children to climb, run, and wrestle helps them develop a robust "movement vocabulary," making them less prone to injury later in life. Parents are encouraged to overcome fears of minor injuries to provide their children with these essential developmental experiences.</p>

These informal guidelines include not displaying foreign flags or Spanish-language stickers, listening only to English-language radio, and avoiding work uniforms or vans associated with immigrant labor. The fear is pervasive in the community, regardless of legal status, as many report knowing someone who was recently stopped and is now facing deportation, leading some to avoid driving altogether.</p>

Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs and experimenting with removing them to free up money, time, and mental energy for goals like paying off debt or investing.</p>
