          <p>Six people were injured in what the FBI is calling a "targeted act of violence" at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. Witnesses reported that the suspect, identified as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine." The victims, ranging in age from 67 to 88, sustained burns, with one in critical condition, and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism. The attack prompted evacuations and a multi-agency investigation, with officials denouncing the hate-filled act. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation and concern within the community. The tone of the article is grave, given the nature of the event. </p>

          <p>Nearly 1,000 people gathered at Main Beach in Santa Cruz, California, for a Pride Month protest aimed at President Donald Trump. Participants formed a human banner that spelled out "Resist!" in rainbow colors, but the event also featured the message "86 47," which many interpreted as a call to "get rid of" the 47th President of the United States. Critics say that the message crossed a line, while supporters claim it was a symbolic rejection of Trump’s agenda. The event promoted "kindness" and inclusivity, but the imagery told a more conflicted story. The article reflects the divided political climate.</p>

          <p>Ukraine executed its largest long-range attack of the war, using smuggled drones to strike 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases, according to Ukrainian sources. The SBU security service organized the "Spider's Web" operation, which took a year and a half to plan and involved 117 drones, each with its own pilot, as stated by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia confirmed the attacks, calling them a "terrorist act," and reported that some aircraft caught fire in five regions. The Ukrainian claims have not been independently verified, and expectations for the upcoming peace talks in Istanbul remain low. The events described are tragic and concerning.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was attending the University of Michigan, has fled the U.S. after being charged with voting illegally in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote despite not being a citizen, leading to state charges.

He now faces federal charges of flight to avoid prosecution, though the U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with China.

Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare bad start, and the Dodgers made costly mistakes on defense and basepaths, while the offense struggled against Ryan Yarbrough. The Yankees capitalized on Yamamoto's inability to consistently find the strike zone, scoring multiple runs in the early innings. Despite some late-game home runs, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the deficit, resulting in another momentum-halting loss in an inconsistent season. The team's performance was disappointing.</p>

          <p>Students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, according to a new report. A government review is underway in England regarding higher education funding, and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration where possible given the challenging financial situation. The Universities UK report found institutions are reluctant to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws. Sir Nigel Carrington suggests neighboring universities should be allowed to agree on which courses to offer to prevent a lack of opportunity for students to study desired subjects in their home regions. The article expresses concern for the future of higher education.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs, due to widespread family displacement across the country. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England. Analysis suggests almost 94,000 children in London are living in temporary accommodation.

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, drawing criticism from US President Donald Trump. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, but critics argue it threatens property rights. The law will be used in rare circumstances for "public interest", such as land reform, and may involve less compensation than market value. The government hopes the law will make it easier to acquire land and settle land claims, but experts doubt its implementation due to the political cost. The article presents a detailed analysis of the controversial law.</p>
