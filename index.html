          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, America's only operational rare earth mining company, through a $400 million investment. This strategic move aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China. The funding will support the expansion of MP Materials' processing capabilities and the construction of a new magnet manufacturing facility, with the Pentagon guaranteeing purchases for a decade. The news caused the company's stock to surge significantly in premarket trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At its recent seminar, OPEC ministers and industry leaders focused on three key energy topics: the green transition, the future oil outlook, and production capacity. Officials advocated for continued investment in hydrocarbons to ensure energy security during the gradual shift to renewables, a stance critics label as greenwashing. The group released its 2050 World Oil Outlook, projecting sustained demand growth driven by developing economies. Ministers also reiterated calls for massive long-term investment in the oil and gas sector to boost dwindling spare capacity and meet future energy needs.</p>

          <p>A whistleblower has provided Congress with text messages and emails allegedly showing that judicial nominee Emil Bove urged a Justice Department lawyer to defy a court order. The messages concern the mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and the subsequent pressure to ignore a judge's mandate for his return. Former DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni, who was fired after the incident, claims Bove gave instructions to communicate a dismissive message to the court. These revelations emerge just before a committee vote on Bove's controversial nomination to a federal appeals court, which he has denied.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have declared a major incident over a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, following a request from the city council to dismantle it. The structure's proximity to a major electricity substation has raised serious concerns about the power supply to two nearby hospitals. While bonfire builders voluntarily removed some material as a goodwill gesture, tensions have escalated over the potential police intervention. The situation highlights the cultural and political complexities surrounding the traditional bonfires, which commemorate the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel without pay for periods ranging from 10 to 42 days following the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump in Pennsylvania. An agency official stated the suspensions were part of an accountability process for the operational failure but emphasized a focus on fixing systemic deficiencies rather than simply firing staff. A bipartisan House report had previously identified significant lapses in leadership, training, and coordination. The agency has since introduced new technologies like drones and mobile command posts to prevent future security breaches.</p>

The legislation expands work requirements to older individuals and parents of teenagers, and imposes new financial burdens on states for payment errors.

          <p>A large-scale manhunt in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest for Travis Decker, a fugitive accused of killing his three daughters, has concluded after authorities located the subject and confirmed it was a case of mistaken identity. The search was initiated after a family reported seeing a man who closely resembled Decker. After several days of searching, investigators found and interviewed the man, a cooperative hiker who was not the fugitive. Decker has been wanted since June after his daughters' bodies were found at a campground in Washington state.</p>

          <p>China has offered a rare glimpse into the production facilities for its fifth-generation stealth fighters, providing a subtle hint about their future deployment on aircraft carriers. During a state television segment focused on the upgraded J-15T carrier-based fighter, the unmentioned J-35 stealth aircraft was visible in the background. A test pilot discussed the technical challenges of designing aircraft for catapult-assisted launches, a feature of China's newest aircraft carrier. The appearance suggests that China is advancing its naval aviation capabilities with next-generation technology.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the Catholic bishop of San Bernardino, California, has granted a dispensation exempting parishioners from the obligation to attend Mass if they have a genuine fear of immigration enforcement actions. Bishop Alberto Rojas stated that such fear constitutes a "grave inconvenience" that could impede the spiritual well-being of the faithful. This decree appears to be the first of its kind linked to immigration raids, which have reportedly occurred in sensitive locations like churches since the Trump administration revoked policies limiting them. The diocese is one of the largest in the U.S., serving about 1.6 million Catholics.</p>

          <p>The recent military conflict between Israel and Iran has dangerously escalated the precarious situation for the approximately 9,000 Jews still living in Iran. Following Israeli bombing raids, Iranian authorities have reportedly detained dozens of Jewish citizens, warning them against contact with relatives abroad. This paranoia over internal enemies marks a potential shift from the regime's long-standing, albeit tense, policy of distinguishing between Iranian Jews and Zionists. The increased threat has renewed a sense of urgency for many to leave, a prospect complicated by the Trump administration's halt on most refugee admissions.</p>

          <p>A Houston pediatrician has issued a public apology after losing her job over a social media post concerning the deadly Texas floods. Dr. Christina Propst wrote she was "deeply sorry" for a comment suggesting that voters in the Trump-supporting Kerr County "get what they voted for," referencing their denial of climate change and support for gutting FEMA. The post was made before the full scale of the tragedy, which killed nearly 120 people, was known. Her employer, Blue Fish Pediatrics, stated the comment did not reflect its values and announced she was no longer an employee.</p>

The call for action follows the release of text messages from the acting school president suggesting Shendelman's removal from the board.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that Iran poses a persistent and increasingly unpredictable threat to British national security. The Intelligence and Security Committee's report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings against UK-based individuals, primarily regime opponents, since early 2022. The report accuses the government of focusing too much on crisis management and the nuclear issue at the expense of other threats. It urges a more strategic, long-term approach and considers the proscription of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist group.</p>

          <p>Temperatures are set to soar across the UK, peaking this weekend with highs of 34C (93.2F) possible on Friday and Saturday. This marks the third official heatwave of the year for some regions, prompting the UK Health Security Agency to extend yellow heat-health alerts for all of England. The Met Office defines a heatwave by a region-specific temperature threshold being met for at least three consecutive days. The sweltering conditions have also led to an "extreme wildfire warning" in Scotland, as the heat is expected to continue into early next week before cooler weather arrives.</p>

The hacks involved stealing vast amounts of customer and staff data and deploying ransomware, costing M&S an estimated £300m in lost profits.

He positioned China as a reliable partner for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), encouraging the bloc not to compromise the interests of others in their trade negotiations with the United States.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vowed to impose matching tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration follows through on its threat to levy a 50% import tax on Brazil. President Trump cited the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whom he called a "highly respected leader," as a reason for the proposed tariff hike. Lula rejected the demand to end the trial, asserting Brazil's sovereignty and independent judiciary. The trade dispute adds a political dimension to Trump's broader tariff strategy, with the U.S. being Brazil's second-largest trade partner.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer goods, including appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Copper is a critical metal used in everything from electrical wiring and plumbing to military hardware and renewable energy components. Economists warn that the hefty tariff will inevitably be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to incentivize domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign imports for a material vital to national and economic security.
