          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its 10th test flight, following two days of delays. The Super Heavy booster performed a planned splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast, while the Starship upper stage reached a suborbital trajectory as intended, heading for a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This critical test aims to work out bugs for future operational missions, including launching Starlink satellites and eventually carrying astronauts to the moon for NASA and settlers to Mars. Despite past failures, this flight showed promising progress, crucial for the vehicle's ambitious long-term goals.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler has accepted a plea deal in a Tennessee court, resulting in a four-day jail sentence, a $350 fine, and one year of unsupervised probation for driving under the influence. The agreement also led to the dismissal of a weapon possession charge, though he must forfeit his gun found in his truck. Cutler was arrested last October after allegedly hitting another vehicle in Franklin, Tennessee, with officers noting slurred speech and his refusal of field sobriety tests. His driver's license has been revoked, and he must attend a DUI safety class as part of his sentence, concluding the legal proceedings for the former professional athlete.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel announced it will revert to its beloved "Old Timer" logo featuring Uncle Hershel, following significant public backlash to a recent modern redesign. The company stated it listened to customer feedback, which had critiqued the simplified text-only logo and updated store aesthetics. Even former President Donald Trump weighed in, urging the company to reverse its decision. This move underscores the strong emotional connection customers have with the brand's traditional imagery and country hospitality, demonstrating the power of consumer sentiment in corporate branding.</p>

The article highlights SpaceX's "fail fast, learn fast" development approach, which contrasts with rivals, but acknowledges the immense technical hurdles remaining, such as in-orbit refueling and developing a fully reusable heat shield, crucial for its ambitious lunar and Martian colonization goals.</p>

          <p>Grocery giant Kroger is laying off nearly 1,000 corporate employees as part of a business restructuring aimed at trimming costs and simplifying its model. This decision follows a series of setbacks, including a failed merger with Albertsons last year and the abrupt resignation of its former CEO. While the company faces increasing pressure from competitors and its e-commerce business remains unprofitable, its shares have risen over the last 12 months, indicating investor confidence in its strategic adjustments. The affected individuals are corporate staff, not those in stores or distribution centers.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell on Wednesday, despite overnight gains on Wall Street, with India's markets particularly under scrutiny as new U.S. tariffs take effect. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both slipped, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw a slight gain. The U.S. tariffs of up to 50% on Indian exports are a response to India's substantial Russian energy imports, a move that is expected to significantly impact various sectors. Overnight, Wall Street's S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all closed higher, looking past President Trump's removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday's youthful team secured a surprising 3-0 penalty shootout victory over Premier League rivals Leeds in the Carabao Cup, following a 1-1 draw. This triumph occurred despite ongoing fan protests against owner Dejphon Chansiri due to the club's financial turmoil and delayed wage payments. Manager Henrik Pedersen praised his players' "togetherness," a sentiment echoed by observers who noted the unity between the team and a portion of the boycotting supporters. The win provides a morale boost amidst significant off-field challenges and pressure on the club's management.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador and recently rearrested in the U.S., have filed an emergency motion to reopen his immigration case to seek asylum. They argue that his return to the U.S. makes him eligible for asylum and that he fears persecution and torture if deported to Uganda or El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. The defense also seeks to designate Costa Rica, which has offered him refugee status, as his country of removal. This legal battle highlights alleged vindictive prosecution and the complexities of international immigration law.</p>

          <p>The NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law have filed a lawsuit against Texas, alleging that the state's newly redrawn congressional maps constitute racial gerrymandering. The suit claims these maps unlawfully reduce the political power of Black voters and violate the U.S. Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Texas Republicans passed the map, expecting to gain five congressional seats. This legal challenge underscores a broader national battle over redistricting, with Republicans hoping to overturn key sections of the Voting Rights Act, potentially impacting minority representation across the country.</p>

          <p>Decades of dedicated conservation efforts have significantly increased the population of the endangered golden snub-nosed monkey in China's Shennongjia National Park, from under 500 to over 1,600. Professor Yang Jingyuan, director of the park's research institute, has spent his career understanding and protecting these unique primates, whose habitat was once threatened by logging and hunting. The success is attributed to forest protection, community involvement by turning former farmers into rangers, and a painstaking year-long process to habituate a monkey group to human presence. The park aims to reach over 2,000 monkeys within a decade.</p>

Just weeks before the event, former navy chief of staff Li Hanjun was removed from his legislative role due to suspected "serious violations of discipline and law." While some question if this anti-corruption drive hampers war readiness, others argue it reflects President Xi Jinping's commitment to building a "capable of winning wars" force.

          <p>The Trump administration's cancellation of over 5,000 foreign-aid projects has led to a "fire sale" of USAID assets, including mosquito nets, medical equipment, and vehicles, with items being auctioned off, abandoned, or destroyed. This chaotic closeout, with little guidance from leadership, is resulting in millions of dollars in losses and potential national security concerns if equipment falls into the wrong hands. Projects providing crucial services, like schools for girls in Afghanistan and clean water initiatives, have been left unfinished. The shutdown is estimated to cost the federal government billions annually, undermining humanitarian efforts and U.S. global commitments.</p>
