          <h2>US and China Engage in High-Stakes Trade Negotiations to Ease Tensions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions stemming from President Trump's trade war, which involves tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese imports and 125 percent on American products. These levies have disrupted global supply chains, prompting American companies to seek alternative sourcing and Chinese factories to explore ways around the tariffs. Economists warn that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation, potentially leading to a U.S. recession. While Trump hailed initial conversations as successful, skepticism remains regarding the likelihood of a quick resolution.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, challenges the notion of the perfect mother and argues that flaws are essential for raising well-adjusted children. She posits that children learn to accept their own imperfections by witnessing their caregivers' flaws. Ross also points out the historical tendency of psychiatrists to unfairly blame mothers for their children's problems, urging a shift towards recognizing the immense credit mothers deserve. The article encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and embrace their imperfections, highlighting that being good enough is sufficient.</p>

          <p>Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, has returned to Boston after being released from an immigration detention center in Louisiana, where she was held for over six weeks. Her detention followed an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing Tufts' response to Israel and the war in Gaza. A federal judge ordered her release pending a final decision on her claim of illegal detention, finding substantial claims that her rights were violated. Öztürk plans to continue her case in the courts, asserting her faith in the American justice system, while Senator Ed Markey praised her resilience in fighting her case.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has chosen Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership initially sought to replace Kim due to concerns about his electability, but PPP members voted against the motion, reinstating Kim as the candidate. This decision follows a period of turmoil within the PPP since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine to be held in Turkey, brushing aside demands from European leaders for a 30-day cease-fire. This announcement followed a joint visit by leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland to Ukraine, where they threatened Russia with new sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if a full cease-fire was not agreed upon. Putin stated Russia is prepared for serious negotiations without preconditions and proposed a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, although he did not commit to halting military actions before then. Ukraine has not immediately responded, but attacks by Russian exploding drones were reported shortly after Putin's statement.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's public plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter divisions within the British royal family, potentially overshadowing the king's reign. The plea, made in a BBC interview, has drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when Harry and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Some royal observers warn that Charles' inability to heal this rift could negatively impact his reign and undermine the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness he has long promoted. The palace has pushed back against Harry's claims regarding security arrangements, further fueling the public drama.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf ahead of a Middle East trip has ignited widespread anger and unity among Iranians across political and ideological divides.

Trump's suggestion has drawn condemnation from Iranian government officials, analysts, and even opposition figures, who see it as an insult to Iranian history and civilization.

          <p>President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor Eric Adams offer conflicting accounts of their recent meeting at the White House. While Adams stated that he discussed important issues for New York City, including investments for manufacturing, Trump suggested that Adams' visit was primarily to thank him. The details of the meeting remain unclear, and the contrasting narratives highlight the complex relationship between the city and the federal government.</p>

          <p>Actor Danny Dyer has revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani was the deciding factor in his decision to continue treatment at a rehab facility in 2016. Dyer, who was struggling with drug use and the pressures of fame, said he was ready to leave rehab but changed his mind after reading the letter. He says the letter from Dani made him reflect on the pain he'd caused his family and commit to continuing his treatment at the facility in South Africa. The actor says looking back is "awful" and that his days of "hedonism" and "mad behaviour" are over.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen studying at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released from federal custody, expressing joy and gratitude while maintaining faith in American democracy. Ozturk, who was detained for six weeks, thanked supporters for their kindness and expressed love for the country that imprisoned her. She had written an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, which her supporters say led to her detention. A federal judge said Ozturk's detention would potentially chill the speech of millions of non-citizens in the country.</p>

Concerns heightened after explosions hit a key Pakistani air base near the country's nuclear command, prompting fears of a potential nuclear escalation.

Speaking at a town hall in Pennsylvania, Gallego argued that the party's focus on purity has led to the exclusion of individuals like Joe Rogan, hindering their ability to win elections. He emphasized the need to engage with diverse perspectives, even those with whom they may not fully agree, to effectively represent and win support in battleground states.
