        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>North Carolina state senators have passed a new congressional map designed to shift a Democratic-held House district, making it more favorable to Republicans. This move aims to increase the GOP's chances of maintaining House control in next year's midterms, potentially flipping a seat currently held by moderate Rep. Don Davis. The state's Democratic governor has limited veto power, suggesting the map is likely to clear the North Carolina House. This redistricting effort is part of a broader national trend by Republican-led states to redraw boundaries that boost GOP electoral prospects.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for its criminal investigations into his 2016 campaign and his retention of classified documents. These claims were submitted through an administrative process that often precedes lawsuits. Trump indicated that any settlement would need approval from DOJ officials, including some he appointed, raising significant conflict of interest concerns. He stated he would donate any received money to charity, while his legal team described the investigations as "Democrat-led Witch Hunts."</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a Capitol rioter pardoned by President Trump, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan reportedly sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries at a New York City event. He faces a felony charge of making a terroristic threat, prompting Jeffries to highlight concerns about recidivism among pardoned Jan. 6 defendants. This incident is part of a growing trend of threats against legislators, with Capitol Police reporting over 14,000 investigations in 2025.</p>

          <p>A Senate Caucus hearing highlighted Hezbollah's increasing presence in Venezuela, with lawmakers from both parties expressing concern over the Maduro regime's alleged role in providing safe haven and facilitating illicit activities like drug trafficking. Senator Bernie Moreno, a Republican, predicted that President Trump would move to end Nicolás Maduro’s rule, suggesting regime change in Caracas is "long past due." Experts testified that Venezuela has become a critical enabler for Hezbollah in Latin America, linking it to a global "axis of evasion" network.

          <p>Six individuals were arrested in Dublin after a violent protest outside the Citywest Hotel, which houses asylum seekers, saw police attacked with bricks, fireworks, and glass bottles. A police vehicle was also set ablaze, and protesters attempted to breach a cordon using horse-drawn carts and tools. Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly condemned the "thuggery" against officers, with one sustaining a foot injury. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin and Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan denounced the violence, emphasizing that such actions do not represent the local community.</p>

          <p>Federal agents, including ICE and other partners, conducted a targeted operation on New York City's Canal Street in Chinatown, focusing on criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods.

City Hall officials monitored the situation, stating they do not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters. Mayor Eric Adams' office emphasized that undocumented New Yorkers pursuing the American Dream should not be targets, but rather violent criminals.</p>

His teammates celebrated his return to scoring form, highlighting the squad's unity. Arteta believes Gyokeres' physical play and ability to create space make Arsenal a "much better team," anticipating a more prolific spell for the striker.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, is suing House Speaker Mike Johnson to compel the swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who won a special election in September. Grijalva's seating is crucial as she would be the 218th signature needed for a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. Johnson has delayed her swearing-in, citing the ongoing government shutdown, but critics suggest it's to prevent the Epstein files vote. Mayes argues that blocking Grijalva disenfranchises Arizona's seventh congressional district and obstructs justice for Epstein survivors.</p>

          <p>Netflix shares dropped approximately 7% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, attributing the weaker-than-estimated results to an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. The streamer incurred a $619 million expense from a 10% tax on payments to operations outside Brazil, which was not previously forecasted. Despite the miss, revenue rose 17% year-over-year, in line with expectations, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue. This article notes that Netflix also posted its best ad sales quarter ever and expects continued revenue growth in Q4. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mattel reported third-quarter results that missed Wall Street estimates, with shares falling 4% due to declining North American sales. This decline, particularly in infant and preschool categories, is attributed to shifts in retailer ordering and Trump administration tariffs. Despite this, international sales grew 3%, and CEO Ynon Kreiz noted improving US orders since Q4 began.

          <p>The upcoming September consumer price index (CPI) report is drawing attention, but also skepticism from financial markets due to the ongoing government shutdown and prior scrutiny of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data collection methods.

This article notes that the BLS was recalled specifically because the CPI report is vital for Social Security adjustments, making it one of the few data releases during the shutdown.
