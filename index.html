          <p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket successfully launched an upgraded Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station, delivering over five tons of essential supplies, research materials, and special holiday treats for the crew. This mission marks the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman, featuring the new Cygnus XL model, which is significantly longer and offers about 2,600 additional pounds of cargo capacity. The Falcon 9's first stage executed a spectacular and successful return landing at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, marking SpaceX's 67th Florida touchdown and 505th overall booster recovery. This critical resupply ensures the ISS maintains vital reserves, including components for the urine processor and diverse food items like clams, oysters, and roast turkey, while contributing to ongoing space exploration efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally requested $58 million from Congress to significantly enhance security for the executive and judicial branches, a move prompted by the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The funds are specifically earmarked for the U.S. Marshals Service and will include bolstered protection for Supreme Court justices. While expressing support for increased security for congressional lawmakers, the administration is allowing the legislative branch to determine its own funding needs. This request underscores growing concerns over political violence and rising threats against public officials, with U.S. Capitol Police anticipating over 14,000 threats to members by year-end, signaling a heightened security posture.</p>

          <p>Country singer Gavin Adcock publicly accused Zach Bryan of being a "not very good person" following a heated confrontation at the Born & Raised Festival in Oklahoma. Adcock shared videos showing Bryan yelling and climbing over a fence to confront him, asserting that Bryan had been "treating guests like dog sh**" and actively sought a fight before Adcock's scheduled performance. Adcock explained he avoided physical altercation to prevent potential legal repercussions and disappointing his fans, suggesting Bryan deliberately staged the incident for self-promotion. This public spat adds to previous online criticisms Adcock made against Bryan regarding his interactions with young fans, intensifying their public feud.</p>

          <p>UCLA Athletic Director Martin Jarmond faces significant criticism after firing football coach DeShaun Foster just one season into his tenure, following a disappointing 5-15 record. This article argues that Jarmond previously made poor decisions by not dismissing Chip Kelly sooner and then hastily hiring Foster, who was largely unqualified for a head coaching role. Despite Jarmond's successes in other sports, his handling of the football program is seen as a major failure, jeopardizing the university's most lucrative and nationally visible asset. The chancellor, Julio Frenk, is now urged to prevent Jarmond from selecting the next football coach, given his repeated missteps and apparent reluctance to take full responsibility for these critical errors.</p>

This growing issue, where the average negative equity is $6,754, is largely attributed to consumers opting for longer loan terms, such as 84-month loans now comprising over 21% of new auto loans, and making smaller down payments. This financial burden complicates new car purchases, as drivers must either cover the outstanding balance or roll it into their next loan. Experts recommend consumers retain their current vehicles if feasible, thoroughly research their credit scores, secure pre-approvals from multiple lenders, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance to mitigate risks in case of an accident.

          <p>A BBC investigation has identified Charles Mwesigwa as the alleged orchestrator of a degrading sexual assault ring operating in Dubai's affluent neighborhoods, exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women. These women were reportedly lured with false promises of legitimate work in the UAE, only to find themselves ensnared in debt and compelled to perform extreme sexual acts for wealthy clients, including the infamous "porta potty" requests. The article further reveals the suspicious deaths of two women linked to Mwesigwa, who fell from high-rise apartments, with their deaths ruled suicides despite pleas from family and friends for more thorough police investigations. Mwesigwa denies all allegations, claiming he merely helps women find accommodation and connects them with wealthy contacts, yet the report exposes a broader, unofficial pipeline of exploitation between Uganda and the Gulf states.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have unveiled five new commercial deals in nuclear power, heralding a "golden age" for the sector just before President Trump's state visit. Key initiatives include plans for a new 960MW advanced modular reactor (AMR) plant in Hartlepool, a collaboration between US firm X-Energy and British Gas-owner Centrica, projected to generate 2,500 construction jobs. Separately, EDF and US nuclear firm Holtec are exploring an £11bn project for SMR-powered data centers in Nottinghamshire. The newly formed Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to accelerate these projects by cutting red tape and standardizing safety protocols. Both governments are heavily investing in nuclear to satisfy escalating electricity demand, particularly from the AI industry, and to bolster energy security while achieving climate targets.</p>

Serving from 1990 to 1998, Edgar is widely recognized for steering the state toward greater financial stability during a challenging 1990s recession. His tenure involved advocating for significant budget cuts and successfully making a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, which provided a stable funding source for public education. A moderate figure within the Republican party, Edgar later expressed discomfort with its rightward shift, notably endorsing Kamala Harris for president last year.

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy contends that Manchester United's ongoing struggles are primarily due to player selection and positioning within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation, rather than the system itself. Murphy observes improvements in the team's compactness and defensive structure, yet emphasizes that individual mistakes are consistently leading to goals against them. He points to Bruno Fernandes, an exceptional number 10, being played in a deeper central midfield role where his defensive instincts are insufficient, and Luke Shaw being shoehorned into a center-back position. Murphy argues that while the system shows potential, the manager's failure to place players in roles where they are fully comfortable and effective is causing critical errors to accumulate, suggesting that continued misplacement of personnel will prevent the team from achieving consistent success.</p>

Kim Jong Un's significant return to the world stage, his first multilateral international appearance since the COVID-19 pandemic, underscored the idea that aligning with Beijing can offer diplomatic legitimacy and rehabilitation without the prerequisite of reform or denuclearization.

A recent Supreme Court decision, authorizing federal agents to conduct "roving patrols" based on minimal suspicion, has amplified anxieties within the Latino community. Although the parade's attendance seemed reduced compared to previous years, participants actively expressed their resolve to fight for their rights, prominently displaying anti-Trump and anti-ICE signage. The event, a vibrant celebration of Latino joy and cultural heritage, also featured public figures like Mayor Karen Bass, who reiterated strong support for immigrant communities and condemned the ongoing raids, which many leaders argue are discriminatory and detrimental to the region's economy.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a tragic increase in maternal and infant deaths across Afghanistan, directly attributing this crisis to the closure of over 400 medical facilities following the Trump administration's abrupt cessation of nearly all US aid. The article shares heartbreaking personal accounts, including that of Shahnaz, who, along with her baby, died in childbirth after discovering her local USAID-supported clinic was shut down. The US government justified these aid cuts by citing "credible and longstanding concerns" that funds were benefiting terrorist groups, including the Taliban, a claim the Taliban vehemently denies. These closures, exacerbated by the Taliban's severe restrictions on women's education and medical training, have critically limited access to essential healthcare, placing countless Afghan women's lives at profound and immediate risk.</p>

Despite this widespread consumer adoption, major banks and credit card companies harbor significant wariness towards BNPL services. These financial institutions see BNPL as a direct challenge to their traditional credit offerings, as every purchase financed through BNPL is a transaction that bypasses credit cards, thereby reducing their transaction activity, utilization, and major revenue streams. Furthermore, BNPL loans represent a "giant black hole" in the credit profile, complicating their understanding of consumer credit quality and overall financial risk, a concern that intensifies as the user base expands.

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana cycling race in Madrid was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters extensively disrupted the course, knocking down barriers and occupying key roads, leading to clashes with police. Despite the deployment of over 1,000 officers, the situation necessitated the race's early termination, preventing a podium ceremony. Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard was declared the overall winner, but expressed regret that the celebratory moment was "taken from us." These protests, which have caused multiple disruptions throughout the race, specifically targeted the Israeli-owned Premier Tech team. Spanish Prime Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez's public admiration for the protesters drew sharp criticism from Madrid's mayor and Israel's foreign minister, highlighting the intense political tensions surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has disclosed that Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is refusing to cooperate with authorities, though investigators are actively gathering information from his family and friends. Cox indicated that Robinson, despite coming from a conservative background, held "very different" left-leaning political beliefs and was in a romantic relationship with a transgender partner. While the governor refrained from confirming the partner's identity as a direct motive, he emphasized the ongoing investigation into Robinson's potential radicalization through "deep, dark internet culture." Notably, bullet casings found near the crime scene bore inscriptions with anti-fascist and meme-culture messages, providing further context for the ongoing inquiry into the complex motivations behind the attack.</p>

          <p>Utah's recently enacted HB 128, which permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses, is facing renewed scrutiny in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The law, which became effective in August, overturned a prior requirement for firearms to be concealed on university grounds. University staff had previously raised concerns regarding the potential implications for classroom emergencies and the presence of weapons in laboratories containing hazardous chemicals. While the legality of the suspect's firearm possession at the university remains unconfirmed, the incident has intensified the debate over Utah's Second Amendment-friendly legislative landscape, including the state's lack of "red-flag" laws. Experts are now questioning the effectiveness of open carry as a deterrent against grievance and politically motivated violence.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a distinguished foreign policy leader who previously chaired the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, has announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2026 after serving 11 terms.

He notably disagreed with former President Trump's recent assessment of Russian drone incursions over Poland, viewing them as a test of NATO's resolve. McCaul's retirement contributes to a period of transition for Texas Republicans and marks the end of a career that included leading a multi-year investigation into the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and receiving sanctions from the Chinese Communist Party for a visit to Taiwan.</p>

Inside sources indicate that Barron chose to remain close to his parents, enrolling in the NYU D.C. program, which uniquely integrates coursework with internships and professional opportunities directly tied to the government. Although he was previously studying at the NYU Stern School of Business, his enrollment in the D.C. campus, which predominantly caters to students pursuing politics, public policy, or journalism, strongly suggests a possible pivot towards political interests. This move further fuels speculation, especially considering his past involvement in assisting his father's presidential campaigns.</p>
