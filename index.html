          <p>A CDC advisory committee has updated its vaccine guidance, notably shifting its stance on COVID-19 shots for most adults to a model of "individual-based decision-making" rather than a universal recommendation. The panel, recently appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also voted to recommend separate MMR and varicella shots over the combined MMRV vaccine for children under four due to a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures. Additionally, the committee decided to postpone a vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for newborns, leaving current recommendations in place for now. These changes reflect a significant shift in the nation's public health messaging on vaccinations.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the individual accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. Over the trial, the prosecution presented evidence of Routh's extensive planning, including surveillance, purchasing a military-grade weapon, and conducting internet searches related to the attack. The final witness, an FBI agent, detailed how Routh lived at a gas station for a month while stalking Trump. Routh, who is representing himself, is expected to call three witnesses for his defense on Monday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media industry. Broadcast networks such as ABC, CBS, and NBC require licenses from the Federal Communications Commission to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While revoking a license is a complex process typically reserved for issues like obscenity or lack of local programming, the current administration is targeting networks based on perceived political bias. This unprecedented pressure comes as major broadcast station owners like Nexstar seek FCC approval for further consolidation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation to increase the application fee for H-1B visas, which are used for highly skilled foreign workers, to $100,000. This new fee would be paid by employers on top of existing costs for the program, which is heavily utilized by US tech companies to recruit talent from countries like India and China. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is intended to incentivize companies to hire and train American workers instead of relying on foreign labor. The move represents a significant escalation in the administration's broader efforts to restrict immigration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brett James, the acclaimed songwriter who co-wrote the Grammy-winning country hit "Jesus, Take the Wheel," was killed in a plane crash in North Carolina at the age of 57. He was one of three people who died when the single-engine aircraft went down in a wooded area near Macon County Airport after taking off from Nashville.

          <p>Remnants of Tropical Storm Mario have caused severe mudslides in San Bernardino Mountain communities like Forest Falls, burying homes, trapping vehicles, and knocking out power. Residents described harrowing scenes, with one man barely escaping as mud and debris "blasted through" his home, destroying his garage and deck. The downpours, which were particularly intense in areas recently scorched by wildfires, turned roads into impassable rivers of mud, boulders, and uprooted trees. Rescue efforts were underway, with community members and officials working to account for residents and their pets amid the widespread damage.</p>

          <p>David Gandy, one of the few male supermodels to become a household name, has voiced concerns about the existential threat artificial intelligence poses to the fashion industry. Ahead of London Fashion Week, he joined over 2,000 other models in calling for government regulation to protect human likenesses from being used by generative AI to create non-existent models for campaigns. Gandy argues that this trend not only harms models but also makes entire creative teams, including photographers, makeup artists, and stylists, redundant. He also expressed worry about the mental health impact of AI-generated, unrealistic imagery on young people.</p>

He states he never engaged in combat and escaped at the first opportunity, surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers. Ukrainian officials note that many foreign recruits in the Russian army come from poorer nations under deceptive pretenses, and Kibet's family in Kenya is urging their government to intervene for his repatriation.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has announced his intention to resign amid pressure from the Trump administration to bring charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that President Trump wanted Siebert removed after a five-month investigation into alleged mortgage fraud by James failed to produce incriminating evidence. The push to prosecute James, a prominent political rival of Trump, and the subsequent ousting of a U.S. Attorney for refusing to do so, has been described by critics as a "brazen attack on the rule of law."

He described playing Shelby for nearly a quarter of his life as a "gift and a privilege," allowing him to grow with a character in a way that is unique to long-form television.

          <h2>Control of TikTok's Algorithm Emerges as Key Point in U.S.-China Divestment Negotiations</h2>

          <p>The fate of TikTok in the United States may depend on a potential licensing agreement for its powerful and closely guarded recommendation algorithm. As the U.S. and China negotiate a deal to avoid a ban, one proposed solution involves a new U.S.-based entity licensing the algorithm technology from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or manipulate content. However, experts caution that a licensing deal, rather than an outright sale, might not fully sever ties and could still allow ByteDance to access metrics or influence content ranking.</p>

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a "seismic" upset by defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns in the World Cup semi-final, ending their 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament. The Canadian side, which had to crowdfund to support its journey to the competition, dominated the match with a stunning first-half performance, ultimately securing a 24-7 victory. The result was described as a "fairytale" and marks a monumental moment for Canadian rugby. Canada will now advance to the World Cup final at Twickenham, their first appearance since 2014, where they will face either France or England.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Recent Vaccine Policy Shifts Could Create a Two-Tier System in the U.S.</h2>

          <p>Recent chaotic votes by the CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) on childhood vaccines are pointing toward the potential creation of a two-tiered system for vaccine access in America. This article argues that by removing certain combination vaccines from the federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which serves about half of U.S. children, the panel is creating disparities. While families with private insurance may still have access to these shots, poorer families reliant on VFC will not, creating inconveniences and potential health-care gaps. This shift mirrors the confusion around recent COVID-19 vaccine policy and risks returning to an era of vaccine inequity.</p>

          <p>The United States military has deployed its Typhon mid-range missile system to a marine base in Iwakuni, Japan, for the first time in the Asia-Pacific region. The deployment is part of the annual "Resolute Dragon" joint training exercise involving approximately 20,000 U.S. and Japanese troops. This marks the first time such a weapon, capable of firing missiles with a range between 500km and 5,500km, has been stationed in the region since the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty expired. While the U.S. military stated the system will be removed after the exercise, its presence is likely to prompt China to enhance its own counterstrike capabilities.</p>

          <p>A large, long-standing homeless encampment on a private lot in Koreatown, which had grown to include a makeshift pickleball court and a garden, was cleared by city workers. The encampment, home to about 10 people, had been the subject of numerous complaints from nearby residents regarding noise, safety, and sanitation. City officials stated that eight individuals from the site were moved into interim housing as part of the cleanup operation coordinated with the property owner. A former resident expressed a sense of loss, stating that while they may have been noisy, they never harassed neighbors and had built a community there.</p>

During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, but UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that this responsibility falls to the UK Border Force. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense issues around the world. The comments came as nearly 1,000 migrants were believed to have crossed the Channel on Friday, and the UK government deported two individuals back to France under a new "one in, one out" agreement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $2.6 billion expansion of the city's convention center, moving forward despite stark warnings from its own policy advisors about the significant financial risks. The project is expected to draw an average of $89 million annually from the city's general fund for 30 years, potentially impacting essential services like police and fire departments. Proponents, including Mayor Karen Bass, argue the expansion is a necessary investment that will create jobs and boost tourism, especially ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. However, critics call the project unaffordable and fear it will worsen the city's budget situation. (not investment advice)</p>

The demonstration reflects growing anger within the creative community over what they see as a dangerous attack on free speech. Protestors argued that threatening a network's broadcast license over commentary on a show sets a precedent that could chill free expression across all of network television.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the lengthy filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the 85-page complaint for being filled with political rhetoric and self-praise rather than focused legal arguments. While tossing the suit, the judge is allowing Trump's legal team to refile a shorter, more conventional complaint within 28 days. When questioned about the dismissal, Trump deflected, stating "I'm winning the cases," before criticizing the reporting of ABC News, demonstrating his continued adversarial stance toward the media.</p>

This development comes as the Trump administration has repeatedly delayed a federally mandated ban that would require TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns.</p>

The party argues this "police desk promise" would make law enforcement more accessible, making it easier for the public to report crimes and share information, thereby boosting confidence in policing. To fund the initiative, the Liberal Democrats suggest scrapping the elected Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) positions, which they claim would free up the necessary cash. The announcement comes at the start of the party's annual conference as it seeks to define its platform.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has confirmed that NBA superstar Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his bitcoin account on the cryptocurrency exchange after being locked out for years. The issue gained public attention after Durant and his agent discussed the predicament at a recent conference, highlighting the difficulties they faced with the platform's account recovery process. Durant, an early investor in both Coinbase and bitcoin, purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was a small fraction of today's price. The high-profile case has amplified a wider discussion among users about the quality and effectiveness of Coinbase's customer support services.</p>

With lawmakers now leaving Washington for a recess, there is no clear path forward.
