          <p>Bitcoin's price dipped below $77,000 amidst a broader market downturn triggered by President Trump's newly implemented global tariffs, which have raised concerns about a potential global trade war and recession. The tariffs, impacting numerous countries, have caused significant volatility in financial markets, leading investors to shed risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Despite the downturn, some analysts suggest Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against tariff risks due to increased U.S. isolationism, potentially benefiting from the uncertainties surrounding fiat currencies. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has publicly stated that President Trump's newly announced tariffs are likely to increase prices on both imported and domestic goods, thus hindering the already weakening U.S. economy. Dimon emphasized the potential for inflationary outcomes due to rising input costs and increased demand for domestic products as a result of the tariffs. He cautioned that while a recession is not certain, the tariffs will undoubtedly slow down economic growth, adding further strain to the market. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields have fallen as President Trump's tariffs spark concerns about an economic slowdown, leading traders to increase expectations for multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Market participants now anticipate at least five rate cuts in 2025, with a significant probability of a cut at the May meeting. The tariffs, which have ignited fears of a global trade war, are prompting investors to seek safer assets, driving down Treasury yields as they price in a more dovish monetary policy response. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <h2>Repressed Memories: Fact or Fiction? A New Memoir Sparks Debate.</h2>

          <p>Amy Griffin's memoir, "The Tell," explores the recovery of repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse through psychedelic therapy, sparking debate about the validity of repressed memories. While the book has garnered praise and attention, it clashes with scientific consensus that memories of trauma are typically well-remembered, not repressed. The science suggests that therapy may trigger the formation of false memories and it is important for therapists to inform clients that memory distortions are possible. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many believe that these memories are real and helpful in the therapeutic process.</p>

          <p>Israel launched air strikes on Gaza in retaliation for a barrage of rockets fired by Hamas, marking one of the heaviest in months. The Israeli military stated that some rockets landed in Israel, causing injuries, while others were intercepted. In response, Prime Minister Netanyahu ordered a "strong response" while en route to Washington for talks with President Trump. The Hamas-run health ministry reported numerous Palestinian deaths, including a journalist, due to Israeli actions.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant surge in measles cases, with infections confirmed in 21 states, surpassing numbers seen in recent years. A large outbreak in West Texas has contributed to the rise, leading to multiple deaths and prompting health officials to emphasize the importance of vaccination. Lower vaccination rates are cited as a key factor in the increase, raising concerns that the U.S. may lose its status as having eliminated the disease.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry amid the impact of tariffs imposed by the US. The government has sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs. While a ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect for 2030, manufacturers will have greater flexibility on annual targets and face reduced fines. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline. The car industry will also be given £2.3bn in tax breaks.</p>

          <p>Three students and two recent graduates from Harvard University have had their student visas revoked, with no specific reason provided by the Trump administration. This action is part of a broader trend of deporting international students, with approximately 300 visas revoked nationwide, allegedly due to participation in campus protests. The revocations have raised concerns about freedom of speech and academic freedom, particularly in light of the detention of a Tufts University graduate student for her pro-Palestinian views.</p>
