          <p>AstraZeneca is expanding its access to U.S. investors by offering American Depositary Receipts, a move welcomed by investors with a slight share price increase. This decision, while not a full listing change, follows a trend of major companies moving primary listings away from London, raising concerns about the city's financial market appeal. The company maintains its UK-listed, headquartered, and tax-resident status, aiming to tap into New York's larger capital pools. However, the article suggests this could ease a full switch if UK frustrations persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck a central Philippine province, resulting in at least 69 fatalities and trapping numerous residents in collapsed structures. The hard-hit city of Bogo and surrounding towns in Cebu province are conducting frantic search and rescue operations, hampered by intermittent rain and damaged infrastructure. This powerful quake, following a recent tropical storm, has left thousands traumatized, with many opting to stay in open areas overnight despite the weather.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel reportedly gifted illegal replica firearms to New Zealand officials during a visit earlier this year, according to local police authorities. The gifts, described as "coin display stands featuring an inoperable plastic 3D-printed replica pistol," were later deemed potentially operable with modifications. New Zealand, with strict firearms laws, destroyed all the items. The U.S. embassy acknowledged the gifts were well-intentioned design elements, accepting New Zealand's decision, highlighting a diplomatic faux pas due to differing national regulations on firearms.</p>

          <p>England has implemented a ban on multi-buy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free" deals, for unhealthy food and drink in larger retailers and online. This measure, previously delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, aims to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health experts view this as a necessary first step, encouraging retailers to promote healthier options and noting evidence that similar restrictions can reduce sales of unhealthy products. The article emphasizes the long-term goal of improving public health and addressing health inequalities.</p>

          <p>China's military perceives the expanded joint cyber and AI-integrated exercises between the U.S., Japan, and South Korea as a significant risk to regional security. A Chinese military commentary argues these drills transcend traditional cooperation, evolving into strategic tools that destabilize the area. The article suggests that "exaggerated regional threats" concerning China and North Korea are being used to justify the increasing frequency, geographic scope, and operational domains of these military exercises. This indicates growing geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

The article highlights Jacob Palmer, 23, who owns an electrical company, as an example of this trend. Many Gen Zers prioritize jobs hard to automate, viewing professions like electricians and plumbers as secure. Experts note a shift in perception, with trades now seen as viable career paths, contrasting with rising unemployment for recent college graduates in fields susceptible to AI displacement.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown could disrupt air travel, particularly if prolonged, despite most FAA and TSA employees being deemed essential. Airport screeners and air traffic controllers are required to work without pay, but past shutdowns have shown increased sick calls and staff shortages if pay delays persist. The article warns of potential longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations. The U.S. Travel Association estimates a $1 billion weekly economic cost. Train travel and passport services are expected to remain largely unaffected in the near term.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the 15th funding lapse since 1980, following a pattern of political stalemates over appropriations. The article details the history of shutdowns, from President Reagan's eight brief closures to the 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019, which caused $3 billion in permanent economic losses. Historically, agencies continued operating before 1980, but legal opinions then mandated closures without funding. These events highlight recurring congressional disagreements, often over policy riders or budget priorities, leading to significant disruption for federal workers and the economy.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive their salaries, unlike most federal employees who face delayed pay or furloughs. This is due to constitutional provisions and permanent appropriations that ensure their compensation. Most members earn $174,000 annually. Conversely, federal employees in critical positions work without pay, and others are furloughed, though a 2019 law guarantees them back pay once funding is restored. The article highlights the disparity in pay certainty between lawmakers and the federal workforce during a shutdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government shut down due to a failure by lawmakers to agree on extending funding, primarily stemming from a dispute over healthcare tax credits. Democrats insisted on including a permanent extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in any funding measure, which Republicans opposed, arguing healthcare should be negotiated separately. With neither side budging and the House recessing, a stalemate ensued, leading to the lapse in spending authority. The article highlights the political blame game and the economic costs of such shutdowns.</p>

Both parties immediately engaged in a blame game, with the White House website accusing Democrats and Democratic leaders blaming President Trump for the "erratic and unhinged" behavior that led to the impasse.
