          <p>A United Nations agency, Unesco, hosted a global forum in Bangkok to advocate for its ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence, urging international collaboration among governments and civil society.

          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law set to restrict public benefits for undocumented immigrants, including access to life-saving HIV/AIDS medication. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four residents with HIV, argues the law is vague and contradicts federal statutes, creating a public health risk. It highlights that dozens of patients could lose access to treatment that prevents them from transmitting the virus. This law appears to be the first of its kind limiting public health benefits since a similar federal push under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The British government has confirmed significant changes to its proposed welfare bill, representing a major climbdown after facing substantial pressure from over 100 rebel Labour MPs. The concessions ensure that current recipients of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not see their benefits cut; planned reductions will only apply to future claimants. This move, which avoids a potential government defeat in the House of Commons, has been framed by No 10 as preserving the social security system while reflecting Labour values. The decision marks the third major government U-turn in a month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the World Economic Forum event in Tianjin, prominent economists argued that for China to achieve long-term prosperity, it must pivot from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy through structural reforms. Professor Jin Keyu noted that China's current model, which heavily subsidizes production, creates trade imbalances and global friction. She suggested that boosting internal consumption, particularly in the services sector and smaller cities, is crucial for harmonizing its international trade relationships. The experts recommended that local governments should be evaluated on consumption metrics to incentivize this necessary economic shift. (not investment advice)</p>

Travel platforms report a massive increase in flight bookings, with some seeing a nearly twelve-fold surge in demand for Chongqing compared to other major Chinese cities. The city's appeal lies in its "cyberpunk" aesthetic and multi-dimensional landscape, which resonates with young travelers who use platforms like TikTok for holiday planning. Improved amenities, convenient transport, and effective crowd control have also contributed to its growing reputation as a top travel destination.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a significant 9.1% year-over-year decline in May, marking the most substantial drop since October of the previous year. This downturn is attributed by the statistics bureau to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods, signaling that government stimulus efforts may not be effectively boosting corporate financial health. Despite a mixed bag of other economic data, such as strong retail sales, this profit plunge highlights ongoing challenges in the nation's manufacturing and mining sectors. Economists suggest this data alone is unlikely to prompt immediate, large-scale government stimulus action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is investigating a crane collapse that occurred at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas. The incident, captured on a livestream, has prompted federal scrutiny into the company's workplace safety practices. It is not yet clear if any workers were injured in the collapse, and SpaceX has not commented on the matter. This investigation comes amid a history of workplace injuries at the company exceeding industry averages and follows a series of setbacks for its Starship rocket program, which is central to CEO Elon Musk's long-term space exploration goals.</p>

          <p>A region in northern West Virginia, still recovering from deadly flash floods less than two weeks ago, was once again inundated by torrential rains, causing creeks to overflow. The Wheeling area received a flash flood warning as up to two inches of rain fell rapidly, with residents sharing videos of streets turning into rivers. This event follows a tragic flood on June 14 that killed nine people and caused extensive damage. The West Virginia Emergency Management Division warned residents in low-lying areas to be prepared to evacuate as the community braces for another potential disaster.</p>

The move came after Bernal's lawyer withdrew from a scheduled voluntary interview, according to Chairman James Comer. This is the second subpoena issued in the rapidly expanding probe, which seeks to determine if there was an effort to conceal the former president's fitness to serve. The investigation, supported by President Trump, has gained momentum as Trump waived executive privilege for several former Biden administration officials.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai is facing harsh criticism from opposition lawmakers following a speech in which he compared the nation's democratic progress to forging steel by removing all "impurities." Critics condemned the remarks as a veiled threat and an attempt to justify a political purge of dissent. They linked the rhetoric to the ruling party's efforts to recall dozens of opposition Kuomintang legislators. An opposition party chairman characterized the language as echoing the extreme ideological purity of regimes like North Korea and called on citizens to reject what he termed Lai's "dictatorship."</p>

          <h2>Trump Promotes Tax and Spending Bill, Omitting Previously Stated July 4 Deadline</h2>

          <p>In a final pitch for his major tax-and-spending legislation, President Donald Trump made no mention of his previous demand for Congress to pass the "big beautiful bill" by July 4. Speaking at the White House, he argued the bill would benefit working families and bolster immigration enforcement, featuring new tax cuts and extending lower rates from his first term. However, the bill faces strong opposition from Democrats, who criticize its significant cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, and its passage through the Senate remains uncertain due to potential logjams.

          <h2>Senators Remain Sharply Divided Following Intelligence Briefing on Iran Strikes</h2>

          <p>A behind-closed-doors intelligence briefing on the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities has left Republican and Democratic senators with starkly different conclusions. The briefing, which the White House had delayed, was intended to clarify the effectiveness of the strikes, but partisan divisions remain deep. Trump ally Lindsey Graham described the sites' operational capability as "obliterated," while Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated the briefing offered "no coherent strategy" and no proof of Trump's claims. The session proceeded without the Director of National Intelligence, fueling further controversy over the administration's transparency with Congress.</p>

          <h2>Bright Fireball Streaks Across Southeastern U.S. Sky, Explodes Over Georgia</h2>

          <p>A large, bright meteorite, described as a fireball, was witnessed streaking across the daytime sky in the southeastern United States before exploding over Georgia. NASA reported that the object, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weigh over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. The subsequent explosion, which occurred 27 miles above the ground, released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT, creating a sonic boom heard by many residents. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event from observers in Georgia and South Carolina.</p>

          <h2>Massachusetts 'Cool Block' Project Offers a Model for Mitigating Extreme Urban Heat</h2>

          <p>A pilot project in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is demonstrating effective strategies for combating the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense urban areas become significantly hotter than surrounding greener spaces. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots, has implemented solutions like planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This urban laboratory provides a tangible template for other cities as they grapple with rising temperatures due to climate change. Research shows such interventions can reduce peak urban temperatures by several degrees, potentially saving lives during heat waves.</p>
