          <p>Protests across five UK cities against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization have resulted in nearly 100 arrests. Demonstrators held placards expressing support for the group, leading to arrests under the Terrorism Act in London, Bristol, and other locations. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense, followed an incident where activists caused millions in damage to aircraft at an RAF base. The protests occurred ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban filed by the group's co-founder.</p>

DeChambeau called the pace in the initial rounds "out of control" and advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player.

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has announced the official launch of a massive dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in the Tibet autonomous region. The hydroelectric facility is expected to be the world's largest and is part of China's broader strategy to harness the hydropower potential of the Tibetan Plateau. The project has raised significant concerns in neighboring India, as the Yarlung Tsangpo is the upstream source of the Brahmaputra River, a vital water source for India's northeastern states and Bangladesh. The plan was first announced in 2020 and approved last year.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's tariff policies shows mixed results, with some economists crediting them for increased tax revenue and encouraging some companies to pledge U.S. investment. However, critics caution that these investment promises have long timelines and that the tariffs have started to increase consumer prices on some imported goods, risking inflation. The effective tariff rate on U.S. consumers is at its highest since 1910, and recent threats of new tariffs on trade partners like Japan and South Korea add further uncertainty to the economic outlook.

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. is recalling more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand sweet apple chicken sausage due to potential contamination with pieces of white plastic. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the recall after the company received three consumer complaints about finding plastic in the ready-to-eat products. The affected sausages were produced on June 28, 2025, and distributed nationwide. So far, no injuries have been reported, and consumers are advised to either discard the product or return it for a refund.</p>

          <p>Legal and policy experts are weighing the significant ramifications should President Trump attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Such a move would be unprecedented and would almost certainly trigger a messy and uncertain legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court. Economists warn that challenging the Fed's independence could destabilize financial markets, potentially leading to higher inflation and interest rates if the central bank's credibility is undermined. The article explores whether Trump's threats are a genuine plan or a political strategy to create a scapegoat for any future economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bestselling author and self-made millionaire Scott Galloway asserts that "follow your passion" is poor career advice, often given by those who are already wealthy. Galloway, an NYU marketing professor, suggests that a more effective path to success is to find something you are good at and that has the potential to be lucrative. He advises that career success comes from combining talent with opportunity and developing resilience to endure rejection, rather than blindly pursuing a passion. This sentiment is echoed by other successful leaders who recommend a more pragmatic approach to career choices.</p>

          <p>The article examines a recent cultural resurgence in tanning, moving beyond simple aesthetics to become a symbol of a broader ideology. It connects the trend to the "Make America Healthy Again" movement and alternative-health circles that are skeptical of mainstream public health advice, including warnings about sun exposure and sunscreen. These groups often promote the sun's benefits for vitamin D and mood while downplaying or denying the well-established risks of skin cancer. This new "sun worship" is presented as a form of defiance against the scientific establishment, appealing to those who feel failed by traditional institutions.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) and reducing its workforce by nearly 23%, or over 3,700 employees. The ORD, which provides the scientific foundation for the agency's regulations, will be replaced by a new office, a move the administration claims will save money and focus on applied science. Critics, including congressional Democrats and union leaders, have called the move a "travesty" that will devastate public health and environmental protection by firing thousands of hardworking scientists and undermining the agency's core mission.</p>

          <p>The UK is under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across all four nations, bringing the threat of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the widespread flooding that was feared. However, the Met Office cautions that the recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, making localized flooding more likely. The unsettled weather is expected to continue into the beginning of the week, with new alerts issued for Monday.</p>

Rashford has indicated a desire for a new challenge after being made to train separately from the United first-team squad. The move would be financially beneficial for Manchester United, as it would free up Rashford's significant wages, allowing the club to pursue other transfer targets.

While the targeted sites are not believed to have active reactors, experts express concern about the potential release of toxic and radioactive uranium hexafluoride gas. The IAEA reported no increase in regional radiation, but experts note that any on-site contamination could pose severe chemical and radiological hazards to workers.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man on Long Island has died from severe injuries sustained after being pulled into an MRI machine. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress, despite being told not to. The powerful magnetic field reportedly pulled the chain around his neck, drawing him into the machine. The incident underscores the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI scans, which can be extremely dangerous when metallic objects are brought into their magnetic field.</p>
