          <p>Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, imposing a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on transshipped items. In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants the United States tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets, a move Trump highlighted as a major win for American exports. The deal comes ahead of an expiring pause on broader "reciprocal tariffs," and its implementation details remain unclear. Critics express concern over potential price increases for U.S. consumers on goods manufactured in Vietnam, such as apparel.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has stated that Israel agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. However, Israel has not officially confirmed this agreement, and a Hamas official indicated the group is ready for a deal only if it guarantees a permanent end to the war. A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations told the BBC that the current proposal offers no significant changes from a previously rejected offer. The announcement creates pressure on both sides, but fundamental disagreements over a permanent truce and military withdrawal remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives is debating President Trump's major tax and immigration bill, but its passage is uncertain due to deep divisions within the Republican party and attendance problems. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a razor-thin majority, with fiscal hawks opposing the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the deficit and other members concerned about cuts to programs like Medicaid. The legislation, which passed the Senate with a tie-breaking vote, includes significant tax cuts and border security funding but also slashes entitlement programs, making its journey through the House highly contentious.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is experiencing a significant internal rift, highlighted by socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary. This win signals a generational shift away from the party's establishment, which is concurrently developing "Project 2029," a long-term policy agenda for a future Democratic president. The divide is further emphasized by the hesitancy of moderate Democrats to endorse Mamdani, citing his positions on Israel and alleged antisemitism. This tension reflects a broader struggle over the party's future direction following its 2024 election losses.</p>

          <p>The High Court has mandated a "robust and independent" new inquiry into how the UK's security service, MI5, provided false evidence to multiple courts. This decision comes after judges rejected two previous internal and external reviews as "seriously deficient." The case originated from a BBC investigation that revealed MI5 had lied about its relationship with a neo-Nazi state agent who abused women. The judges commended the BBC for exposing the issue and stated they could not rely on the conclusions of the prior inquiries, which had absolved MI5 of deliberate wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its challenge to presidential removal powers by asking the Supreme Court to allow the firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The request follows a lower court's ruling that blocked the terminations of the Biden-appointed commissioners, who serve fixed terms to ensure the agency's independence. The administration argues that the president should have unrestricted authority to remove executive officers. This case is the latest in a series of legal battles testing the limits of presidential power over independent federal agencies.</p>

The racketeering charge, which required proving a coordinated criminal enterprise, was challenging for prosecutors as defense lawyers argued there was no evidence Combs' employees were knowingly complicit.

          <p>Iran's president has signed legislation to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), halting inspector access until the security of its nuclear facilities is guaranteed. This move, which follows recent US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, could severely limit the UN agency's ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program. While Iran has framed the action as a temporary suspension rather than a complete withdrawal from the Nonproliferation Treaty, the decision has drawn condemnation from Israel and heightens regional tensions.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later in 2025, an article suggests that now is an opportune time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). By locking in a CD, savers can protect their money from future rate drops and secure a fixed return, with current rates offering significant interest on deposits. For example, a $20,000 deposit in a six-month CD could earn over $400 in interest. This strategy provides predictable growth and allows savers time to consider their next financial moves in an uncertain economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The passage of Donald Trump's major budget bill through the House is threatened by deep divisions within the Republican party, despite their control of the chamber. A key sticking point is the bill's projected impact on the national deficit, which has outraged fiscally conservative "deficit hawks" in the House Freedom Caucus. Another major concern for some Republicans is the Senate version's deeper cuts to Medicaid, which they fear will harm their constituents and hurt them in future elections. These internal battles highlight the difficulty of uniting the party's different factions behind the president's signature legislation.</p>

An internal acknowledgement of the need for better decision-making and communication exists, but the party has struggled to present a competent image.

However, critics point to the immense challenges, including the grocery industry's slim profit margins and complex supply chains.

The decline was driven by losses in service-providing sectors, particularly professional/business services and health/education, while goods-producing roles saw a modest expansion.

          <p>The Trump administration is withholding more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school programs, summer camps, and other educational services, creating uncertainty for schools and low-income families nationwide. The funding was frozen pending a review to ensure it aligns with the president's priorities, but no timeline for its release has been given. Program providers like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America warn that the freeze could force them to shut down, jeopardizing care for hundreds of thousands of children and potentially leading to job losses for program staff.</p>
