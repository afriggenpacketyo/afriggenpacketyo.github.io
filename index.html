          <p>After Vice President JD Vance dismissed the India-Pakistan conflict as not America’s problem, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear escalation.

Vance and Marco Rubio engaged directly with leaders in both countries, urging de-escalation, and President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement. This article highlights the behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to prevent a full-scale war, with Pakistan acknowledging American intervention while India remained silent on the matter.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security says that the lawmakers could also face arrest and claims to have footage of them assaulting ICE officers.
