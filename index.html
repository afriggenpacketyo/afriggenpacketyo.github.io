          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax bill could lead to higher taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries deemed to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. The measure, known as Section 899, could deter international companies from expanding into the U.S. due to concerns about potential tax burdens. An analysis by the Global Business Alliance estimates that the provision could cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually in lost GDP over 10 years. Republican Rep. Jason Smith defends the provision as a tool to protect U.S. interests, while critics argue it could harm businesses, consumers, and workers. (not investment advice)</p>
