          <p>Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips, a move that sent Intel shares soaring. Nvidia's investment is priced at $23.28 a share, and Intel will build x86 central processing units for Nvidia's AI infrastructure platforms. This partnership also includes Intel building x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX graphics processing units for PCs, signaling a major collaboration between the two tech giants. The White House hailed the partnership as a significant milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, with Intel shares experiencing their best day since October 1987. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and France have initiated a 'one in, one out' migrant exchange program, with the first migrant deported to France. The agreement aims to deter small boat crossings by exchanging migrants, where for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong asylum case in the UK will be accepted. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood emphasized the program sends a message against illegal entry into the UK, while the government is appealing a High Court decision blocking another deportation due to modern slavery concerns. This initiative comes as the UK seeks to manage migration through safe, legal, and managed routes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated the White House is content with the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. While new Fed Governor Stephen Miran advocated for a larger cut, Hassett acknowledged the move as a prudent first step towards lower rates. President Trump has previously criticized the Fed for not cutting rates aggressively enough, despite strong economic growth. Hassett assessed the decision as a balanced approach, considering economic models and inflation levels, reflecting a compromise within the committee. (not investment advice)</p>

The company aims to increase annual sales to 5.55 million units by 2030, a roughly 34% increase from last year. CEO José Muñoz highlighted the U.S. as the "engine of growth" and announced a $26 billion investment from 2025 to 2028 to expand U.S. operations.

          <p>FCC Chairman Brendan Carr accused Jimmy Kimmel of misleading the public regarding the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Carr suggested the FCC might take action against ABC and Disney, Kimmel's employer, before ABC pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely. Kimmel's comments linked Kirk's alleged killer to President Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement, while court documents indicated the killer leaned left and supported gay and trans rights. House Democrats have called for Carr's resignation, alleging abuse of power and bullying ABC.</p>

          <p>During a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Trump commented on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Trump stated he told Kirk he had a good chance of becoming president someday, praising Kirk's ability to connect with youth. The Trump administration vowed to crack down on left-leaning groups it claims contribute to political violence in the wake of Kirk's death. Trump also addressed the TikTok deal, saying the U.S. would get a "tremendous fee" and that it would be owned by "all American investors."</p>

          <p>A new UN report states that North Korea has the harshest repression in the world, with the death penalty reportedly used for sharing foreign media. The report, based on interviews with defectors, details how ordinary North Koreans' lives have become significantly more difficult in the last decade. The government exercises total control over the population, severely restricting fundamental rights and freedoms, and criminalizes access to unauthorized foreign information. Citizens are required to participate in frequent "self-criticism sessions" and undergo constant indoctrination.</p>

Starting in 2027, catch-up contributions must generally be after-tax (Roth) for workers who made more than $145,000 from their current employer during the previous year. Investors can choose between pretax and Roth retirement catch-up contributions until then, if their workplace plans offer both choices. Advisors suggest running multi-year tax projections to decide whether to accelerate pretax contributions or embrace Roth sooner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India is witnessing a growing debate over food choices, with measures targeting meat consumption increasing since 2014, particularly in northern India. Vegetarianism is often promoted by Hindu nationalist groups as a marker of "traditional" Hindu values, ignoring diverse food practices. Meat-eating is often associated with religious minorities and marginalized groups, reinforcing social boundaries. A 2021 survey indicated that 80% of Indians aged 15-49 consume some form of meat, contrary to the widespread perception of India as a predominantly vegetarian country.</p>

          <p>Attorneys general and advocacy groups are opposing the Trump administration's proposed rule that could narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The PSLF program allows non-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments. An executive order signed by President Trump in March stated that borrowers employed by organizations involved in certain activities will not be eligible for PSLF. Critics argue that the rule is unconstitutional and harmful to millions of borrowers.</p>
