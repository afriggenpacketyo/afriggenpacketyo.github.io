          <p>The Department of Education launched a Title IX investigation into Portland Public Schools and the Oregon School Activities Association for allegedly allowing a transgender student to compete in girls' track.  The investigation stems from a complaint alleging violations of Title IX, focusing on the student's participation and locker room access.  The investigation follows President Trump's executive order recognizing only two sexes.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts offer accessibility and liquidity with variable APYs, while no-penalty CDs provide fixed rates but with potential waiting periods for withdrawals.  Both options are beneficial depending on individual needs and risk tolerance; high-yield accounts are suitable for emergency funds or short-term goals, while no-penalty CDs are better for long-term savings. <i></i><br>(not investment advice)<i></i></p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling requiring the reinstatement of millions in canceled education grants. The grants were canceled due to their funding of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which the administration deemed discriminatory. The administration argues the lower court overstepped its authority in managing executive branch funding decisions.</p>

          <p>A House subcommittee hearing, chaired by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, focused on alleged bias in NPR and PBS programming and explored the possibility of defunding public media.

          <p>The Trump administration intends to eliminate funding for Gavi, a global health organization providing vaccines to developing countries. This decision, part of broader foreign aid cuts, has raised concerns about its impact on global health security and the lives of millions of children.

          <p>Russia conditioned its participation in a Ukraine maritime ceasefire on the lifting of Western sanctions targeting Russian banks, including Rosselkhozbank.  While the U.S. announced a ceasefire agreement, Russia's demands and conflicting statements from Kyiv highlight the complexities of reaching a lasting peace. The Black Sea's strategic importance for grain exports is a key factor in the negotiations.</p>
