          <h2>Guangdong Province Defies China's Declining Birth Rates Due to Cultural Traditions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China grapples with declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, maintains a higher birth rate due to strong cultural traditions honoring lineage and ancestral halls. The idea that more children bring more blessings, especially sons to carry on the family name, remains prevalent in this region. Guangdong recorded 1.13 million births in 2024, making it China's top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year, with a birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people, among the highest in the country. This trend highlights the difficulty of replicating Guangdong's success nationwide due to deeply rooted cultural differences.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This initiative follows California's lead in banning these dyes due to concerns about developmental and behavioral harms in children.

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering her two children, has been found guilty of conspiring with her brother to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Prosecutors argued that the shooting was a ploy to obtain his $1 million life insurance policy and to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell. The jury was swayed by text messages discussing the life insurance policy and references to their "twisted" religious beliefs. She now faces another trial in Maricopa County for allegedly scheming to kill her niece's ex-husband.</p>
