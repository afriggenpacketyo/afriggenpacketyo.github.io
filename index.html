          <p>Twenty-five countries, including major U.S. allies like the U.K., Canada, and Japan, have jointly called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza. Their statement criticizes Israel for what it terms the "inhumane killing of civilians" and the "drip feeding of aid," which has created a dangerous and undignified situation for Gazans. The coalition also condemned Hamas for its continued detention of hostages, urging their immediate release and emphasizing that a negotiated ceasefire is the best path forward. Israel rejected the statement, calling it disconnected from reality and claiming it sends the wrong message to Hamas amid ongoing truce negotiations.</p>

          <p>Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, widely known for his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," has died at the age of 54. Officials in Costa Rica confirmed his death was due to an accidental drowning at a beach on the country's Caribbean coast. Warner's career spanned decades, including roles in "Malcolm & Eddie" and "The Resident," as well as directing and work as a Grammy-winning musician and poet. Friends and colleagues remembered him as a kind, humble individual who was conscious of his cultural impact and concerned with how Black Americans were represented in art and media.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Deport Lawful Permanent Residents Allegedly Linked to Haitian Gangs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States government has initiated procedures to deport lawful permanent residents who are accused of supporting or collaborating with violent gangs in Haiti. This policy specifically targets individuals linked to Viv Ansanm, a gang alliance that the Trump administration designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The announcement follows the arrest of Pierre Reginald Boulos, a prominent Haitian businessman and former presidential candidate, in Miami, although his specific charges have not been clarified. This move comes as Haiti continues to struggle with severe gang violence and political instability following the 2021 assassination of its president.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declassified and released approximately 200,000 pages of FBI records detailing the surveillance of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The release proceeded despite opposition from King's family, who warned against weaponizing the information, which originates from J. Edgar Hoover's invasive COINTELPRO campaign designed to discredit their father. In a statement, King's children reiterated their belief that he was killed in a conspiracy involving government agencies and urged the public to view the files within their historical context. Critics, including Rev. Al Sharpton, framed the release as a political maneuver to distract from other controversies facing the administration.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Congress will not vote on a resolution concerning the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files before its August recess. Johnson stated that the Trump administration should be given the space to conduct its own process, and congressional action will be considered later if necessary. This decision comes after the Justice Department formally requested a judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the case. The delay stalls a non-binding Republican resolution and a separate bipartisan measure led by Rep. Thomas Massie, who is pushing for a vote to compel the immediate release of the documents.</p>

          <p>Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for his role in the 2020 raid that led to the death of Breonna Taylor.

Hankison is the only officer to face conviction and prison time directly related to the fatal raid, which sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the Trump administration is using the judicial system to implement its policies, a strategy that is reshaping the balance of presidential power. Recent Supreme Court rulings have expanded presidential immunity and limited lower courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions, emboldening the administration's use of executive orders. This has led to direct confrontations with federal judges, who have faced unprecedented criticism and threats, raising concerns among legal experts about the long-term impact on judicial independence. The administration argues it is countering judicial overreach, while critics contend it is undermining the constitutional system of checks and balances.</p>

The group claims these practices compromise meritocracy in medicine.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's second term is characterized by a culture of pettiness and vengeance rather than coherent policy. The author cites several examples, including purges at the FBI, pressure on the Federal Reserve, and a fluctuating policy on Ukraine driven by personal slights from Vladimir Putin rather than strategic goals. The piece suggests that this approach, which focuses on personal grievances and culture-war battles, has been internalized by his administration, leading to actions like barring a former intelligence chief from a CIA event for a dog named after his late wife. The author concludes that this governance style prioritizes small, vindictive acts over substantive national problem-solving.</p>

According to official correspondence, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and Camp Atterbury will be used to hold up to 1,000 people each, supporting ICE removal operations out of Newark and Chicago, respectively. The plan also includes doubling detention capacity at Guantanamo Bay to 400. This expansion of detention facilities is part of the Trump administration's broader push to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status, utilizing military resources under the declared national emergency at the southern border.</p>

          <p>A persistent heat dome is trapping over 90 million Americans in a wave of extreme temperatures, with heat alerts issued from Nebraska to Florida. The National Weather Service warns that much of the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast will experience dangerous conditions, with heat index values potentially reaching 110 to 115 degrees. In the Corn Belt, high humidity is exacerbated by "corn sweat," where transpiring crops release moisture into the air. While not record-breaking, these temperatures are significantly above average, and climate analysis suggests that human-caused climate change has made such heat events at least three times more likely for nearly half the U.S. population.</p>

          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting systems, arguing it would save both lives and money. In a letter to the president, the Democratic senator outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading the Doppler radar network and weather satellites, following deadly floods in Texas. The plea comes as the Trump administration has proposed significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service. Cantwell emphasized that proactive investment in better forecasting technology could mitigate the multi-billion dollar costs associated with increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>

          <p>This article examines the nomination of Emil Bove to the federal bench, positioning him as a symbol of a potential new direction for President Trump's judicial appointments. During his first term, Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. Bove's nomination, however, suggests a shift towards prioritizing figures known for their alignment with the MAGA movement's political and legal strategies. The piece explores how this evolution in judicial selection could further reshape the federal courts, moving beyond traditional conservative legal theory to a judiciary more directly engaged with the administration's political agenda.</p>

The new assignment to Judge Darrin Gayles raises the possibility that Trump will again face a choice between sitting for a sworn deposition, where he could be questioned about his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, or dropping another high-profile lawsuit. The current suit stems from a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein.</p>

The Justice Department has also alleged that several current districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.

Harvard's lawyers argued the move harms vital public research into medicine and other fields and is an attempt to control the university's internal affairs.
