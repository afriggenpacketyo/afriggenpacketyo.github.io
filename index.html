          <h2>Los Angeles Experiences Calm After Immigration Protest Arrests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 02:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles has returned to a state of uneasy calm after a night of curfew following protests sparked by US President Donald Trump's immigration raids. Nearly 400 people have been arrested, including undocumented migrants, for assault and obstruction, with federal prosecutors charging two men for throwing Molotov cocktails. The LA Mayor blamed Trump's immigration policies for provoking fear and panic among residents, suggesting the city is part of a national experiment to usurp local government power. National Guard troops are authorized to detain people until police can arrest them, leading to accusations of an assault on democracy by California's governor. The situation is described as not city-wide but rather contained to a small area of downtown, though tensions remain high. Optimism is somewhat tempered by the ongoing political conflict.</p>

          <p>Juror issues have emerged in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial for sexual assault allegations, raising concerns about potential bias and a possible mistrial. The prosecution has requested the removal of a Black juror, Juror No. 6, due to a "lack of candor," suggesting the juror may have lied to get on the case. Legal experts suggest that complications with the jury could lead to severe problems, including a mistrial, if the juror is biased. Jane, Diddy's ex-girlfriend, continued her testimony, detailing alleged drug use and hotel nights during their relationship. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with witnesses testifying to alleged sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor, and drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on government officials to enhance their ability to anticipate challenges and effectively implement policies amidst a turbulent global environment. He emphasized the difficulty of promoting Chinese modernization and high-quality development due to the complex external situation. Li's remarks come as China faces increasing tensions with the West over trade and technology issues, including ongoing negotiations with the United States and preparations for a trade summit with the European Union. Despite these challenges, both American and Chinese officials have agreed to a framework aimed at de-escalating disputes over rare earths and strategic technologies.

          <p>China is entering the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to major advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has announced the production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light for information transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance, overcoming limitations in high-speed optical links. TFLN's unique properties, including its ultra-fast electro-optic effect and low power consumption, are expected to drive significant progress in the field, positioning China as a major player in future technologies.</p>

Former staff at Ticketmaster-owned resale sites claimed they worked closely with touts, and court documents revealed staff bought tickets for touts. Touts were offered financial incentives by resale sites, and one tout was allegedly offered a meeting with a top Ticketmaster lawyer to brainstorm ways the company could help them. Ticketmaster denies the allegations, stating they refer to outdated claims about long-defunct businesses, but the investigation raises questions about the company's commitment to fair ticketing.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border as part of efforts to ease tensions between the two nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the move to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts were resumed in June of the previous year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons sent to the South. The decision is seen as a proactive step to reduce military tensions and alleviate the burden for South Koreans residing in border areas, though prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain uncertain.</p>

U.S. curbs not only inhibit China's access to the world's most advanced chips but also restrict technology vital for creating an AI chip ecosystem. Despite mobilizing billions of dollars, China still lags behind in key segments like AI chip design, fabrication, and equipment. Huawei's Ascend 910B GPU is considered a significant step, but China faces challenges in mass-producing advanced GPUs and securing advanced chipmaking equipment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect mixed reactions to the chancellor's Spending Review, with some describing it as "renewing Britain" while others call it a "reckless splurge." The Daily Express warns of potential tax increases, while the Guardian highlights the NHS and defense as "big winners." The Daily Mail criticizes the review as a spending spree that voters will be paying off for years, and the Metro dubs it the "spend of austerity." The Times suggests the chancellor will have "no choice" but to raise taxes, and the Daily Telegraph claims the police and defense are being "sacrificed." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les MisÃ©rables' at the Kennedy Center against the backdrop of immigration protests in Los Angeles, creating a stark contrast. The musical, which tells the story of a rebellion against authoritarianism, sparked ironic commentary given Trump's deployment of troops to quell the protests. The event was marked by a mix of cheers and boos, and several drag queens attended in response to Trump's criticism of the venue. Trump's appearance was intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, but the event was overshadowed by the political climate and cultural tensions.</p>

The Mace B cruise missile launch site, constructed in the 1960s, is the last remainder of four such sites. The United States occupied Okinawa from 1945 to 1972, and deployed nuclear weapons on the island despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. The missiles, deployed in the 1960s, could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, and were reportedly made ready for war during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
