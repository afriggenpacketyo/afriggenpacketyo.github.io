          <h2>Therapy Culture Linked to Generational Childlessness, Essay Argues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 16:59:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that heightened awareness of childhood trauma and the emphasis on emotional well-being have contributed to an elevated, possibly unattainable, standard for parenting. This generation may be hesitant to become parents themselves, fearing they will not meet these standards and potentially inflict harm on their children, while societal factors such as economic pressures and climate change concerns also play a role. The essay highlights how redefined notions of harm and abuse have influenced perspectives on parenthood.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to an executive order aimed at defunding the public broadcaster, arguing that the order violates both the U.S. Constitution and existing telecommunications law. The lawsuit asserts that the president is attempting to control PBS's programming and editorial independence, which is legally prohibited, and that the executive order infringes on speech and press freedoms. PBS contends that the order is retaliatory, stemming from perceived political slights in the network's news coverage. This legal action follows a similar suit filed by NPR, reflecting widespread concern over the administration's efforts to curtail funding for public media.</p>

          <p>Republican senators Eric Schmitt and John Cornyn are set to co-chair a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to investigate Joe Biden's cognitive abilities during his presidency, alleging a media cover-up of his supposed mental decline. This probe follows concerns raised by Republicans, including Cornyn, who penned a letter to the Justice Department requesting an investigation into potential misrepresentations about Biden's health. The hearing aims to address constitutional issues surrounding a potentially "mentally incompetent president" and who was truly in charge, with some Republicans calling for Jill Biden to testify regarding her husband's condition. The move comes after the release of a book making claims about the Bidens' capacity for denial and lack of transparency regarding health issues.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 87 in her New York home, with her representative citing natural causes as the likely reason. Swit garnered two Emmy Awards and multiple nominations for her portrayal of the Army nurse in the Korean War-era comedy, which ran for 11 seasons. She sought to bring depth to her character, moving beyond the "Hot Lips" moniker and exploring Houlihan's evolving personality as the show progressed. Swit's career spanned both stage and screen, but it was her role on M*A*S*H that solidified her legacy in television history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, a week after suggesting he approved a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details about the structure of the deal, which Trump has described as a "partnership." While U.S. Steel has portrayed the agreement as a merger, where it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, questions remain about how the deal will be structured and how U.S. interests will be protected. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick has indicated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" to ensure U.S. control and production levels.</p>

Ernst argued that the focus is on removing ineligible individuals from Medicaid rolls to protect benefits for the most vulnerable. Constituents expressed concerns that the cuts, part of a broader Republican effort to advance President Trump's agenda, would threaten access to healthcare and food benefits. The House-passed bill aims to reform Medicaid and extend the Trump 2017 tax cuts, adding trillions to the national debt.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Elon Musk is "not really leaving" his administration despite the conclusion of his 130-day term as a special government employee. During an Oval Office news conference, Trump and Musk defended the work of DOGE, the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, and vowed its continuation. Trump indicated that Musk would continue to be "back and forth" to the White House, describing DOGE as "his baby." Musk, in turn, insisted that DOGE will continue to relentlessly pursue $1 trillion in reductions. The meeting occurred days after Musk expressed disappointment in Trump's "big, beautiful" bill, which includes tax breaks and increased defense spending.</p>

          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's latest import tariffs unlawful, but the tariffs remain in place while the administration appeals the decision, creating uncertainty for business owners. The tariffs, announced in April, include a 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods and higher tariffs on Chinese, Canadian, and Mexican imports. Business owners report difficulties in planning due to fluctuating import costs, and some may be eligible for refunds if the ruling is upheld. Small businesses are making operational adjustments, such as discontinuing certain products, to cope with increased expenses.</p>

          <p>Costco reported strong third-quarter results, with net sales increasing by 8% to $61.96 billion and earnings per share rising to $4.28. Analysts attribute Costco's success to its ability to absorb tariff and inflation pressures due to its scale, resulting in an 8.1% increase in adjusted comparable sales. The company's performance has led to positive reactions from analysts, with some suggesting a potential stock split. Costco's ability to pass through costs without affecting traffic highlights the strength of its membership model and positions it for continued market share gains, even amidst a challenging consumer environment.

          <p>Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, alleging that the supermarket chain is copying its packaging to mislead customers into buying store-brand products.

Mondelez is seeking monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products. Aldi has faced similar accusations in the past, including a ruling against them in a U.K. appeals court earlier this year.</p>

CEO Jay Chaudhry noted that the proliferation of AI is driving the need for AI security and that the company is increasing its investments in this area.

          <p>The case of an Italian tourist kidnapped and tortured in New York City over his cryptocurrency holdings highlights a growing trend of "wrench attacks," where criminals use violence to steal digital assets. These attacks are becoming more frequent due to the rising value of bitcoin and the relative ease of stealing digital wallets compared to traditional bank accounts. The crypto world's culture of flaunting wealth also makes it easier for criminals to identify potential targets. Experts recommend crypto investors take steps to protect themselves, such as requiring multiple permissions to access a wallet and keeping a lower profile.</p>
