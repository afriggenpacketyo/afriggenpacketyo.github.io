          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs triggered an immediate and sharp decline in US stock futures.  The Dow plummeted over 1,000 points, reflecting fears of a global trade war. Shares of companies heavily reliant on imported goods suffered the most significant losses, highlighting the potential economic consequences of the new trade policy.  The president, however, framed the tariffs as a move towards economic independence and the revitalization of American industry.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a new policy requiring city-funded needle distribution programs to actively connect drug users with treatment and counseling. This marks a significant shift from previous harm reduction strategies, driven by concerns over rising overdose rates.  The policy aims to address the city's fentanyl crisis more aggressively, but critics warn it could lead to increased risks of overdose and infectious diseases due to a shortage of treatment resources.  The policy also restricts the distribution of smoking supplies.</p>

          <p>A US advisory firm suggests that Beijing's efforts to curb oversupply in the solar panel industry are insufficient to significantly impact global prices.  While recent government measures aim to limit expansion and improve quality, a sharp market correction is not anticipated.  The report predicts a gradual price recovery, with current low prices primarily attributed to existing manufacturing capacity.  The report also notes that recent price increases in China are linked to increased solar panel installations following a new policy.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attributed the recent stock market sell-off primarily to a decline in major technology stocks, rather than President Trump's new tariffs.  He cited the emergence of competitive AI models from a Chinese startup as a key factor in the tech sector's downturn.  While acknowledging the S&P 500 briefly entered correction territory following the tariff announcement, Bessent emphasized the tech sell-off as the more significant driver of market volatility.  The statement downplays the immediate market impact of the tariffs.</p>
