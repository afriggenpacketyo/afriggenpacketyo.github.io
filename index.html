          <h2>Qatar Considers Donating Jumbo Jet for Presidential Use</h2>

          <p>According to CBS News, the royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, potentially to be given to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office. However, Qatar's Media Attaché to the U.S. stated that the transfer is under review, and no decision has been made, disputing reports of an immediate gift. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has called for an investigation into the ethics and legality of accepting such a gift from a foreign government, citing concerns about federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause. The White House insists that any gift would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel and facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. A senior Palestinian official indicated this move is a goodwill gesture before President Trump's visit to the Middle East, with a meeting scheduled to finalize the release process, requiring a temporary halt to Israeli military activity. President Trump confirmed the release on Truth Social, calling it "monumental news." Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen held hostage in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, with both sides reporting progress amidst ongoing tensions between the two countries.

While acknowledging remaining sources of friction, He emphasized China's opposition to the trade war initiated by President Trump.

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to exclude Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, a decision that will force many Americans to switch to a drug that may be less effective for them. Despite research indicating that Zepbound leads to more weight loss, Caremark cites lower drug prices as the reason for the change, a move that has sparked criticism from patients and doctors. This decision highlights the influence of pharmacy benefit managers and secret deals between drugmakers, leading to restrictions on medication choices for patients. Doctors argue that both drugs should remain available, as patients respond differently to each, and the change may disrupt effective treatments for individuals who have found success with Zepbound.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has granted refugee status to a group of 49 white South Africans, citing racial discrimination and persecution, under a program announced in February. This decision has drawn criticism from refugee groups who question prioritizing this group over those fleeing war and natural disasters, as vetting for refugee status often takes years. The South African government denies the claims of persecution and racism, asserting that Afrikaners are among the most economically privileged in the country. The relocation effort is expected to expand, with the White House emphasizing that the situation fits the definition of why the refugee program was created.</p>

          <p>The nomination of Edward Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia collapsed, leading to the surprise announcement of Jeanine Pirro as his replacement, sparking mixed reactions. Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate, faced criticism for his political activism and controversial social media posts. Pirro's selection, while criticized by some Democrats, has garnered support from Republicans, potentially smoothing her path to confirmation. Martin will instead be assigned to a Justice Department task force, while Pirro, a former judge and prosecutor, will need to shift from her provocative TV pronouncements to uphold the Justice Department's tradition of impartiality.</p>

          <p>Former President Rodrigo Duterte, facing international court charges of crimes against humanity, remains popular in the Philippines, especially in Davao City where he served as mayor for 22 years. His arrest and extradition to The Hague has sharply divided the country, with some polls showing a majority backing the investigation, while many supporters view him as a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte's case is being used as a campaign tool, with supporters demanding his return, and his daughter, Sara Duterte, sees her approval rating rise, though she faces impeachment charges herself. The upcoming midterm elections could prove pivotal for her political future amid this turmoil.</p>

          <p>California, despite its status as the world's fourth-largest economy, faces rising signs of difficult times ahead, including a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles and the aftermath of devastating wildfires. Analysts suggest the state's population could decline due to the fires and immigration crackdowns, while many young people are moving out of state due to the housing shortage. The state's vulnerability is compounded by an adversarial relationship with the federal government, hindering its ability to secure federal assistance after the fires. Despite these challenges, some leaders remain optimistic about California's resilience, citing its history of overcoming disasters and reinvention.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that it would hurt profits and innovation. The order would likely impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, but not common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientists in Switzerland have developed a "digital bridge" to help people with severe spinal cord injuries regain movement and other bodily functions. The technology sends signals wirelessly from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. While walking again is a priority, patients also seek to restore bladder function, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. Spinal cord stimulators may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's disease regain mobility. Clinical trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of these therapies.</p>

Mr. Zelensky responded cautiously to the Russian counteroffer of direct talks, insisting again on a halt in the fighting.

Migrants will also have to wait 10 years to apply to settle in the UK, instead of automatically gaining settled status after five years, under the plans. Labour's long-awaited migration rules, to be published on Monday, will "create a system that is controlled, selective and fair," the prime minister said. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the idea Sir Keir "is tough on immigration is a joke" and promised to push Parliament to introduce cap on migration.</p>
