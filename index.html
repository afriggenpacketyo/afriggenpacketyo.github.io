          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of Christopher Pelkey, a victim of a 2021 road rage incident, during the sentencing of his killer. The AI avatar delivered a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised, but the use of AI in legal proceedings has ignited debate about potential manipulation and emotional compounding. Legal experts are divided, with some raising concerns about the slippery slope of altered evidence and others seeing no ethical issue in its use during sentencing without a jury. The video opened with a disclaimer clarifying that it was an AI recreation using the victim's picture and voice profile.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. attorney for Washington D.C., replacing Ed Martin. Pirro, a longtime ally of Trump, previously served as a Republican district attorney and judge. The move comes after Trump withdrew his first pick for the job due to Republican opposition in the Senate. Pirro's appointment raises legal questions about bypassing Senate confirmation processes, while Martin will become director of the "weaponization working group" within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is initiating the removal of approximately 1,000 openly transgender military members, following a Supreme Court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban. A directive gives those who have yet to openly identify as transgender 30 days to remove themselves, with medical records being used to identify others. This action aligns with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's views on gender roles and comes amid concerns about military recruitment and healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans. Critics argue the move is discriminatory and forces individuals to make decisions under duress, potentially losing benefits.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means as Surgeon General has drawn criticism due to her background in functional medicine and lack of a current medical license. Critics, including Laura Loomer and Nicole Shanahan, question her qualifications and wellness practices, while supporters like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defend her ability to inspire Americans to rethink healthcare. The debate centers on whether a non-practicing physician with a focus on holistic therapies is suitable for the role, which oversees public health initiatives and requires specialized training or experience in public health programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the UK, but details reveal limited substantive benefits for the US, while the UK still faces higher tariffs than before. The deal involves the US rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel in exchange for expanded opportunities for American beef, ethanol, and agricultural products in the UK. While some in the UK express relief, analysts note that the deal provides Trump with a political victory without significant changes. The announcement drew criticism from American carmakers who pointed out the reduced tariffs would make UK-made cars less expensive than many of their models made in Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist stance. While the U.S. deal could boost trade, concerns remain about its impact on India's domestic manufacturing ambitions. Experts suggest that even with zero tariffs, some sectors may not be significantly affected due to factors like transportation costs and market dynamics. Potential winners from the deal include financial, materials, healthcare, and logistics companies, while losers could be those that fail to reach an agreement.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to relax its rule requiring players to wear skorts, with county and club teams advocating for the option to wear shorts. A Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, after the Kilkenny and Dublin teams were forced to change into skorts before a match. A Gaelic Players Association survey found that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to choose shorts. While some argue it's a minor issue compared to larger challenges in women's sports, many players feel it's a matter of comfort and player welfare.</p>

          <p>The acquittal of three former police officers in the state trial over the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has added to a mixed series of verdicts for officers accused of wrongdoing. The defense successfully argued for a jury from outside Memphis and deflected blame onto other officers involved. The verdict has sparked outrage and disappointment in Memphis, with some seeing it as evidence of a system that gives leeway to law enforcement. The case underscores the difficulties in proving excessive force beyond a reasonable doubt and the influence of perceptions about police safety.</p>

          <p>A directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led to significant curriculum changes at West Point, including canceled classes and the removal of readings focusing on race, gender, and darker aspects of American history. This has sparked concerns about academic freedom and the politicization of the academy, with some professors resigning in protest. The changes reflect a broader culture war and the challenges of balancing academic independence with military directives.
