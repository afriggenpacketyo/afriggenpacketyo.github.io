          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University for at least six months, citing concerns that the institution is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students. The proclamation also directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. studying at Harvard. Trump claims Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries," and has discriminated in their admissions practices. The move follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program. </p>

While inflation has eased, the economy has been sluggish, and the ECB warned that uncertainty surrounding trade would weigh on business investment and exports.

          <p>The New York Police Department ( NYPD ) has started issuing criminal summonses for bike riders committing a slew of seemingly low-level fouls. Now, if caught running red lights, stopping in the pedestrian crossing or wearing headphones, wayward cyclists must appear before a judge, even if they are not contesting the fine. If they do not, they risk arrest. The article discusses the increased enforcement against cyclists in New York City.</p>

Demand is weak, and lower revenues from the auction are bad news for lawmakers who are already trying to plug a $12bn budget deficit. The poor showing is also a signal that firms are not confident that California’s cap-and-trade programme, the fourth-largest carbon market in the world, will continue to exist.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the concept of the “summer body” has evolved into a year-round pressure to maintain a certain appearance, fueled by social media, fitness trends, and weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. It argues that while the body positivity movement challenged traditional beauty standards, the current fitness and wellness boom has created a more constant and potentially toxic pressure to be constantly working on one's body. The author suggests that this shift has led to fatigue and a sense of never-ending projects with no clear endpoint. </p>
