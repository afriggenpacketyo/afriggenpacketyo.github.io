          <p>Three men have been charged in the UK with targeting journalists working for Iran International, an independent media organization critical of the Iranian regime. Mostafa Sepahvand, Farhad Javadi Manesh, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori are accused of conducting surveillance with the intent to inflict serious violence on the journalists. The investigation is led by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasizing that Iran must be held accountable for its actions.

          <p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has released a report detailing how the white nationalist group Patriot Front is using combat sport clubs to recruit new members. These "Active Clubs" serve as smaller networks where members train in mixed martial arts and bond over white nationalist ideologies. The clubs maintain an online presence to encourage radicalization, allowing Patriot Front to expand its reach while evading law enforcement. Since 2023, hate groups have increased by 14%, with Active Clubs present in at least 34 states.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings has lowered the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over increasing government debt and rising interest costs. The agency notes that successive administrations have failed to address the trend of large fiscal deficits. The downgrade is expected to slightly increase yields on U.S. Treasury debt and could negatively impact sentiment towards U.S. assets. The U.S. is currently running a significant budget deficit, with interest costs continuing to rise due to higher rates and increased debt financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey by Kyodo News reveals that over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will reach its target of having women in 30% of top corporate roles by 2030. They cite slow shifts in views among male-dominated executives and the need to change company culture as major obstacles. The survey, conducted on 41 senior women, also highlights the effects of traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues as reasons for the imbalance. Despite these doubts, most respondents would encourage younger generations of women to pursue senior positions.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. This marks the steepest single-year decline in 45 years, bringing deaths back to pre-pandemic levels. The drop is widespread across 45 states, with synthetic opioid deaths falling the fastest. Factors contributing to this decline include the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, opioid-settlement cash, and tougher enforcement on fentanyl. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>

          <p>Manvir Singh's book, Shamanism: The Timeless Religion, explores the widespread phenomenon of shamanism, which offers a technology for dealing with uncertainty through non-ordinary states. The article discusses how neo-shamanism has looped into conspiracy theory and far-right ideologies, and examines the role of shamans in art and poetry. It also touches on the shift in focus from the tribe to the individual in modern shamanism, and the use of trauma and harmful thinking in place of witchcraft and resentful spirits.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S. has sparked debate about the decline of Hollywood. While the proposal has been walked back, it highlights the competition from other countries offering tax incentives and cheaper labor. Even within the U.S., states are vying for production jobs. California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal tax credit to motivate studios to create more work locally. Despite the challenges, there's no consensus on how best to stimulate the film industry.</p>

          <p>Axios released snippets from a 2023 interview with former President Joe Biden that led Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur to describe him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The audio reveals Biden's halting tone and difficulty remembering dates, particularly around the time of his son Beau's death. Staff members can be heard correcting him on certain details. While a written transcript was released last year, the audio provides context on Biden's demeanor during the session. Biden's verbal delivery was a key part of Hur's report, which ultimately recommended against charging Biden with a crime.</p>

To offset these effects, they are likely to rely on strong sales of popular fuel-efficient models and consider price increases. While increasing local production is a long-term option, immediate price hikes pose a risk of driving away customers. Toyota plans to focus on local development and production, while Honda considers moving production of some models to the United States from Japan and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>
