        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a significant drop in its stock value, falling over 8% after announcing a 59% plunge in its first-quarter net profit. The airline attributed the decline primarily to lower interest income and a share of losses from associated companies, specifically noting the financial impact of its 25.1% stake in Air India. Despite the profit downturn, the company reported that overall demand for both air travel and cargo services remains strong amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. The results reflect new accounting changes following the Vistara-Air India merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a popular nightclub in the Turks and Caicos Islands left three people dead and ten others wounded in what officials are calling an unprecedented act of violence for the territory. The attack, which occurred early Sunday at the Hookah and Cigar Lounge, involved at least four suspects who remain at large. Premier Charles Washington Misick linked the incident to gang-related violence, noting its concentration in Haitian communities and urging cooperation with law enforcement. Authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest as they work to combat the rise in violent crime.</p>

In return, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make significant investments.

The encounter, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy, free-wheeling press session, allowed Starmer to build a personal rapport with the unpredictable American leader. While this access is seen by Downing Street as crucial for aligning on key issues like Gaza, it also presents risks, forcing Starmer to carefully navigate Trump's spontaneous commentary on various topics. This article analyzes the blend of personal business and international diplomacy that characterizes Trump's approach to foreign relations.</p>

          <p>Two senior officials in the Justice Department's antitrust division, Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, have been abruptly fired, reportedly for insubordination. Their dismissal follows reports of growing internal friction within the division, which is responsible for investigating anticompetitive behavior and challenging monopolies. The division's head, Gail Slater, has faced criticism from colleagues and business leaders over the handling of major investigations into companies like T-Mobile and Capital One. The ousters highlight ongoing tensions within the Trump administration regarding the direction and aggressiveness of its antitrust enforcement policies and merger reviews.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking an injunction that would allow him to play for the USC Trojans this season. After the NCAA denied his waiver request for a final year of eligibility, Wingfield is challenging the organization's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive. His collegiate journey was disrupted by the pandemic and a significant knee injury, factors he believes should have warranted an exception. The lawsuit claims the NCAA's denial threatens him with irreparable harm by preventing a valuable NIL opportunity and the chance to enhance his professional prospects at a high-profile program.</p>

          <p>An Ohio family has reported their monthly electricity bill from AES Ohio nearly doubled, rising from under $200 to almost $400, reflecting a wider issue of rising energy costs for consumers. The utility company attributes higher bills to increased air conditioning use during hot weather and has formally applied for a rate increase, which is pending approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. To manage costs, the company suggests using high-consumption appliances at night. The affected customer found relief by switching to a third-party supplier, a strategy that successfully cut her bill in half while public hearings on the rate hike are scheduled.</p>

Cramer notes that investors may have "tariff ennui," as the pattern of threatening high tariffs followed by a negotiated deal has become familiar.
