          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a boost in March, marking the third consecutive month of growth, primarily driven by the sunny weather which increased demand for clothing and DIY products. The Office for National Statistics reported a 0.4% rise in sales volumes, indicating a positive impact across various sectors due to the warmer climate. However, food sales, particularly in supermarkets, continued to struggle, showing a decline in consumer spending in that area. Despite the recent positive trend, analysts cautioned that consumer confidence dipped in April, suggesting a potential end to the current sales increase (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>With the number of foreign nationals residing in Japan reaching record highs, foreigner associations are urging Japanese politicians and the public to acknowledge their contributions and create better immigration policies. At a recent event in Tokyo, discussions centered on addressing the perception of foreigners primarily as a source of labor, advocating for their recognition as valuable members of society. Panelists highlighted concerns about the lack of relevant parties involved in immigration policy-making and the need for forums where foreign residents' voices can be heard. A lawyer noted that the increase in foreign residents is driven by the economy, and measures for social integration may not keep pace.</p>

          <p>The president of the US-China Business Council suggests that the U.S. may overestimate its leverage in ongoing tariff negotiations with China. He argues that China has been preparing for this situation since 2018 and does not feel the same urgency to reach a deal. The speaker also highlighted that Beijing views the US tariff policy as part of a broader strategy to contain China's growth, making a quick resolution unlikely. The comments come after President Trump indicated consideration of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals High Rate of Abuse Against Japanese Public Servants</h2>

          <p>A government survey in Japan revealed that 35% of local government officials have experienced overbearing or abusive behavior from residents, significantly higher than in the private sector. The survey suggests that public officials, considered "servants of the whole community," regularly face unreasonable requests from taxpayers. The government has submitted an amendment bill requiring companies and municipalities to take steps to address customer abuse. Attitudes are slowly evolving, moving away from the traditional acceptance of customers as "gods."</p>

          <p>Migrants subject to removal from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act are given approximately 12 hours to decide whether to contest their removal, a timeframe deemed insufficient by lawyers. The ACLU argues that this short period violates a Supreme Court order requiring a "reasonable time" to appeal. The government is sending Venezuelans accused of gang membership to a prison in El Salvador under the act. Detainees receive a form in English, and while it is read to them in their language, it does not explicitly state they can challenge their removal.</p>

          <p>The Post Office has paid over £600 million to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite deciding to replace it more than a decade ago. The original 1999 deal with Fujitsu meant the Post Office did not own the code for the core system, preventing them from building a replacement. This reliance on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The Post Office finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software in 2023, but issues with the system persist.</p>
