          <p>The company is pausing its restaurant modernization plans after significant public outcry over a logo change caused a major drop in its market value. Acknowledging that the redesigns did not align with customer preferences, Cracker Barrel has suspended remodels for its 660 locations, reinforcing its commitment to its traditional "Old Country Store" image. This decision follows a period of financial stagnation for the chain, which had initially pursued the brand overhaul to stimulate growth and appeal to a wider audience.</p>

The mandate will initially apply to those near its Redmond, Washington, headquarters before expanding to other U.S. and international locations. In a memo, the company's HR chief stated the change is not about reducing staff but about fostering collaboration and energy needed for developing AI products. This move marks a shift from the more flexible hybrid model Microsoft adopted during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all felony charges against 15 individuals who signed documents falsely claiming Donald Trump won the state in the 2020 election. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence of intent to defraud, stating the individuals were exercising their right to seek redress. The decision was criticized by the state's attorney general, who argued the evidence of their intent to deceive was clear, while supporters of the accused celebrated the ruling.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria's defense industry, with its specialization in Soviet-era ammunition, has become a crucial supplier for Ukraine's war effort. Initially, these arms deliveries were kept secret to avoid Russian interference, but the country is now openly slated to produce a significant portion of the artillery shells promised to Ukraine by the EU. German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall is also investing €1 billion in a new ammunition plant in Bulgaria, signaling a strategic shift for the country's industry towards producing NATO-standard munitions.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 former UFC fighters are set to receive substantial payments from a $375 million settlement in a landmark class-action antitrust lawsuit. The case, filed in 2014, accused the UFC's parent company, Zuffa, of using monopolistic practices to suppress fighter pay. With a nearly 97% participation rate from eligible fighters, the net fund of over $251 million will be distributed based on a formula of total compensation and number of bouts, with the highest-earning claimant projected to receive over $10 million.

          <p>The latest "Nation's Report Card" reveals a continued decline in the academic performance of U.S. students, with average scores for 8th and 12th graders dropping in science, math, and reading between 2019 and 2024. The data, from the National Center for Education Statistics, shows that fewer students are meeting proficiency standards in these core subjects. Officials described the results as "sobering," noting that the downward trend began before the COVID-19 pandemic and that the achievement gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students is widening.</p>

          <p>In a written State of the State address, California Governor Gavin Newsom depicted his state as a defensive bulwark against a hostile Trump administration. He accused the federal government of undermining public services and using bullying tactics, casting President Trump as the primary obstacle to the state's progress. Instead of a traditional in-person speech, Newsom's address highlighted California's resilience in areas like disaster response and clean energy while framing the current political climate as a battle to protect democratic values.</p>

A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson stated that he has long regretted his association with Epstein, while the Prime Minister's office affirmed its continued confidence in the ambassador.</p>

          <p>An attack by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an ISIS-affiliated rebel group, has left at least 60 people dead in Eastern Congo. The assailants used machetes and guns to attack a group of people attending a funeral ceremony in the town of Nyoto on Monday night. This is the latest act of extreme violence by the ADF in a region where numerous armed groups compete for control over valuable mineral resources, preying on the local population. The massacre has been condemned as a serious violation of international law.</p>

          <p>Eligibility for Medicare is based on age (65 or older) or disability status, not on a person's income level. However, higher earners are subject to an Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which increases the monthly premiums they pay for Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and Part D (prescription drugs). These adjustments are based on tax returns from two years prior, meaning recent retirees may face higher costs initially. Financial planning strategies can help mitigate these income-based surcharges.</p>

Hill's attorney has dismissed the allegations as a "smear campaign" intended to secure a larger financial settlement. Hill is not currently facing any criminal charges related to these claims.</p>

The rankings assess trusts on metrics including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial health, sorting them into four segments. The government defended the tables as a tool for public transparency, while some health organizations criticized the methodology, arguing it could be confusing for patients and may not accurately reflect the quality of care.</p>
