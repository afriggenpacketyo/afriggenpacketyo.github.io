          <p>The United States and Japan have announced a significant trade deal that establishes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports, including a reduction for automobiles from the previous 25% rate. President Trump stated that the agreement includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The deal is seen as a potential political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and prompted a strong positive reaction in Japan's stock market, particularly for auto manufacturers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile are raising concerns about 'overtourism,' citing the presence of 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous street. This proliferation has displaced essential local businesses like grocers and butchers, making daily life more difficult for the people who live there and contributing to a decline in the local primary school's enrollment. While the tourism industry supports thousands of jobs, locals feel the area no longer serves their needs, and the city council faces criticism for leasing many properties to these tourism businesses.</p>

          <p>Despite a difficult retail environment in the U.K., the specialty store 'Duck World' has managed to stay afloat by selling a wide variety of collectible rubber ducks from prime London locations. The business faces pressures from inflation and tariffs on Chinese-made goods but benefits from the consumer trend of 'treatonomics,' where people buy small, affordable luxuries to boost their mood. While some analysts question the long-term viability of such a niche, fad-driven business, its founders remain optimistic about the iconic appeal of the rubber duck.</p>

          <p>China and the European Union are preparing for a high-level summit in Beijing amidst an already strained relationship over trade, technology, and security issues. Analysts have low expectations for major breakthroughs, suggesting the meeting's primary success may be that it is happening at all. The dynamic is further complicated by U.S. trade policies under President Trump, which create a shared challenge for the EU and China but also risk exacerbating their own bilateral frictions, particularly if the U.S. pressures the EU to adopt a harder line on China.

          <p>The family of a man who died following a heart procedure at Castle Hill Hospital in the UK claims the hospital covered up its mistakes by issuing two different death certificates. The first certificate cited a failed procedure as a cause of death, but the hospital replaced it with a second one that omitted this information. An unpublished review, seen by the BBC, was highly critical of the man's care and noted the inaccurate death certification, part of a wider police investigation into multiple deaths at the hospital.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed key relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation after he left a game feeling a 'stinging sensation' in his forearm. While his absence is a blow to the team's bullpen, both the manager and general manager expressed optimism that the injury is not season-ending and that he will return. The injury underscores the team's acknowledged need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>A professional violinist from Worcestershire has spoken out about her frustrating experience with police after she was cyberflashed by a man she had met once.

She chose to share her story to highlight that the crime needs to be taken more seriously and to encourage other victims not to feel shame.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has instructed all national sports governing bodies to comply with President Trump's executive order regarding transgender athletes. This new policy effectively bars transgender women from competing in women's sports categories, a move the USOPC says is an obligation due to its status as a federally chartered organization. The decision has been strongly condemned by civil rights groups like the National Women's Law Center as a capitulation to political demands.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece posits that July 2025 is becoming a 'summer of capitulation' to President Trump, citing recent events as evidence. The article points to the cancellation of 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' by Paramount Global and the House GOP's decision to recess early to thwart an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that these actions demonstrate how corporations and political entities are increasingly bending to pressure from the White House to avoid conflict.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the remote Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, an 18th-century vessel with a storied past.
