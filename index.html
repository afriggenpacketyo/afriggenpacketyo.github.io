        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan has reignited its national and international debate on capital punishment following its first execution in five years, just months after a Constitutional Court ruling narrowed the death penalty's scope. Supporters cite public opinion and retributive justice, while opponents, including the European Union, argue it violates human rights and undermines Taiwan's democratic progress. The execution of Huang Lin-kai, who was convicted of a double murder, has been criticized by human rights groups as politically motivated and a disregard for due process. This has placed Taiwan's stance on the death penalty in stark contrast with many of its other progressive social policies.</p>

          <p>The Church of England has named Dame Sarah Mullally as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to hold the principal leadership role in its nearly 500-year history. A former chief nursing officer for the NHS, Mullally became the Bishop of London in 2018 and will now succeed Justin Welby, who resigned amidst a safeguarding scandal. Her appointment is a landmark moment for the Church, which first ordained female priests in 1994, though it has drawn criticism from conservative Anglican factions. She will face significant challenges, including rebuilding trust after abuse scandals and navigating divisions over issues like same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have announced that one of the two victims in the recent terrorist attack outside a synagogue may have been fatally wounded by a police officer's gunshot. The suspect, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, was not believed to be armed with a firearm, leading investigators to consider the death a tragic consequence of police action to stop the attack. Another hospitalized victim also sustained a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, while the attacker was shot and killed by officers at the scene. The investigation into the vehicle and stabbing attack continues as authorities assess the complex and tragic events.</p>

          <p>In an unusual development following a mass shooting at a Michigan Latter-day Saints church, a fundraiser has been organized to support the wife and children of the deceased attacker, Thomas Jacob Sanford. The organizer, a fellow church member, cited a religious duty to care for the fatherless and widows, noting the family is also a victim of the tragedy and has a son with serious medical needs. The attack, which authorities believe was motivated by anti-Mormon hatred, killed four people and injured eight before Sanford was killed in a shootout with police.

          <p>A Maryland immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year despite having a legal status protecting him from removal. Abrego Garcia was later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. His lawyers sought to reopen his immigration proceedings to apply for asylum, but the judge found insufficient evidence that his removal was imminent. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that his final order of removal stands, leaving his long-term status in the United States uncertain as he remains in detention.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has warned of a potential "drawdown" in equity markets within the next one to two years, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. He noted that the current AI-driven market enthusiasm has likely run ahead of the technology's actual potential, leading to overextended risk-taking by investors. While avoiding the term "bubble," Solomon suggested that a market reset is probable as capital deployed into AI ventures fails to deliver expected returns, causing a shift in investor sentiment. This caution echoes similar concerns from other financial leaders about the sustainability of the current market rally. (not investment advice)</p>

Some policy experts argue that extending the subsidies fails to address the root causes of high healthcare costs and would add billions to the national debt.

The legislation, which has already passed the state legislature, aims to reduce exposure to the toxic compounds linked to serious health problems. Industry groups argue the ban is unnecessary, would harm businesses, and unfairly targets them, while public health and environmental advocates say it is a critical step to eliminate avoidable uses of dangerous chemicals.

          <p>After nearly 34 years, a major breakthrough has been made in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Law enforcement announced that new DNA and ballistics technology has linked the crime to Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died by suicide in 1999. This development brings potential closure to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted after coerced confessions and spent years in prison. The advancement highlights the power of modern forensic science in resolving decades-old cold cases and identifying previously unknown perpetrators of heinous crimes.</p>

The report finds that the diets of the richest 30% of the global population are responsible for over 70% of the food system's environmental pressures.

His strategy involves consistently investing 15% of her income, which includes earnings from a second job, and taking full advantage of her employer's 401(k) match. This advice comes as many Americans express low confidence in their retirement savings, with median account balances falling far short of what is needed for a comfortable retirement. The guidance emphasizes disciplined, process-driven investing and leveraging catch-up contributions to build wealth later in life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has stated he has "no problem" with Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, or Jack Grealish, despite leaving the prominent players out of the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia. Tuchel explained the decision was made to maintain the cohesion of the group that achieved a decisive 5-0 victory over Serbia in their last outing. He acknowledged that Bellingham, who is returning from injury, wanted to be included but noted the midfielder has not yet regained his full rhythm at Real Madrid. The manager stressed that the omission was tactical and not personal, aiming to reward the previous squad's performance.</p>

          <p>Munich airport experienced significant disruptions after multiple drone sightings forced a temporary halt to all air traffic on Thursday evening. The precautionary closure led to the cancellation of 17 flights and the diversion of 15 others, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers. German police, with assistance from a helicopter, searched the area but found no suspicious individuals. The incident, which German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt called a "wake-up call," is the latest in a series of similar drone-related shutdowns at European airports, raising concerns about aviation security and the need for enhanced drone defense systems.</p>

Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 97 years, arguing the brutal nature of the crime against innocent children warrants severe punishment. In contrast, Sweeney's defense is requesting a 40-year minimum sentence, citing the "immeasurable trauma" he experienced during a deeply troubled childhood as a mitigating factor. The case highlights the tragic outcome of familial tensions and a history of abuse, culminating in a devastating triple homicide.</p>

He is accused of using his service pistol to commit the killings in February 2024, following what police described as months of predatory behavior. The case, which involves the first murder charge against a serving NSW officer in decades, has prompted a review of police firearm procedures.</p>

The incident reportedly occurred while Miller was livestreaming his solo climb on TikTok, where he was known to his followers as "orange tent guy." According to his brother, Miller had completed the ascent of the "Sea of Dreams" route and was hauling his gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope. Miller was an internationally recognized alpinist, celebrated for feats such as the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, and his death has been met with an outpouring of grief from the climbing community.</p>

          <p>This article suggests President Trump may be following Richard Nixon's 1970s playbook by pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy ahead of midterm elections. This strategy risks long-term economic damage, as Nixon's interference led to rampant inflation that took years and a severe recession to control under Fed Chair Paul Volcker. Despite a currently solid economy, Trump has already called for significant rate cuts, appointed a key economic advisor to the Fed board, and may attempt to oust Chairman Jerome Powell. Such a move could destabilize financial markets but might serve the president's short-term political goal of securing a favorable Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Stop Illegal Entry Act, a Republican-led bill that would impose mandatory minimum prison sentences for migrants who re-enter the country illegally and commit other crimes. The legislation proposes a five-year minimum for those committing a crime punishable by over one year, and a ten-year minimum for crimes punishable by up to two years. While proponents argue it's a necessary deterrent, critics and criminal justice groups warn it would lead to mass incarceration, overwhelm federal courts and prisons, and impose draconian penalties on non-violent offenders.

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the recent call by film industry figures to boycott Israeli cinema, asserting that such actions are ill-conceived and counterproductive. The author uses the award-winning film "The Sea," an Israeli-funded production about a Palestinian boy, as an example of the critical and nuanced stories emerging from the country's film industry. The article contends that Israeli cinema, though partially state-funded, often serves as a powerful medium for questioning militarism and the occupation, thereby influencing public opinion from within. A boycott would stifle these vital voices of dissent at the same time they face pressure from Israel's own right-wing government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new initiative, TrumpRx, a government website intended to offer discounted prescription drugs, alongside a voluntary deal with Pfizer to lower its prices for Medicaid. However, health policy experts are skeptical about the actual impact of these measures, suggesting they are more of a publicity move than a substantive solution to high drug costs. Critics point out that similar discount services already exist and that the confidential nature of the Pfizer deal makes it impossible to verify any real savings for taxpayers or patients. The announcements stand in contrast to the ongoing, more impactful Medicare drug price negotiations program.</p>

While Aston Martin is not expected to be a top contender for pole position, the result is encouraging for the team on a low-speed track that suits their car's high-downforce design.
