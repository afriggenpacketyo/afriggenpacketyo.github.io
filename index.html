          <p>Multiple people were injured in an attack at Boulder's Pearl Street Mall during a march for Israeli hostages; the suspect is now in custody. Witnesses reported that the suspect attacked people with Molotov cocktails, resulting in burn injuries, and two victims were airlifted to a burn unit. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the FBI involved, and are working to determine if it was a terrorist attack, though it's too early to speculate on the attacker's motive. Colorado's Governor Jared Polis condemned the act as a "heinous act of terror," and the Jewish community expressed sadness and concern, emphasizing community safety and support for the injured. </p>

She is working with Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill has also sparred with other Jan. 6 defendants over her views on the Capitol riot, expecting her protest to garner Trump's attention.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap election on June 3rd after President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law decree caused economic and political turmoil. The ruling conservative party faces losing votes due to the martial law debacle, which voters blame for weaker consumption and export momentum. Liberal Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls, promising stability after months of upheaval, and voters trust him to revive the economy more than conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo. Voters are closely watching economic pledges as consumption has been badly hit, and a win for Lee could spur faster economic growth in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia, despite its relatively small population, has produced a surprising number of successful actors in Hollywood. This phenomenon is attributed to factors such as the training provided by institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), a strong work ethic, and a lack of self-importance among Australian actors. NIDA emphasizes classical training, experimental theater, and accent work, preparing actors for international roles. The distance from Hollywood also allows Australian actors to develop their talents without the constant scrutiny of the industry.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating an attack in downtown Boulder, Colorado, where multiple people were injured, and a suspect is in custody. Police responded to reports of a man with a weapon and people being set on fire, finding victims with burn injuries. While the governor called it a "heinous act of terror," local police are not yet labeling it as such, and are investigating whether a pro-Israel protest was targeted. The attack has heightened tensions in the United States amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza.</p>
