          <p>Hurricane Erin has strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph as it moves through the Caribbean. While not currently forecast to make landfall on the U.S. mainland, its outer bands are expected to bring heavy rainfall and potential flooding to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Federal emergency agencies have pre-deployed personnel to the region as a precaution, and forecasters warn the storm will likely grow in size, creating rough seas across the western Atlantic.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup survey, the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level since tracking began in 1939. The decline is attributed to growing public awareness of the health risks associated with even moderate drinking, a shift from previous beliefs that some alcohol could be beneficial. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, with teen drinking rates falling significantly over the past two decades, signaling a major public health success.</p>

The alert affects recent guests from 38 states and seven countries who occupied eight specific cabins at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May and July. Although bats tested so far have been negative for rabies, officials are recommending prophylactic shots for some individuals as a precaution, since a bat bite or scratch can go unnoticed.</p>

          <p>Recent market data indicates that Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is largely attributed to Samsung's innovative foldable phones and a wider range of price points, which contrast with Apple's more static iPhone design. The trend is increasing pressure on Apple, with analysts speculating that the company may soon introduce its own foldable device or a new, slimmer form factor to reignite growth.</p>

          <p>A rising number of older Americans are facing homelessness, a trend described by experts as a "national scandal" driven by soaring housing costs and economic instability. In response, healthcare organizations like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), which are funded by Medicare and Medicaid to help frail seniors live at home, are now increasingly forced to intervene in the housing crisis. These groups are partnering with developers or even building their own housing to ensure their vulnerable clients have a place to live.</p>

          <p>Shortly after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced that he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. In a social media post, Trump stated that the goal of the upcoming talks is to move "directly to a Peace Agreement" to end the war, rather than pursuing a temporary ceasefire. This development marks a significant new phase in the administration's efforts to broker an end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A memorial tree planted in honor of Ilan Halimi, a Jewish man who was brutally murdered in an antisemitic attack in Paris in 2006, has been cut down.

          <p>California has officially approved a groundbreaking conservation plan aimed at protecting the western Joshua tree from the long-term threats of climate change and development. The strategy is notable for its forward-looking approach, seeking to preserve a species that is currently widespread but projected to lose most of its habitat. The plan includes new regulations and fees for removing trees, a measure that has drawn praise from conservationists but criticism from local residents and officials concerned about economic impacts.</p>

          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times contends that the Trump administration's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a deliberate political distraction. The author suggests the move is not a response to an actual crime emergency, as crime is at a 30-year low, but rather an attempt to divert public attention from the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. The article frames the action as a cynical abuse of power designed to serve the president's personal interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent deployments of federal troops and agents in cities like Los Angeles and Washington D.C. are being analyzed as an unprecedented expansion of executive authority. Critics argue these actions, often justified by claims of uncontrolled crime that contradict official data, serve as politically motivated shows of force rather than legitimate law enforcement operations. This trend is sparking fears among legal and political experts about the erosion of norms and the potential for authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>In the wake of President Trump's decision to deploy federal forces and assume control of the local police department, many teenagers in Washington D.C. report feeling more fearful and unsafe. Young residents expressed concerns about being intimidated or unfairly targeted by the heavy police presence, arguing that true public safety is built on community trust rather than an overwhelming show of force. Their perspective highlights the tension between the administration's crackdown and the lived experience of the city's youth.</p>

          <p>A new study published in PLOS Biology reveals that young chimpanzees develop their methods of combining vocalizations and gestures by learning from their mothers and maternal relatives, not their fathers. Researchers observed that family members related through the mother shared similar communication patterns, suggesting the traits are socially acquired rather than genetically inherited. This finding provides insight into the evolution of communication, indicating that social learning has been a key feature in our lineage for millions of years.</p>
