          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is projected to intensify significantly, bringing dangerous rip currents and potential coastal flooding to the U.S. East Coast. While not expected to make direct landfall, the Category 3 storm's outer bands will impact areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations are in effect. Forecasters warn of hazardous ocean conditions and high waves for much of the week, urging residents to heed local warnings. This event underscores the escalating activity of the Atlantic hurricane season as it approaches its peak.</p>

          <p>India Walton, a Democratic socialist who won a primary but lost the general election for Buffalo mayor, warns U.S. progressives against moderating their political messages. She argues that compromising on issues like charter schools and police funding cost her crucial support and ultimately contributed to her defeat. Walton believes the Democratic Party has alienated working-class voters by abandoning populist economics. She advocates for bolder progressive stances, drawing lessons from her experience and the recent success of Zohran Mamdani in New York City.</p>

          <p>The MAGA movement is increasingly promoting cow-derived products, such as beef tallow and raw milk, for health and wellness, a trend endorsed by figures like Robert F. Kennedy and Donald Trump. This "cow mania" is seen as aligning with a romanticized, traditionalist vision of America, appealing to those who idealize a bygone era. Despite scientific skepticism regarding some health claims, the movement's influence extends to consumer choices, with some restaurants adopting beef tallow. This cultural phenomenon reflects a broader embrace of "cow-based wellness" within conservative circles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has effectively ended the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, resuming loan interest charges for millions of federal student loan borrowers. This policy reversal is causing significant financial distress, forcing individuals to allocate hundreds more dollars monthly towards payments or lose progress on loan forgiveness. Borrowers express dismay, feeling their financial futures are jeopardized, impacting aspirations like homeownership and starting families. The decision is seen by some as a move to keep borrowers in debt longer.</p>

          <h2>Study Indicates Doctors May Develop Over-Reliance on AI for Medical Diagnosis</h2>

          <p>A new study published in "Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology" raises concerns about doctors becoming overly dependent on artificial intelligence. The research found that Polish gastroenterologists, after using an AI-assisted system for colonoscopies, showed a 20% decrease in their ability to detect polyps independently when the AI was inactive. This suggests a potential "safety-net effect" where human skills may degrade with AI integration. While some experts question the study's duration, it highlights the need for further research into AI's impact on clinical practice.</p>

          <p>Republicans risk losing ground with Latino voters by pursuing an extreme conservative social agenda, despite recent gains under Donald Trump. The article argues that both major parties have misjudged this diverse electorate: Democrats by treating them as a monolithic group focused solely on social justice, and Republicans by assuming they would universally embrace hardline conservative stances. Polls indicate Latino voters are increasingly dissatisfied with both parties, expressing concerns over immigration enforcement and economic issues.

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the Trump administration's demand for a $1 billion settlement from UCLA, ostensibly to combat antisemitism, is a "dangerous charade" and a "Mafia-style shakedown." The author contends that the true aim is to undermine institutional autonomy and academic freedom, rather than genuinely addressing campus antisemitism. While acknowledging antisemitic incidents, the article warns against the "weaponization" of the issue and calls for broad alliances to defend both UCLA and the broader American higher education system from illiberal agendas.</p>

          <p>This opinion article supports combating antisemitism on campuses but questions the Trump administration's disproportionate financial penalties for it, asking why anti-Black racism doesn't receive similar accountability. The author highlights generations of severe anti-Black harassment, including racial slurs and threats, with FBI data showing high rates of racially motivated hate crimes against Black students. The piece argues that while antisemitism warrants a strong response, the lack of comparable federal action and financial consequences for pervasive anti-Black racism on campuses reveals a troubling disparity.</p>
