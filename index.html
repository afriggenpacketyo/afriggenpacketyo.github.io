          <p>A major legislative package passed by Congress significantly benefits the oil, gas, and coal industries while ending long-standing federal support for renewable energy. The new law opens more federal lands and waters to drilling, slashes royalty payments for producers, and enhances tax credits for carbon capture used in oil extraction. Conversely, it phases out crucial investment and production tax credits for solar and wind projects that have been instrumental in their growth since the early 2000s. Renewable energy industry groups have warned this could stifle investment and lead to the closure of U.S. manufacturing facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has fallen for the fifth consecutive week, now standing at 6.67%.

Key recommendations include checking and improving one's credit score to qualify for better rates and researching experienced real estate agents. Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is also highlighted as a crucial step to demonstrate financial readiness to sellers and stand out among other buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Austria has deported a 32-year-old Syrian man convicted of a crime, marking the first such removal to Syria since its civil war began over 15 years ago. The Austrian Interior Minister framed the action as part of a "tough but fair" asylum policy, signaling intent to remove criminals from the country. This move makes Austria the first EU nation to repatriate someone to Syria, a country it now deems safe for return following the end of the civil war. Human rights organizations have expressed concern, arguing the situation in Syria under its new Islamist government is still uncertain and that this could set a precedent for other nations.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old photographer and Ph.D. student is seeking $1 million in damages from the Department of Homeland Security after he was arrested while filming an immigration raid at a Home Depot. The man, a U.S. citizen, alleges he was tackled, detained for over 24 hours, and suffered physical and emotional harm despite asserting his citizenship. This incident occurs amid escalating immigration enforcement actions, with White House pressure reportedly pushing for increased arrests.

          <p>A warning from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito about a "potentially significant loophole" in a recent ruling that curbed nationwide injunctions is now looming over legal challenges to Trump administration policies. Alito cautioned that class-action lawsuits or suits brought by states could be used to achieve the same broad effect as a universal injunction, effectively blocking a policy's implementation across large areas. His concerns are being highlighted after a federal judge recently used a class-action certification to set aside a Trump asylum policy, a move the administration is appealing. Alito urged lower courts to be vigilant against potential abuses of these legal tools to prevent undermining the Supreme Court's original decision.</p>

The minister stated that someone arguing antisemitism was rational would not be allowed into the country.

          <p>A new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the largest tax cuts from the recently passed Republican legislation will go to the wealthiest 1% of households in specific states. The top earners in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, which do not have state income taxes, are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces other benefits for high-income households and business owners, while its cap on state and local tax deductions has less impact in these states. Conversely, the wealthiest in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see comparatively smaller benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

The High Court found that evidence from a senior MI5 official was not fair or accurate, prompting calls for greater accountability and a review of how the agency presents evidence in the future.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread internal opposition and broken promises, Republican lawmakers in Congress passed President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," demonstrating the president's tight control over the party. Fiscal conservatives who had vowed to protect the national debt and moderates who pledged to defend Medicaid ultimately fell in line to meet Trump's July 4th deadline. The article highlights how key senators like Josh Hawley and Ron Johnson, who had initially raised strong objections to the bill's spending and healthcare cuts, eventually reversed their positions under pressure. This political maneuvering occurred even though polls show the legislation is deeply unpopular with the public.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Trump's signature legislative package after an all-night session, sending the massive bill to his desk for final approval. The 218-214 vote was delayed by an eight-hour, 44-minute speech from Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who condemned the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs. The legislation extends tax cuts, introduces new tax relief, and significantly increases funding for defense and immigration enforcement, including mass deportations. Despite concerns from both moderate and fiscally conservative Republicans, party leadership successfully wrangled the necessary votes to pass the bill.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The passage of the Republican "big, beautiful bill" marks a significant shift in American health care, primarily through substantial changes to Medicaid. The legislation is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to cut over $1 trillion from the program, potentially causing nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance. The bill establishes a work requirement for Medicaid for the first time and restricts how states can finance their share of the program's costs. Health policy experts warn that these changes will lead to fewer people receiving medical care, more uncompensated care for hospitals, and ultimately, worse health outcomes for many Americans.</p>

Edward Kelley was convicted in November of plotting to attack and kill FBI agents who were investigating his role in the Capitol attack, creating a "kill list" of federal and local law enforcement personnel. Prosecutors argued he was seeking to incite a "civil war" and showed no remorse for his actions.

Formerly working long hours in TV production for $100,000 a year and living paycheck to paycheck, she now earns about $30,000 as a university teacher. In China, this salary allows her to "live large," save up to $1,000 a month, and work only 18 hours a week, giving her time for hobbies and travel.

However, Alito's statement is being interpreted as an invitation for anti-abortion lawyers to bring a more straightforward case to the court.

After Musk threatened to start his own political party if the bill passed, a hashtag supporting him went viral in China, with many users encouraging his political ambitions. The conflict began with Musk's strong criticism of the bill's impact on the national debt, which prompted Trump to retort that Musk's businesses rely on government subsidies.

He also discusses the mental side of the sport, which he works on with his partner, a professional golfer, and a shared psychologist. Looking ahead, Albon is realistic about his team's journey, stating that while he expects continued progress, he believes 2028 is a more realistic target for Williams to be fighting at the front of the grid.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000 against their home's equity, the choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) currently presents similar initial costs. With average interest rates for both products hovering around 8.26%, the monthly payments are nearly identical. However, the key difference lies in their rate structures; home equity loans have a fixed rate, ensuring predictable payments, while HELOCs have variable rates that can change over time. This means that while a HELOC could become cheaper if market rates fall, it also carries the risk of becoming more expensive if rates rise. (not investment advice)</p>
