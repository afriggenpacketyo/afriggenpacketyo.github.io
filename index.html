        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a legislative package aimed at countering federal immigration enforcement. The new laws include a first-in-the-nation ban on most law enforcement officers, including federal agents, wearing face coverings during official duties. Additional measures restrict immigration agents from accessing nonpublic areas of schools and healthcare facilities without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of on-campus immigration operations. The move has drawn sharp criticism from the Department of Homeland Security and is expected to face legal challenges from the federal government over state jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Bruno Fernandes celebrated his 200th game for Manchester United by scoring his 100th goal for the club, leading them to a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. The team captain's performance was praised by manager Ruben Amorim, who highlighted his crucial influence on the squad and his passionate leadership on the field. Despite criticism of his temperament and occasional defensive lapses in a deeper midfield role this season, Fernandes's commitment was evident throughout the match. His contributions are seen as vital to the team's successes, though Amorim noted there is still room for improvement from both the player and the team.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Tampa International Airport discovered human remains, including a partial skull, inside a passenger's luggage. The traveler, who had initially only declared cigars, informed officials that the bones were intended for ritualistic use. The remains were found wrapped in foil within a duffel bag during an agricultural inspection that flagged prohibited items. Citing serious health risks, CBP officials seized and destroyed the bones, highlighting the unpredictable nature of customs inspections and the strict CDC regulations for importing human remains.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has flown its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. Two RAF Typhoon jets, supported by a refueling aircraft, patrolled the skies to signal NATO's commitment to defending its eastern flank. The mission, dubbed "Eastern Sentry," was initiated after 19 Russian drones entered Poland's airspace on a single day, an escalation that also saw subsequent violations over Romania and Estonia. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the operation sends a clear message that NATO airspace will be defended against reckless Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Approximately 6,000 residents in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district were evacuated overnight while authorities worked to defuse a 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered at a construction site and contained an estimated 500 pounds of TNT. Bomb disposal experts worked for nearly ten hours, braving typhoon conditions, to successfully neutralize the threat without any injuries. This is not the first such discovery in the city, which was targeted by U.S. air raids during the Japanese occupation in WWII.</p>

          <p>The White House has denied that pressure from the Trump administration led to ABC's decision to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely. The suspension followed Kimmel's on-air remarks connecting the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. Prior to the suspension, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr had publicly threatened to review ABC's broadcast license over the comments, calling them "truly sick." The situation has ignited a fierce debate about free speech and "cancel culture," with figures from across the political spectrum, including Barack Obama and Ted Cruz, criticizing the FCC's perceived threats against the network.</p>

They argue that public statements by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for his execution and a highly publicized "perp walk" have unconstitutionally prejudiced the case against their client. The defense claims the decision to pursue capital punishment was political and has tainted the legal process, violating Mangione's right to a fair trial. This legal challenge comes after state-level terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed, though he still faces separate state and federal murder charges.</p>

          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, author of "Love by Design," a lack of respect is a critical red flag that can severely damage a romantic relationship over time. Disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, such as one partner consistently being inconsiderate, or in more significant ways, like devaluing a partner's priorities, commitments, or identity. Nasserzadeh explains that such behavior can erode the other person's self-esteem and sense of self. She advises addressing these issues through open conversation, but notes that if the behavior doesn't change, it may be a sign the relationship is not worth continuing.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 deadline looming, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a deal to prevent a government shutdown. In their letter, the Democratic leaders accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government funded. Both parties are blaming the other for the impasse after competing short-term spending bills failed in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed openness to a meeting but stated there was little to discuss if Democrats would not support a "clean" stopgap funding bill.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with "sanctuary states," warning California, New York, and Illinois that they could face lawsuits and funding cuts for not honoring ICE detainer requests. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with requests to hold undocumented immigrants for federal custody, accusing them of obstructing enforcement and releasing "criminal aliens" into communities. The states have laws limiting cooperation with ICE, citing potential liability and constitutional concerns, and argue these policies build trust with immigrant communities. The administration has vowed to involve the Department of Justice to pursue legal action against the states.</p>

          <p>Joanna Page, star of the popular British sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has revealed in her new book that she was groped by a television host during filming. She claims that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy" and would likely touch her. Page stated that halfway through the recording, the host began groping her, and she forcefully told him to stop, after which he desisted. She described the producer's warning as a bizarre but common experience at the time and has not named the individual involved for legal reasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to prevent U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising new "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel informed nearly 800 workers of a planned shutdown, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit it, leading U.S. Steel to reverse its decision. This marks the first use of the national-security agreement tied to the acquisition, underscoring the administration's increasing influence in the private sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what was described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was reportedly made online before a performance in Ottawa, Canada, where police subsequently charged a 26-year-old man. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, scheduled performances at Boston's MGM Music Hall and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were called off. All tickets for the canceled shows will be refunded, and Morrissey's tour is currently scheduled to resume in Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>A study from China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute claims the creation of an advanced AI system capable of detecting even stealth submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The system reportedly integrates data from multiple sources, such as sonar buoys and water temperature, to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While the announcement suggests a potential game-changer that could undermine the effectiveness of submarine-based nuclear deterrents, Western military experts remain cautious. They acknowledge AI's potential but emphasize the extreme complexity of the underwater environment and the ongoing arms race between detection and stealth technologies.</p>

A recent home defeat to Crystal Palace marked the team's fourth loss in five Premier League games, intensifying scrutiny on Potter's position. Sources indicate that even before the latest loss, the club had begun identifying potential replacements, with names like Nuno Espirito Santo and former manager Slaven Bilic being discussed. Appointed in January, Potter has won only six of his 25 matches, and the team has not secured a home league victory since February.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new restrictions requiring journalists to sign a pledge not to report on any information, including unclassified material, that has not been officially authorized for release. Failure to sign will result in the revocation of their press credentials, and their movements within the building will also be more limited. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the move, stating the press does not run the Pentagon and must follow the rules of a secure facility. The policy has drawn strong condemnation from press freedom advocates, who call it a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint on publication.</p>

          <p>The release of Apple's new, thinner iPhone Air is being viewed by some critics as a symbol of a broader, undesirable trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and culture. In a commentary piece, this article argues that this spartan aesthetic, seen in everything from interior design to theater, strips away character and context in favor of a cold, unobtrusive style. The author contrasts the new iPhone with the colorful, maximalist iMacs of the late 1990s, suggesting that today's sleek minimalism is a dishonest facade for a world of digital chaos. The article posits that this trend reflects a desire for control in an uncontrollable world, ultimately leaving people feeling hollow.</p>
