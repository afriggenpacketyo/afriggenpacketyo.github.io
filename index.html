          <p>Brooke Hogan has publicly addressed her exclusion from her late father Hulk Hogan's $5 million will, stating it was her own request. The WWE legend, who passed away in July, left his entire fortune to his son, Nick. Brooke explained that she and her father had been estranged for a considerable period, not due to a single major conflict, but a series of private disagreements and a growing distance. She emphasized her independence, asserting she has been self-sufficient without his financial support for a long time. Despite the family rift, Brooke expressed peace, knowing she had always deeply loved and supported him through various life challenges.</p>

International competitors from various cities, including Hong Kong, Rio de Janeiro, and San Diego, showcased their operating prowess before thousands of enthusiastic spectators. The event featured a series of innovative and quirky tram-based challenges, such as "tram bowling" where a giant ball was used to knock down inflatable pins, and "tram curling," which involved pushing a bicycle trolley to a precise target. These challenges, alongside tests of smooth braking and acceleration, celebrated the unique skills required in public transport, with Poland and Norway securing second and third places, respectively.</p>

The event, which saw an estimated 150,000 participants, experienced escalating tensions as some individuals assaulted officers with kicks, punches, bottles, and other projectiles while attempting to breach security cordons. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the "wholly unacceptable" violence, and 25 arrests were made. The rally, which included a video appearance by tech billionaire Elon Musk, underscored growing anti-immigration sentiment and ongoing debates surrounding free speech in Britain, alongside a smaller counter-protest organized by Stand Up To Racism.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are firmly prioritizing healthcare provisions as a critical sticking point in ongoing negotiations to prevent a government shutdown, with federal funding poised to expire on September 30. Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, have declared their unwavering opposition to any Republican-backed spending bill that fails to extend Affordable Care Act tax credits and reverse proposed Medicaid cuts. Republicans, however, including President Donald Trump, have rejected these demands, accusing Democrats of deliberately instigating a shutdown. This deep partisan divide sets the stage for a contentious legislative battle, making a temporary funding solution or a government shutdown increasingly probable as the deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>West Ham manager Graham Potter is under intense scrutiny and facing mounting pressure following a deeply disappointing start to the football season. The team has suffered two successive home defeats, conceding eight goals while scoring only one, culminating in a 3-0 loss to Tottenham that drew boos from the remaining fans. Despite bolstering the squad with five summer signings, defensive frailties remain a significant concern, with West Ham conceding more headed goals and set-piece goals than almost any other team. While the club's ownership typically shows patience, the current poor form and a slip into the bottom three, coupled with a tense atmosphere and challenging upcoming fixtures, raise serious questions about Potter's long-term tenure.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has lodged a strong accusation against the United States, claiming a U.S. destroyer "illegally and hostilely" seized one of its fishing boats for eight hours in its exclusive economic zone. The Venezuelan foreign ministry stated that the USS Jason Dunham deployed 18 armed agents to board the "small, harmless" vessel carrying nine tuna fishermen. Caracas condemned the incident as a "direct provocation," asserting it seeks to escalate conflict in the Caribbean to facilitate regime change. This accusation further heightens already strained relations between the two nations, exacerbated by recent U.S. deployments of warships to counter drug cartels and increased bounties for Venezuelan President Maduro's capture.</p>

          <p>Confidential military planning documents, as reported by the Washington Post, indicate the Pentagon has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops to conduct law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge. This move aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to combat crime in Democratic-led cities, though critics view it primarily as a political display of power rather than an effective crime-fighting strategy. The plan details a mobilization extending until September 2026, where National Guard personnel would augment local law enforcement, aid in drug interdiction, and offer logistical support. This proposal, awaiting formal approval and a request from Louisiana's Republican Governor, underscores the contentious issue of military involvement in domestic policing.</p>

This crucial status, which provided increased Medicare reimbursement and regulatory flexibility, was revoked by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) based on a newly reinterpreted rule. CMS now claims the hospital is three miles short of the required 35-mile distance to the next closest facility, despite local officials arguing for an alternative, qualifying route. The closure will force residents to travel at least 40 minutes for emergency care, displace 150 healthcare workers, and underscores the precarious state of rural healthcare access.</p>

Salvador Ramírez, a social communications coordinator for Mexico’s ruling Morena party, faced strong backlash, including a public warning from U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau about revoking visas for foreigners who glorify violence. The news network, Milenio, also issued an apology.

          <p>Downing Street, under Sir Keir Starmer, explicitly questioned Lord Peter Mandelson regarding his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein prior to his appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US. The Prime Minister's chief of staff sent Mandelson three specific questions, triggered by initial vetting that highlighted his association with Epstein. However, a notorious cache of emails, including supportive messages from Mandelson after Epstein's 2008 conviction, only came to light this week, ultimately leading to Mandelson's dismissal. Sources within No 10 suggest Mandelson was "economical with the truth" in his answers, intensifying scrutiny over the Prime Minister's judgment and the thoroughness of the vetting procedures for high-profile appointments.</p>

          <p>The U.N. General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted 142-10, with 12 abstentions, to endorse a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict and press Israel to commit to a Palestinian state. This nonbinding resolution, co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, supports the "New York Declaration," which condemns both Hamas's attacks on civilians and Israel's actions against civilian infrastructure in Gaza. Despite this broad international consensus, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately rejected the concept of a Palestinian state. The United States, which voted against the resolution, criticized it as a "misguided publicity stunt" and a "gift to Hamas," highlighting the profound diplomatic chasm that persists despite global calls for peace.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed a $3.1 million fine against Boeing for a series of safety violations, specifically citing issues related to the January 2024 in-flight door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9. The FAA's investigation uncovered hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and at its subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kansas. Findings from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) earlier indicated significant lapses in Boeing's manufacturing and safety oversight, compounded by inadequate FAA inspections. Boeing is reviewing the proposed penalty, affirming its commitment to enhancing its safety culture, improving first-time quality, and accountability across its operations to address these persistent challenges.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has approved several impactful and controversial bills that are set to significantly reshape children's educational experiences, now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's final decision. Key measures include Assembly Bill 715, which establishes a state Office for Civil Rights to address various forms of discrimination, including antisemitism, though critics worry it might curtail discussions on sensitive topics like the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Assembly Bill 1454 mandates a phonics-based "science of reading" approach, aiming to improve literacy scores, despite resistance from some educators favoring different methods. Furthermore, Assembly Bill 1264 seeks to eliminate ultra-processed foods from school meals, promoting healthier options, while Assembly Bill 564 reduces cannabis excise tax revenue, potentially impacting subsidized child-care programs.</p>

Between September 4 and 11, four synagogues and a private residence in Golders Green were smeared with a substance, while liquid was also thrown towards a school and over a car. Police described these incidents, which reportedly involved bodily fluids, as "revolting and appalling." Bold has been remanded to appear at Willesden Magistrates' Court, with local policing superintendent Zubin Writer emphasizing the serious nature of these allegations and ongoing support for the Jewish community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared that Memphis, Tennessee, will be the next American city to see National Guard troops deployed, as part of his administration's ongoing crackdown on crime in major urban centers. However, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, voiced his strong disapproval, revealing he was informed of this significant decision through President Trump's announcement on Fox News, not via direct consultation. Despite Memphis facing high crime rates, Mayor Young emphasized that the city's primary need is financial resources for crime intervention and prevention, rather than a military presence. He expressed concerns about the historical implications, particularly evoking images from the 1968 Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, and stressed the importance of a strategic, community-benefiting deployment.</p>

          <p>Fox News co-host Brian Kilmeade has generated significant controversy and outrage after suggesting "involuntary lethal injection" or to "just kill 'em" when discussing homeless individuals suffering from mental health issues who decline assistance. The remarks occurred during a segment analyzing the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee by a suspect with diagnosed schizophrenia and a history of arrests. While his co-hosts discussed the necessity of intervention for the homeless and mentally ill, Kilmeade's extreme comment was met with minimal immediate reaction on air. The clip quickly went viral, prompting a response from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who condemned the sentiment with a biblical quote, highlighting the stark divisions on addressing societal challenges.</p>

          <p>Wall Street concluded a stellar week, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieving multiple record highs, fueled by anticipation surrounding the Federal Reserve's imminent interest rate decision. Oracle's blowout earnings report and a greater-than-expected decline in the producer price index bolstered investor confidence in potential rate cuts. However, this optimism was tempered by a higher-than-anticipated consumer price index and an increase in weekly jobless claims, presenting a mixed economic picture for policymakers.

          <p>Nepal's eight major political parties have issued a joint demand for the reinstatement of the parliament, which President Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved following a wave of deadly anti-corruption protests. They contend that Poudel's action, taken upon the recommendation of newly appointed interim Prime Minister Sushila Karki, was unconstitutional and violated judicial precedents. The dissolution was a central demand of the "Gen Z" protest movement, which had led to over 50 fatalities in clashes with riot police. While President Poudel has urged restraint and called for new elections, the major parties insist that all demands, including new elections, must be addressed through a democratically elected institution, underscoring a significant political and constitutional crisis in the nation.</p>

          <p>Illinois lawmakers and local officials are demanding a comprehensive investigation into the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during a traffic stop in Franklin Park. Democratic U.S. House member Delia Ramirez asserted that the killing, which occurred near a school during drop-off hours, tragically illustrates the "inevitable violence" resulting from the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaign. ICE claims Villegas-Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged an officer, though surveillance videos depict a struggle and agents forcibly entering his vehicle after it crashed. This incident, part of ICE's "Operation Midway Blitz" in the Chicago area, has ignited public outrage and intensified scrutiny over the agency's enforcement tactics, with officials emphasizing that a traffic violation should never escalate to a death sentence.</p>
