            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, during a White House meeting with Donald Trump, stated he would not return Kilmar Ábrego García to the U.S., a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador and held in a mega-prison. This decision defies a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to facilitate his return. Ábrego García, who had protection from deportation in the U.S., was deported due to an administrative error, though the U.S. claims he has gang ties. Bukele's refusal underscores the complex relations between the two countries, especially regarding U.S. deportees. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2024, the top 40 funded theatre companies opened 229 original productions, compared to 332 in 2014. Funding cuts, rising costs, and changing audience tastes are cited as contributing factors. Some venues are co-producing more shows to spread costs, but smaller-scale productions are being squeezed out. (not investment advice)</p>

Over half of the respondents cited cost as the primary reason for not reshoring, with others mentioning the challenge of finding skilled labor. The majority of respondents estimated that building a new domestic supply chain would at least double current costs. (not investment advice)</p>
