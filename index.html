          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted on two felony counts, making false statements and obstruction of justice, related to his 2020 Senate testimony regarding the FBI's "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation. Attorney General Pam Bondi alleged Comey obstructed a congressional inquiry by falsely denying he authorized an anonymous source, a claim Comey denies. This indictment, celebrated by President Trump, marks an escalation in his efforts to target political opponents, with Comey asserting his innocence and confidence in the judicial system. The charges were brought just days before the statute of limitations expired, under an interim U.S. attorney with no prior prosecutorial experience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a new round of tariffs, effective October 1, including a 100% duty on branded pharmaceutical drugs (with an exemption for companies building U.S. manufacturing plants), 30% on upholstered furniture, 50% on kitchen cabinets, and 30% on heavy trucks. The administration justifies these measures by citing national security and protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. These tariffs are expected to impact consumer prices for medicines and housing costs, while economic data suggests previous tariffs have contributed to rising inflation and job cuts in manufacturing. Trump, however, maintains the tariffs are leading to "unbelievable success" despite these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed a 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S., effective October 1, with an exemption for companies that begin building manufacturing plants domestically. This announcement follows earlier threats of even higher tariffs, potentially reaching 250% in the future. The measure is part of a broader push that also includes new duties on heavy trucks and cabinetry, and expands national security investigations into other imported goods like robotics and medical devices.

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed the White House's threat of mass federal layoffs ahead of the October 1 government funding deadline as an "intimidation tactic." House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized OMB Director Russ Vought, accusing the administration of using federal workers as leverage in budget negotiations. Democrats are standing firm on their demands for health care priorities and have called for bipartisan talks, while Republicans control both chambers and the presidency. The article highlights the political stalemate, with Democrats asserting that a shutdown would be the GOP's responsibility.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, or reduction-in-force notices, in addition to furloughs, if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill by October 1. The memo also targeted programs "not consistent with the President's priorities," raising concerns among former officials about "enormous self-harm." While essential services like Social Security and military operations would continue, critics, including Democratic leaders, view this as an unprecedented and extortive move.

          <p>An unusually aggressive squirrel in San Rafael, California, has attacked several residents, leading to emergency room visits for bites and scratches. One 80-year-old woman described being startled by the squirrel on her leg during a walk, while another victim required stitches. The Marin Humane society confirmed the incidents, noting that such behavior is rare and likely stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, causing animals to lose their natural fear. The article emphasizes the dangers of habituating wild animals and the potential for disease transmission, though rabies is uncommon in squirrels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted a stark economic divide, with a robust sector fueled by the artificial intelligence boom contrasting sharply with a struggling consumer-oriented segment. He argues that the AI economy, dominated by Big Tech giants like CoreWeave and Meta, is indifferent to interest rates, while the consumer sector desperately needs rate cuts to prevent further decline. Cramer cited disappointing earnings from CarMax and KB Home, alongside Starbucks' store count reduction, as evidence of consumer weakness. This article suggests that while GDP growth appears strong, it's disproportionately driven by tech, with little intersection benefiting the broader workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

Other contributing factors include growing fast-food consumption, less frequent rubbish collection, and urban development.
