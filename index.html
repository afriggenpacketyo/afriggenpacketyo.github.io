          <p>Jim O'Neill has been appointed acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, following the controversial ouster of Susan Monarez by the Trump administration. Monarez and several other top CDC leaders resigned, many criticizing the administration's stance on vaccines and agency cuts. RFK Jr., a known vaccine skeptic and HHS Secretary, aims to "rebuild" the institution, a move that has generated significant turmoil and drawn bipartisan criticism. This leadership change highlights ongoing tensions regarding scientific independence and political influence within a crucial public health agency.</p>

          <p>A 25-year oil agreement between the Taliban and China's Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company has collapsed after just two years, marked by mutual recriminations. Afghan officials accuse the Chinese firm of breaching the contract by failing to deliver promised investments and royalties. Conversely, Chinese employees allege the Taliban forcibly seized oil fields at gunpoint and confiscated passports, effectively holding a dozen Chinese nationals hostage. This incident underscores the significant challenges and lack of rule of law in Afghanistan, complicating foreign investment efforts for both parties.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is advancing its "AI Plus" initiative, aiming to integrate artificial intelligence across manufacturing and service sectors. However, the agency emphasizes a tailored, rational approach to growth, cautioning against "disorderly competition and blind expansion" and urging regions to leverage their unique strengths. With targets for AI adoption set at over 70% by 2027 and 90% by 2030, the government plans to subsidize computing power and consumer access. This strategy highlights China's commitment to technological self-reliance while seeking controlled development.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort, notably supported by President Trump and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is advancing legislation to prohibit members of Congress and their households from trading stocks. The bill, which cleared its committee, aims to combat public corruption and restore American confidence in government, given past instances of lawmakers' stock trades intersecting with their committee work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted the ethical concerns and the importance of maintaining integrity in the financial system. This initiative reflects widespread public support for greater transparency and accountability from elected officials.</p>

          <p>The European Union is attempting to formulate a new "economic security strategy" to coordinate its economic tools and enhance its response to global challenges. However, efforts to screen high-tech investments in "risky" destinations like China and harmonize export controls have faced significant resistance from its 27 member states. Trade chief Maroš Šefčovič announced the doctrine, aiming for more efficient deployment, but top officials admit the bloc lacks the unified structures needed to act as decisively as the US and China. This highlights internal divisions hindering the EU's strategic autonomy.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is facing a significant legal challenge, as Cook has filed a lawsuit describing his actions as "unprecedented and illegal." Trump cited an unconfirmed mortgage allegation as grounds for immediate dismissal, despite Cook's term extending until 2038. Her lawyers argue the president lacks the authority to remove her without appropriate cause, making this case a critical test of the Federal Reserve's long-standing independence from political interference. A hearing is scheduled to address Cook's motion for a temporary restraining order.</p>

          <p>The 2025 NFL season could see several long-standing records broken, including Jacksonville kicker Cam Little's potential to surpass the longest field goal mark. Patrick Mahomes is on track to become the fastest quarterback to reach 250 career passing touchdowns, while Joe Burrow aims for a third 500-yard passing game, a feat only achieved by Ben Roethlisberger. Additionally, Ja'Marr Chase has a strong chance at Michael Thomas's single-season reception record, and the NFL's revised kickoff rule is expected to rejuvenate the return game, potentially boosting Keisean Nixon's pursuit of return touchdowns.</p>

While debates about further raising the limit to 70 years resurface due to demographic pressures, the current coalition government has ruled out such changes.

          <p>The UK government did not conduct its own cost analysis for the largest reorganization of English councils in decades, instead relying on a 2020 report that initially projected £2.9bn in savings. However, the County Council Network (CCN), whose analysis was used, has since revised its figures, now suggesting that the mergers could yield no savings or even incur costs, particularly if multiple small unitary authorities are created. Critics question the government's claims of improved services and taxpayer savings without independent verification, highlighting potential financial strains on local authorities.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley experienced psychological tactics from Alexander Zverev at the US Open, as Zverev deliberately delayed his arrival for their second-round match by over 10 minutes. Fearnley, despite his loss, viewed the incident as a valuable learning experience against top-ranked players who often control the match pace off-court. This event highlights the strategic gamesmanship in professional tennis and Fearnley's ongoing development in his early career, where he is also focused on improving his serve consistency under pressure.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, wife of the impeached ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, has been indicted on charges of bribery and stock manipulation, involving over $720,000 in illicit gains. Allegations include a stock manipulation scheme from 2010-2012, receiving free opinion poll data, and accepting bribes from the Unification Church. These indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into Yoon's martial law bid and his administration, which Yoon had previously vetoed while in office.

          <p>The Trump administration has ended the "de minimis" exemption, effective Friday, which previously allowed low-value parcels ($800 or less) to enter the US without tariffs. President Trump signed an executive order to close this "catastrophic loophole," asserting it was exploited to evade duties and funnel illicit goods, costing the Treasury billions. While a six-month transition period offers a flat duty option, this policy change, initially applied to China and Hong Kong, now extends to all nations, significantly impacting overseas retailers and the flow of inexpensive goods into the US.

Business owners like Helen Hickman, who halted US shipments, and Julian Boaitey, exploring US manufacturing, face challenges due to unclear upfront costs and new trade barriers. The Federation of Small Businesses is urging the UK government for more support, warning of a "chaotic mess" for exporters. (not investment advice)</p>
