          <p>Dell Technologies saw its stock climb after the company significantly raised its long-term financial outlook during an analyst meeting, signaling strong confidence in its future performance. The computer maker now anticipates annual revenue growth between 7% and 9%, a substantial increase from its previous forecast of 3% to 4%. This optimistic revision is largely attributed to the surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Dell positioning itself as a key provider of the necessary compute, storage, and networking solutions. The company also reiterated its robust fiscal 2026 forecast, which includes a plan to ship $20 billion worth of AI servers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their purchasing power, with many accounts currently providing returns that outpace the inflation rate. This article details the national average CD yields for various terms, while also highlighting that top rates from online banks are significantly higher, such as 4.45% APY for a 6-month term. To secure the best rates, consumers are advised to explore online banks, which have lower overhead, and consider short-term CDs, which presently offer higher yields due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi is scheduled for a contentious Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where she is expected to face intense questioning from Democrats regarding the alleged "weaponization" of the Justice Department. Key topics will include the controversial indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, which reportedly occurred over the objections of career prosecutors, and the department's handling of files related to the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The hearing follows a period of significant turmoil within the DOJ, with critics and former employees accusing the department's leadership of prioritizing political motives over national security and independent justice.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) represent affordable borrowing options in the current high-interest-rate environment. As of early October 2025, average rates for these products are notably lower than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards, with 10-year home equity loans around 8.36% and HELOCs averaging 7.89%. The article explains the difference between the fixed-rate, lump-sum home equity loan and the variable-rate, revolving credit line of a HELOC. It advises homeowners to shop around for the best terms, as rates can vary based on lender and credit profile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former FBI Director James Comey to testify in its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. The decision was made after Comey submitted a letter stating under penalty of law that he possessed no relevant knowledge or information regarding the committee's inquiry into the deceased sex offender's activities and government connections. Comey's letter, which was accepted in lieu of a deposition, asserted that he recalled no information about Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell during his tenures at the Department of Justice or the FBI. Similar subpoenas for other former officials have also been withdrawn after they provided comparable statements.</p>

          <p>Navigating the housing market remains challenging due to high mortgage rates, but securing an affordable loan is still possible for applicants with strong credit profiles. As of early October 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.34%, while a 30-year refinance rate stands at 6.64%. The article suggests that potential relief for borrowers may be on the horizon if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. To obtain the best possible rate, prospective borrowers are advised to strengthen their credit scores, pay bills on time, and compare offers from multiple lenders rather than only considering their current one.</p>

However, the outlook for the following year is less positive, with the WTO slashing its 2026 growth prediction from 1.8% to just 0.5%.

          <h2>DPD Delivery Drivers Protest Over Cuts to Parcel Payments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Some self-employed and franchised drivers for the delivery company DPD have initiated a three-day work refusal in protest of recent payment changes. The dispute centers on DPD's decision to cut the payment for deliveries of small parcels by 65p, a change one driver claimed could reduce his annual income by approximately £6,500. DPD stated that it adjusted rates to reflect a changing parcel profile and has increased pay for larger or heavier deliveries, alongside new incentives. The company does not anticipate a significant impact on its services from the action, but drivers argue the changes make it difficult to maintain their earnings without working longer hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is planning to impose significant tariffs of up to 50% on steel imports that exceed quotas, a move aimed at protecting its domestic industry from a flood of cheap Asian steel. However, the British steel industry warns that these measures could be "existential" for them, as the EU is the destination for 78% of the UK's steel exports. The dispute creates a challenge for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which has sought to reset post-Brexit relations with Brussels. UK steel producers are now lobbying for exemptions and for the British government to implement its own protective measures against foreign imports.</p>

Despite the positive quarterly results, the company reiterated its previously lowered full-year guidance, citing a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand. The beverage giant had earlier slashed its earnings outlook and now anticipates organic net sales to fall between 4% and 6% for the fiscal year. The company also noted ongoing concerns among its consumer base, particularly Hispanic customers, about the socioeconomic climate and potential job losses, which is affecting purchasing behavior.

The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development in the state. The project aims to secure domestic supply chains for minerals essential for energy infrastructure, defense, and manufacturing, reducing reliance on foreign sources.</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources generated more electricity globally than coal during the first six months of 2025, according to a report from the energy think tank Ember. This "historic shift" was primarily driven by rapid growth in solar and wind power, particularly in large economies like China and India, which were able to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. The analysis suggests a crucial turning point where clean energy growth is now sufficient to meet the rising global demand for electricity. While the US and EU saw a temporary increase in fossil fuel use, the overall trend points toward continued strong expansion of renewables.</p>

Homeowners are grappling with a combination of financial strains, including the rising costs of home insurance, property taxes, and general living expenses. While still below pre-pandemic levels, the increase in foreclosures highlights the vulnerability of households, where unexpected events like job loss or medical bills can lead to mortgage delinquency. Experts point to the slowdown in hiring and the impact of a high-interest-rate environment as contributing factors putting pressure on homeowners' ability to afford their monthly payments.</p>

This contrasts with Vietnam's previous steps, such as symbolically lifting a ban on same-sex marriage and declaring that homosexuality is not an illness. The cancellations have created uncertainty about the future of LGBTQ+ advocacy and whether the government's previously permissive stance is now changing.</p>

The single largest heist was a $1.4 billion theft from the crypto exchange ByBit. Researchers warn that hackers are increasingly targeting individuals, whose losses are less likely to be reported, meaning the total amount stolen could be even higher.</p>
