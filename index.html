          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded after being shot while responding to a wildfire near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Authorities believe the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders into an ambush.

The governor condemned the incident as a heinous assault on firefighters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis of federal data reveals a significant increase in the detention of immigrants with no criminal history since May, following a new White House directive. While the administration states its focus is on deporting criminals, the data shows that only about 8% of all detainees since January had convictions for violent crimes. The majority of detainees with criminal records were for non-violent offenses, with traffic violations being the most common. This shift has raised concerns among some lawmakers and immigration policy experts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate has begun a "vote-a-rama," a marathon session of back-to-back votes on numerous amendments to President Trump's domestic spending package. While most amendments, particularly those from Democrats, are not expected to pass, the process serves as a political tool to force senators to take public stances on controversial issues. For instance, a Democratic amendment to protect rural hospitals from funding cuts failed along party lines, though it gained support from two Republican senators.

Key events include disputes over steel, aluminum, and auto tariffs, as well as a recent flashpoint over Canada's proposed Digital Service Tax on U.S. tech companies.

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is developing a "temporary pass" system to shield certain industries, like farming and hospitality, from the negative impacts of intensified immigration enforcement. Acknowledging the reliance of these sectors on long-term immigrant workers, Trump stated the plan would allow farmers some control and ensure their businesses are not destroyed by the removal of their workforce. This proposal comes amidst a broader administration push to ramp up deportations, creating a complex balance between strict enforcement and economic considerations for key industries.</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed a scaled-back plan for reforming health and disability benefits, confirming that changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) will only affect new claimants. This decision follows a significant increase in the number of working-age adults claiming these benefits, rising from three million in 2019 to four million in 2025. A notable driver of this increase has been a rise in claims related to mental health conditions. Analysts suggest factors like the rising state pension age and greater public awareness of benefits may also be contributing to the trend.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania judge has ruled that three individuals, including a boxing trainer and a childhood acquaintance of Bryan Kohberger, must travel to Idaho to testify for the defense in his upcoming murder trial. Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022. The defense team had subpoenaed the witnesses, arguing their testimony is material to the case. This ruling is a key procedural step as both sides prepare for the trial, which is scheduled to begin in August and for which prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</p>

The scandal, which allegedly involves former government ministers, centers on fraudulent claims for non-existent farming operations. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has acknowledged failure and pledged to fight corruption, while several implicated ministers have resigned. The EPPO's 3,000-page file describes a "criminal organization" and has intensified pressure on the government, which is already facing accusations of cover-ups in other major scandals.</p>

          <p>British wildcard Arthur Fery, ranked 461st in the world, achieved a stunning upset on the first day of Wimbledon by defeating 20th-seeded Alexei Popyrin. The 22-year-old, who had never won a tour-level match before, triumphed in four sets to advance to the second round. Fery's victory was a highlight for the British players, who have their largest representation in the main draw in 41 years. His win followed another impressive debut victory for fellow Brit Oliver Tarvet, marking a successful opening day for the home contenders.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Dollar on Pace for Worst First-Half Performance in Over 50 Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 11:50:59 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is tracking for its worst performance in the first half of a year since 1973, having fallen over 10% against a basket of other major currencies in 2025. This significant sell-off has been driven by investor concerns over the economic impact of President Trump's trade policies and a ballooning national debt. Expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also weighed on the currency. The dollar's decline has pushed it to its lowest level since March 2022, while lifting currencies like the British pound to multi-year highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, a major coffee chain from China and a significant rival to Starbucks in Asia, has opened its first two U.S. locations in New York City. The company, known for its rapid growth and app-based, cashier-less model, has established storefronts in Greenwich Village and Chelsea. Since its launch in 2017, Luckin has expanded to over 24,000 stores in Asia. Its entry into the U.S. market marks a direct challenge to established players like Starbucks, bringing its tech-focused and often lower-priced model to American consumers.</p>
