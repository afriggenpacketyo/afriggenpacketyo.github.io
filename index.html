          <p>Authorities have arrested Mario Bustamante Leiva in connection with the theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse. Noem stated that the suspect was in the country illegally and described him as a "career criminal." The suspect faces charges of robbery and is under investigation by the United States Secret Service for potential device and credit card fraud. The purse was stolen from a Washington, D.C. restaurant and contained sensitive personal items, including Noem's driver's license, passport, DHS access badge, checks, and cash.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, the border czar, defended the deportation of a two-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras along with her deported mother, asserting that due process was followed. This stance contradicts a judge's suspicion that the government deported a U.S. citizen without proper procedure. Homan argued that the mother chose to take the child with her and had received due process during her immigration hearings. The case has sparked controversy, especially since another deported child was reportedly suffering from Stage 4 cancer.</p>

          <p>Canada is holding a snap federal election after Prime Minister Mark Carney called for a vote following Justin Trudeau's resignation and escalating trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump.

Key issues include the response to U.S. economic threats, the cost of living, and housing affordability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams did not draft a cornerback, fueling speculation about a potential return of Jalen Ramsey. The Rams traded Ramsey to the Miami Dolphins in 2023 but are now considering bringing him back to bolster their defense. While there are financial and contractual hurdles to overcome, a reunion would reunite Ramsey with Aubrey Pleasant, who coached him during his successful first stint with the Rams. The team is looking to improve its secondary after focusing on revitalizing its defensive front.</p>
