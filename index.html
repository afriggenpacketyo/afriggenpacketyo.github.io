        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily halted the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory (CRT), citing that the policy is unconstitutionally vague and causes confusion among teachers. The court found that the resolution lacked clear definitions and enforcement guidelines, leading to teacher self-censorship and a potentially incomplete education for students. The ruling reverses a previous decision and emphasizes the importance of clear educational standards. A separate part of the lawsuit regarding parental notification of student gender identity was deemed irrelevant due to existing state law protecting student privacy.</p>

While some are considered loyal to the new administration, others with more hardline views pose a potential threat, raising concerns among Western leaders about Syria becoming a haven for extremist groups.

          <p>Navigating debt relief can be complex, but understanding certain unexpected aspects can be advantageous. Being behind on payments might increase eligibility for credit card debt forgiveness, as it signals an inability to pay. Smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000 or more, may also qualify for debt relief services like credit card debt forgiveness. Moreover, taking out a debt consolidation loan could streamline debt payoff with a lower interest rate, offering a clear path to becoming debt-free. These features highlight the importance of exploring various debt relief options to find the best fit for individual circumstances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness can provide a path to becoming debt-free, but it generally does hurt your credit score. Settling a debt for less than what is owed is typically marked as "settled" rather than "paid in full," which can raise red flags for future lenders. Pursuing debt forgiveness often involves stopping payments, leading to late payments and charge-offs on your credit report. While the damage is not permanent, debt forgiveness stays on your credit report for seven years, with the impact lessening over time. Debt forgiveness can be a preferable alternative to bankruptcy and can stop wage garnishment, lawsuits, or a growing mountain of interest charges.</p>

          <p>An exotic dancer known as 'The Punisher,' Sharay Hayes, testified at Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial about how he discovered his client's identity. Hayes recounted an incident where he turned on a hotel suite television and the screen displayed, "Welcome Sean Combs." Hayes testified that he was hired to create "sexy, erotic scenes" with Combs' then-girlfriend, Casandra "Cassie" Ventura, while a naked man watched from the corner. The testimony is part of a larger trial where Combs faces allegations of racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim believes his team may be viewed differently if they win the Europa League final against Tottenham. Despite United's low Premier League position, faith in Amorim remains high at Old Trafford, and a defeat in the final is not expected to change that view. Amorim acknowledges the need for changes at the club, including improvements to the training facilities, recruitment, and academy. He emphasizes that these changes are long-term and will not be solved by winning the cup alone.</p>

          <p>Following President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, medical experts have provided insights into the diagnosis and treatment options. Doctors noted that while the diagnosis is serious, advanced treatments are available to stall the cancer's growth for years. The prognosis is considered treatable, though not curable, with standard care likely involving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to block testosterone production. Experts emphasized that modern treatments can maintain a good quality of life for many years, making prostate cancer different from other metastasized cancers.</p>

          <p>Seniors should assess their retirement savings and plans in light of recent market volatility and potential changes to Social Security. Long-term care insurance may be a strategic option if retirement funds have declined or plans have shifted, especially considering the rising costs of assisted living facilities and in-home care. Evaluating the value of securing a plan now versus delaying it is essential, as delays often lead to higher premiums and less comprehensive coverage. Carefully weighing the costs and benefits can help seniors make informed decisions about their long-term care needs.</p>

The show began with a firm idea of what was wrong with other talk shows: actors promoting projects, overly planned chat, generic topicality, formulaic structure, and critics like me have long complained about these elements, and Mulaney, bless him, just did away with them. However, figuring out the show you want to do is harder than knowing the one you don’t. The show has evolved, gotten tighter, funnier, more meta, and become a high-profile case for risk-taking artists doing funny work.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old hiker, Dennis Smith, died while attempting a rim-to-rim hike at the Grand Canyon. Smith was found unresponsive on the North Kaibab Trail, a strenuous trek covering about 24 miles. Bystanders and park service personnel attempted resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The park service has warned of extreme heat in the coming days and encourages hikers to be self-reliant and monitor inner canyon conditions, as assistance may be delayed due to limited staff and rescue calls.</p>
