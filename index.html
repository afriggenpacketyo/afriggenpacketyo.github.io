        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis has identified the ten U.S. state economies most resilient to a potential recession, considering factors like GDP growth, job creation, fiscal health, and exposure to trade wars. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina secured the top three spots, praised for their strong growth, diverse economies, and manageable dependence on international trade. The study also factored in states' reliance on federal spending amid potential budget cuts. Other states in the top ten include Delaware, New York, Washington, and Idaho, each demonstrating unique strengths that contribute to their economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, with the new policy set to take effect on August 1. The decision was communicated through letters to the leaders of both trading partners, citing persistent trade deficits and a need for more reciprocal trade relationships. The announcement also included a warning that any retaliatory tariffs from the EU or Mexico would result in further increases to the 30% rate. This move marks a significant escalation in global trade tensions under the current administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing trade disputes, businesses are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to manage the financial impact of tariffs. These designated areas allow companies to import materials and assemble products without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow and provides flexibility, as duties can be deferred or avoided entirely if products are re-exported. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, increasing costs for some manufacturers who previously paid lower duties on finished goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved multiple requests from Camp Mystic to remove dozens of its buildings from the 100-year flood map in the years preceding the recent catastrophic flood. This re-designation lessened regulatory oversight and insurance requirements for the camp, which is located in a high-risk area known as "flash flood alley." Experts have expressed concern over these exemptions, questioning why a facility responsible for children would challenge a reasonable risk assessment. The tragic flood, which claimed the lives of numerous campers and counselors, was reportedly more severe than a 100-year event.</p>

Analysts believe the campaign aims to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses faster than they can be replenished by Western aid.

          <p>Two 21-year-old men have appeared in court following a police chase that ended with a stolen BMW crashing into a care home in Sunderland, UK. Two elderly female residents of the home, one in her 80s and another in her 90s, died the day after the incident, and police are investigating if the crash contributed to their deaths. The men are charged with robbery and kidnapping, as the car's owner was in the vehicle for a test drive when it was stolen. One of the accused also faces a charge of causing serious injury to another resident.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly reforms the federal student loan system, streamlining the current seven repayment plans down to two and imposing new caps on borrowing amounts. Beginning in 2026, new borrowers will choose between a standard 10-25 year plan or an income-driven plan. The law also eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new graduate students and restricts Parent PLUS loans. Additionally, it tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and eliminates economic hardship deferments, changes that advocates worry could force borrowers to stay in repayment for longer periods.

          <p>A political opinion column suggests that Eric and Lara Trump are positioning themselves to fill the political void left by Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. The article points to Eric Trump's recent hint at a future presidential run and Lara Trump's own political ambitions, including her former role as co-chair of the RNC and a potential 2026 Senate bid in North Carolina. The author argues that Lara Trump has taken on the role of softening Donald Trump's image, much like Ivanka did previously.

          <p>According to a negotiation expert, asking for a raise is not a single conversation but a process that can take several weeks. To be successful, employees should initiate the discussion well before annual reviews, such as during a mid-year check-in, to influence future budgets. The initial meeting should aim to start the dialogue, not to secure a final agreement. The expert advises patience and strategic follow-up, including solidifying a time for a second meeting and documenting the conversation. This collaborative and persistent approach is more likely to yield the desired compensation changes.</p>

Residents and environmental groups report that the Kok and Sai rivers have become contaminated with unsafe levels of arsenic and other hazardous metals, leading to skin rashes and making the water unusable for bathing or irrigation. This mining, driven by global demand for components in electronics and vehicles, is largely controlled by an armed ethnic militia.
