          <p>A new study reveals that Shanghai is rapidly subsiding while global sea levels are rising at an accelerated rate, creating a significant threat for the coastal metropolis. Researchers attribute 94% of this urban subsidence to human activities, as cities like Shanghai were built on soft sediment in delta regions. This combination of sinking land and rising waters poses a severe long-term risk to the city's infrastructure and population, highlighting the urgent challenges of climate change and urban development.</p>

          <p>The Peruvian government has announced a state of emergency for the capital city, Lima, after anti-government demonstrations turned violent, resulting in one death and over one hundred injuries. The protests, led mainly by young people, are a response to widespread discontent over low wages, corruption, and crime. Despite calls for his resignation, interim President Jose Jeri has refused to step down, vowing to restore stability and blaming "delinquents" for infiltrating peaceful marches.</p>

The judge concluded that Mr. Rahman likely used a tool like ChatGPT, attempted to conceal this fact, and consequently wasted the tribunal's time with misleading and baseless submissions.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has labeled the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a match against Aston Villa in Birmingham as "wrong." This sentiment was echoed by other prominent political figures who criticized the move, arguing it sends a shameful message and fails to combat antisemitism. The ban was recommended by a local safety advisory group and supported by West Midlands Police, citing "high-risk" intelligence and concerns over potential protests related to the Middle East conflict.</p>

          <p>China has tightened its control over the global supply of critical minerals by imposing new, sweeping restrictions on the export of rare earths. These minerals are essential for manufacturing a wide range of products, from smartphones to advanced military hardware like F-35 fighter jets. This move is seen as a strategic power play, reminding the U.S. of its supply chain vulnerabilities and giving Beijing a significant advantage ahead of potential trade negotiations between the two economic superpowers.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injectable drug for HIV prevention, cabotegravir, will now be available through the NHS in England and Wales, aligning policy with Scotland. The injection, administered every two months, offers an alternative to daily pills and is hoped to help end new HIV cases by 2030. This method is considered particularly beneficial for individuals who find it difficult to adhere to a daily oral PrEP regimen, offering a more convenient and discreet option for protection against the virus.</p>
