            <p>A report by MPs has revealed that some police forces were unprepared for the level of violence that erupted during riots following the murder of three children in Southport last summer.

            <p>According to Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese studies, China may be surprised by the Trump administration's lack of caution and understanding of Chinese negotiation tactics. Brown suggests that threatening and presenting China with zero-sum options is counterproductive, given China's strong narrative of resisting victimization and bullying. He believes Trump's approach is likely to strengthen China's resolve to stand its ground. Brown's analysis provides insight into the potential miscalculations in the U.S. approach to trade relations with China.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the U.S. to completely cancel reciprocal tariffs, as trade tensions between the two countries continue. This follows Trump's announcement of a 90-day pause on global tariffs but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. The U.S. administration's suggestion of future levies may dampen hopes for a thaw in trade relations. The situation remains uncertain as both sides evaluate the impact of these measures.
