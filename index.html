          <h2>Gerry Adams Claims BBC Response to Complaint Was Insulting During Libel Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams stated that the BBC's response to his complaint regarding a Spotlight program about the murder of Denis Donaldson was insulting and arrogant. Adams is suing the BBC for damages at the High Court in Dublin, alleging the program falsely implicated him in Donaldson's murder in 2006, which he denies. Adams' lawyers read out correspondence seeking an apology and compensation, accusing the BBC of malice and sensationalism, but the BBC rejected these remedies, asserting responsible journalism and adherence to editorial guidelines. Adams claimed the BBC doubled down on the allegations and dismissed efforts to resolve the issue, leading to the ongoing legal battle.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals how consulting firms owned by private equity firms use algorithms to influence college pricing and financial aid decisions. These firms collect extensive data on prospective students and their families to offer colleges targeted marketing and "financial aid optimization" strategies. This approach, pioneered decades ago, allows colleges to offer precision-guided discounts based on applicant quality rather than solely on financial need. The firms gather data on student interactions to advise schools on setting individual prices, leading to concerns about algorithmic collusion and inequities in financial aid distribution.</p>

          <p>Executives at Dominion Energy stated that the demand for data centers is not slowing down in Northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Dominion provides electricity to Loudoun County, known as "Data Center Alley," and works closely with Big Tech companies investing heavily in data centers for AI model training. Despite concerns about potential pullbacks due to tariffs or economic uncertainty, Dominion reports continued appetite for additional data center capacity and no signs of spending pauses from its customers.

          <p>Eli Lilly reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by strong sales of its GLP-1 medications, Mounjaro and Zepbound. However, the stock price tumbled due to a new partnership between CVS Health and Novo Nordisk, which gives Wegovy preferential treatment, potentially impacting Lilly's market share. Despite this, Lilly's CEO emphasized the company's focus on innovation, such as its oral GLP-1 medication, and reiterated the full-year sales outlook. Analysts believe the CVS Health change could temporarily affect Eli Lilly shares, but the long-term thesis remains unchanged. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Guardian's editorial views the US-Ukraine mineral deal with measured skepticism, noting its limited significance despite the Trump administration's enthusiastic portrayal. While the agreement, which originated with Kyiv's desire to incentivize US interest in its defense, is a diplomatic success, it falls short of providing a security guarantee. The presence of American businesses in Ukraine does not inherently offer protection, and the deal does not signal a shift in Trump's relationship with Putin. The editorial suggests the agreement may encourage Trump to feel politically invested in the crisis, potentially leading Putin to act more cautiously.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $1 billion in funding for children's mental health services, citing concerns that the programs funded by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act were no longer in the best interest of the federal government. The Education Department stated that grant recipients were using the funding to implement race-based actions, such as recruiting quotas, which could hurt the students the grants were supposed to help. Critics argue that this move jeopardizes crucial mental health support for students and equates mental health services with radicalization.</p>

          <p>Publishers Clearing House (PCH) is set to refund nearly 282,000 customers, totaling over $18 million, due to misleading emails. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleged that PCH used "dark patterns" to deceive customers into thinking they needed to make a purchase to enter sweepstakes or improve their odds of winning. The FTC also said PCH sent deceptive emails suggesting they were related to official government documents. Only PCH customers who clicked on one of the allegedly misleading emails and ordered a product are eligible for a refund.</p>
