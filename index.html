          <p>The FBI analyzed phone records of nine Republican lawmakers in 2023 as part of its investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, according to information released by GOP senators. This data, encompassing several days during the week of January 6, 2021, revealed basic call times and dates but not communication content. The disclosure adds new details to the since-shuttered probe, which was abandoned after Mr. Trump's 2024 election win due to a Justice Department legal opinion. Senators like Chuck Grassley condemned the action as a violation of personal and constitutional rights, while Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed grave concerns about this perceived abuse of power and weaponization of government, calling for a thorough review.</p>

          <h2>New Research Challenges Long-Held Theory of Shackleton's Endurance Sinking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher from Aalto University, Jukka Tuhkuri, has proposed a new theory for the sinking of Sir Ernest Shackleton's legendary ship, Endurance, in 1915, challenging the long-held belief that immense ice pressure was the sole culprit. Tuhkuri's study suggests the ship's inherent structural weaknesses were a primary factor in its demise. The vessel, built for less severe Arctic conditions, reportedly lacked sufficient cross-beams and diagonal bracing in its engine room, making it vulnerable to crushing forces. This new analysis, which consulted expedition diaries and structural data, offers a fresh perspective on one of history's most famous shipwrecks, whose remarkably preserved remains were found in 2022, two years prior to this article's publication.</p>

          <p>Bill Nye and hundreds of space advocates protested proposed Trump administration budget cuts to NASA, warning that a 25% reduction for fiscal year 2026 could jeopardize U.S. leadership in space exploration. Nye emphasized that NASA's budget is a minuscule fraction of federal spending, yet yields extraordinary returns, including technological advancements and the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life. He cautioned that such cuts would allow nations like China, which plans its own Mars sample-return mission in 2028, to surpass the U.S. in scientific endeavors. Investing in NASA, Nye stated, offers a priceless return and significant economic benefits, with every dollar generating three dollars back into the economy.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla is intensifying over the Pacific Ocean off southwest Mexico and is forecast to become a Category 2 hurricane, potentially approaching major hurricane status within the next couple of days. The Mexican government has issued tropical storm watches for parts of Baja California Sur and the west-central coast, from Cabo San Lucas to Punta Mita. Although expected to remain several hundred miles offshore, Priscilla is predicted to bring heavy rains of 2-4 inches, with up to 6 inches in some spots, gusty winds, and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions to coastal areas. Forecasters anticipate the storm will likely start weakening by midweek after its peak intensity.</p>

          <p>The head of Citic, Li, stated in an exclusive interview that Hong Kong should strategically broaden its financial connector role to encompass the entire Asia-Pacific region, not solely mainland China. He envisions the city as Asia's premier financing hub, attracting listings and raising capital for top-tier companies across India, Southeast Asia, Japan, and Singapore. Li highlighted Hong Kong's deep fundraising pool, high degree of capital freedom, and unique "one country, two systems" framework as crucial advantages for connecting Asian companies with global markets. This perspective emerges as mainland capital continues to flow into the city amidst ongoing US-China decoupling, reinforcing its pivotal position. (not investment advice)</p>

This review by all 17 active judges of the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sets aside the previous ruling, which had been a victory for opponents.

Developing countries, particularly China, led this clean energy expansion, adding more capacity than the rest of the world combined, while some developed nations increased reliance on fossil fuels.

          <p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) has instructed its members to continue working during the U.S. government shutdown, warning that participating in job actions could lead to removal from federal service. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed a slight increase in sick calls among air traffic controllers, acknowledging the negative impact on morale of working unpaid. Controllers are deemed essential workers and are guaranteed back pay once funding is restored, but the situation creates significant uncertainty and hardship. This issue compounds an existing nationwide shortage of controllers, which has already contributed to airport delays and highlights vulnerabilities in the aviation system.</p>

          <p>John Reid, a gay Republican candidate for Virginia lieutenant governor, confirmed that his running mate, gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, is "100 percent against" marriage equality, citing her Jamaican upbringing and religious beliefs. This admission follows Reid's recent link to a Nazi-themed pornography blog on a social media account he allegedly operated, intensifying scrutiny of his campaign. Earle-Sears has a long history of anti-LGBTQ+ stances, including describing homosexuality as an "immoral lifestyle choice" and opposing measures to enshrine marriage equality in the state constitution. The article highlights the striking contradictions and deep political and social conflict within the Republican ticket.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to increase parking meter rates by 50 cents per hour across its 35,000 paid spaces and extend paid parking hours, including Sundays and until midnight in nightlife areas. These changes, approved by the City Council, are expected to take effect by the end of October, with prices currently ranging from $1 to $8.50 per hour. City transportation officials state the measures aim to encourage vehicle turnover, benefiting businesses, and are projected to generate $14.4 million for the city. This comes as Los Angeles faces a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall, with other nearby cities also recently raising parking rates to address financial challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, his own appointee, after she temporarily blocked his administration's deployment of federalized troops to Oregon, calling her ruling shameful. This incident highlights ongoing tensions between the president and the judiciary, particularly the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is handling multiple challenges to his use of the National Guard in cities. Governor Gavin Newsom also rebuked the National Governors Association for its silence on the issue, accusing the Trump administration of infringing on state sovereignty. Experts note that judges, even conservative ones, are pushing back when presidential actions appear "untethered to the facts" and lack legal basis.</p>

While he once considered a Premier League return a certainty, his perspective has shifted after a couple of successful years in Bavaria.

Prosecutors noted his lack of criminal history and distinguished public service spanning three decades, agreeing to a probation sentence.

This rhetoric accompanies Trump's unprecedented use of federal power, including military deployments, and his threats to invoke the Insurrection Act.

This announcement follows a public dispute between the council and the Labour government over updated guidance, with Labour having previously moved to give the Justice Secretary veto powers.

By relinquishing this status, Beijing removes a key talking point for the U.S. and European Union, who criticized a hi-tech export powerhouse claiming benefits meant for far poorer states. This maneuver is seen as a tactical move to reframe the global trade battlefield in terms that favor China's long-term position. (not investment advice)</p>

Many international students who typically leave the U.S. over school breaks have also opted to remain in the country this year, due to fears that they wouldn’t be allowed back in even with a valid visa.
