          <p>Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years, signaling a desire for policy stability. The S&P/ASX 200 index edged down by 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar slightly depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Trading volumes were thin, with Japanese, South Korean, Hong Kong, and Chinese markets closed for public holidays. U.S. futures also saw a slight decline, contrasting with the strong performance in Wall Street last week, where the S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced movies entering the United States, citing the decline of the American motion picture industry due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump stated that this situation poses a national security threat, as it involves messaging and propaganda. He has authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin implementing the tariff immediately. This announcement follows pauses in several of Trump's other tariff plans due to market turmoil and backlash.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the former prison on an island near San Francisco, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump stated that this action would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice. The Bureau of Prisons has indicated it will comply with all Presidential Orders, though the practicality of reopening Alcatraz, now a National Park Service site, remains uncertain. Alcatraz, which operated as a maximum-security prison from 1934 to 1963, housed infamous criminals like Al Capone and Machine-Gun Kelly.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the impact of President Trump's policies and persona on recent elections in Canada, Australia, Germany, Britain and Singapore. In Canada and Australia, center-left parties won by campaigning against Trump-like conservatives, while in Singapore, stability amid Trump's trade wars boosted the incumbent party. In Germany, Trump's policies indirectly helped the new chancellor push through spending limit suspensions. However, in Britain, a Trump-aligned party gained ground, indicating the unpredictable nature of Trump's influence on global politics. The article suggests that while anti-Trump sentiment may be a factor in some elections, the impact varies across different political landscapes.</p>

Nine major firms made a deal with the White House, agreeing to give nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by the firms and Trump. Critics argue that these actions are an attack on the legal profession and the rule of law, potentially intimidating lawyers from taking cases against the president.

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 4% after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month. The decision by the eight producers, led by Saudi Arabia, involves increasing output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. This follows a similar increase in May, resulting in over 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market over two months. Concerns about oversupply and potential recession due to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs have contributed to the price drop, with oil prices posting their biggest monthly loss since 2021.</p>

He also highlights a growing pressure in Washington for policy specialists to adopt an anti-China stance.
