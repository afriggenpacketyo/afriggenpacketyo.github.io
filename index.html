          <p>A jury in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela, with arsenic-laced protein shakes in 2023. Prosecutors presented evidence of Craig's incriminating internet searches, such as how to make a murder look like a heart attack. He was also found guilty on several other charges, including soliciting a fellow inmate to murder an investigator on his case. The first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

California cities occupy the top five spots on the list, a trend attributed to the state's highly productive economy and desirable lifestyle. Strong demand, limited housing supply, and geographic constraints are cited as the primary drivers of the high prices.

Violante was shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, who died from her injuries, leaving him permanently blinded. Denaro was shot months earlier but survived with a metal plate in his head, derailing his military career. Both men reflect on how the attacks irrevocably changed their lives and express relief that Berkowitz was captured and remains imprisoned.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that no decision has been made for the September meeting, citing concerns over the inflationary impact of tariffs.

The 1991 crime, which involved the victims being bound, shot, and left in a building set on fire, has remained unsolved. Although two men were previously convicted and later had their convictions overturned, a key piece of evidence—a male DNA profile found on one victim that didn't match the suspects—has been the focus.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates paused, borrowers facing high-cost debt are encouraged to explore alternative relief strategies. The article suggests three key moves: conducting a detailed budget review to identify savings, understanding the risks of various debt relief options like credit counseling or debt management, and addressing the root behaviors that led to debt accumulation. While a rate cut would have offered broad relief, these proactive steps can help individuals regain control of their finances in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. The powerful temblor, one of the strongest ever recorded, prompted evacuation orders and warnings in Hawaii, Japan, and along the U.S. West Coast. In Russia, waves as high as 16 feet caused flooding, though no major damage or severe injuries were immediately reported. Authorities in Hawaii and other regions urged residents to move to higher ground as the series of waves began to arrive.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is overseeing the investigation into former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration accuses de Moraes of human rights violations, censorship, and conducting a politically motivated "witch hunt" against Bolsonaro and other political opponents. The sanctions coincide with President Trump imposing 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, citing the Brazilian government's actions as undermining democratic values. De Moraes has been a central figure in legal challenges against Bolsonaro and his allies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order placing a universal 50% tariff on all copper imports, effective immediately, causing U.S. copper prices to plummet in after-hours trading. This move follows similar steep tariffs on steel and aluminum and is part of the administration's strategy to bolster domestic industries and correct trade imbalances. Experts warn the tariff could increase costs for a wide range of consumer products, from electronics to construction materials. The U.S. imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, making the economic impact potentially significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of life sciences company Danaher have rallied following a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report, but analysts remain cautious about the stock's long-term prospects. The company has faced headwinds from a slow recovery in China, tariff impacts, and reduced biotech spending. While Danaher raised its full-year earnings guidance, it did not increase its revenue growth outlook, citing ongoing uncertainty. An RBC analyst suggests a sustained rally for the sector is unlikely until it returns to mid-single-digit revenue growth, which may still be a few quarters away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents in states including California, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas can expect an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' mating season begins. During September and October, thousands of mature male tarantulas, which can be the size of a baseball, emerge from their burrows to search for females. Although their appearance and reputation are intimidating, the spiders are generally timid and will not bite unless provoked. The males typically die within a year of mating, while females can live for over two decades.</p>

Speaking at the White House, he provided no specific details about a potential agreement but maintained a positive tone about the ongoing discussions. This update comes as recent data showed a significant 24% year-on-year decline in China's exports to the U.S. for the second quarter of 2025. Negotiators from both countries have described their recent talks as "constructive" but have offered different timelines for a potential pause in tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for an end to the Senate's "blue slip" tradition, which allows home-state senators to effectively veto certain presidential nominees, such as federal judges and U.S. attorneys. His call comes after his former lawyer, Alina Habba, was blocked from a permanent U.S. Attorney post in New Jersey by the state's two Democratic senators. The article explains that this tradition has been used by both parties to block nominees, but Trump's push to end it could allow him to install loyalist prosecutors and judges in blue states without the consent of their senators.</p>
