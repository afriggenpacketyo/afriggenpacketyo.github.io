          <p>A dog named Petunia has won the 2025 "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California, securing a $5,000 prize for her owner. The event, which has run for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique canine beauty and advocates for animal adoption. Many of the contestants, including Petunia, are rescue dogs from shelters or puppy mills. Organizers describe the contest as a testament to the idea that a pet's value is not defined by its pedigree.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is meeting with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to advance a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. The framework reportedly includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a complete Israeli military withdrawal from the territory. This diplomatic effort comes as Israel's plan for a military takeover of Gaza City faces widespread international condemnation from numerous countries. Meanwhile, families of the hostages are pressuring the Israeli government to prioritize their return, fearing the planned offensive will endanger them further.</p>

He firmly rejected any peace deal that involves surrendering Ukrainian land, emphasizing that the nation's territorial integrity is non-negotiable. The planned bilateral meeting in Alaska has raised concerns in Kyiv and European capitals about being marginalized. In response, several European leaders issued a joint statement underscoring that Ukraine's destiny cannot be decided without its participation.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has expressed regret over a controversial sandal design created in collaboration with Adidas, which the Mexican government claims appropriates an Indigenous Oaxacan style. The "Oaxaca Slip-On" drew complaints for reinterpreting the traditional huarache sandal without partnering with the local community. Mexico's government is seeking compensation, with President Claudia Sheinbaum calling it an issue of collective intellectual property. Adidas has stated it values Mexico's cultural wealth and has requested a meeting with local officials to discuss repairing the damage.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance held high-stakes diplomatic talks in the United Kingdom with Ukrainian officials and European allies regarding the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which reportedly produced significant progress, occurred just before President Trump's planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The talks aimed to address European and Ukrainian concerns that a bilateral U.S.-Russia meeting could sideline their interests. Ukrainian officials reiterated that a lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table and with full respect for its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain since July 2020, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. This surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Donald Trump, where Apple announced plans to spend $100 billion on American parts and companies. President Trump indicated that Apple's commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt it from future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about potential impacts on profitability. The positive market reaction reflects renewed confidence after the company had previously warned of significant tariff-related costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of approximately 20 Arab and Muslim countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, has strongly condemned Israel's plan to launch a new military offensive and take control of Gaza City. In a joint statement, the nations described the plan as a "dangerous and unacceptable escalation" and a "flagrant violation of international law." The proposal, approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Security Cabinet, has been widely denounced internationally and has reportedly faced warnings from Israel's own army chief about its potential consequences.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in Southern California, named the Canyon Fire, has burned nearly 5,400 acres and prompted evacuation orders for thousands of residents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The blaze, fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, spread rapidly after igniting on Thursday. A firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over a ridge while battling the flames. While favorable overnight weather allowed crews to achieve 28% containment, officials are urging residents to remain on high alert as high temperatures are forecast to continue.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's efforts to position himself as a global peacemaker, contrasting his diplomatic successes with the formidable challenges posed by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. While Trump has overseen several ceasefires and peace agreements in other regions, breakthroughs in these two major conflicts have remained elusive. His approach to the Ukraine war is now focused on a high-stakes, one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin, which has drawn concern from allies. In Gaza, his administration's support for Israel is being tested by the severe humanitarian crisis and stalled hostage negotiations.</p>

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad is returning to his leadership role at the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research just over a week after his departure. Prasad, an oncologist and vocal critic of past COVID-19 policies, had left the agency following pressure and criticism, notably from far-right influencer Laura Loomer. His initial short tenure was marked by controversy, including the agency's handling of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that Prasad was resuming his position at the FDA's request.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old man from Glenwood, Iowa, has died from injuries sustained after he shot and killed two of his neighbors and then set his own house on fire.

          <p>This article examines the changing depiction of Kashmir in India's Bollywood film industry over the decades. Initially portrayed as a scenic, romantic paradise in the post-independence era, the region's cinematic image shifted dramatically with the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. Films began to reflect the conflict, often framing Kashmir as a battleground for Indian patriotism against Pakistan-backed insurgents. More recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are described as increasingly aligning with the Indian government's political narratives, reflecting the current "statist" perspective of the industry.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has denied any conspiracy to destroy her predecessor and mentor, the late Alex Salmond. She accuses Salmond of failing to show contrition for his inappropriate behavior towards women and of being willing to destroy the Scottish National Party for personal reasons. Sturgeon recounts her shock upon learning of the allegations against him and her refusal to intervene in the government's investigation. She characterizes Salmond's claims of a conspiracy as a fabrication designed to deflect from his own conduct.</p>

The incident occurred in Thailand's Sisaket province, with one soldier suffering a severe leg injury. The Thai army claims this demonstrates a violation of the Ottawa Convention by Cambodia, suggesting new mines are being laid. Cambodian authorities have denied this, stating they are committed to removing, not deploying, landmines left from past conflicts in the historically contested border region.</p>
