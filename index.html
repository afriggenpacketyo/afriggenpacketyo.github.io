          <p>A Russian drone strike on a passenger bus in north-eastern Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of nine people and injuries to four others, according to local officials. The incident occurred in the town of Bilopillia, with medics, emergency services, and police responding to the scene. This attack occurred shortly after Russia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, though no breakthroughs were achieved. The Sumy regional head described the attack as "inhumane," stating that a Russian Lancet drone hit the bus at 06:17 local time on Saturday, while the Russian military has not yet commented on the situation.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service regarding an Instagram post that President Trump's supporters interpreted as a veiled threat. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some interpreted as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, while Trump and top administration officials rejected Comey's explanation, with Trump labeling Comey a "dirty cop" calling for the "assassination of the president." The Secret Service investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns under the Alien Enemies Act. Meanwhile, a New Jersey Transit strike has disrupted commutes, marking the first statewide transit strike in over 40 years after contract negotiations broke down. The House Budget Committee blocked the Republican's major domestic policy bill due to conservative hard-liners demanding deeper budget cuts. Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war after peace talks in Istanbul, though a ceasefire agreement remains elusive.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity after Special Counsel Robert Hur's report raised questions about his memory. Audio recordings from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to remember key details, such as when his son Beau died and when he left office as vice president. In response to the report, Biden asserted that he knew what he was doing and didn't need Hur's recommendation. The Hur report and Biden's performance in a June presidential debate led to calls for him to drop out of the race, which he did in July.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, blanketing the city and surrounding areas with dust and reducing visibility to zero in some locations. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time ever for the Chicago office and the first time including the city itself. The storm was caused by 60 to 70 mph winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air. The dust storm caused ground stops at Midway International Airport and significant expressway backups, but skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes.</p>

Prosecutors aim to prove Combs was not just an abuser but a mastermind of a criminal enterprise. Ventura detailed instances of violence and coercion, including forced participation in "freak-offs" and a 2016 hotel incident caught on video, emphasizing the lack of consent and the control Combs exerted over her life.</p>

The trip contrasted sharply with the backlash Trump faces at home over tariff policies and immigration, with gulf leaders praising his approach and echoing his slogans.

          <p>Ammunition companies in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear they may not survive tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods sent to the United States, their largest market. These companies, which survived the Balkan wars, now face economic uncertainty as tariffs disrupt exports. The tariffs have stalled expansion plans and risk scaring off American customers, threatening the livelihood of over 2,000 local residents. The US, with its high demand for guns, had been a lifeline for Gorazde's ammunition makers after the collapse of Yugoslavia, but the new tariffs and dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. projects have cast a shadow over the town's future.</p>

          <p>Following the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult's nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subway in 1995, dozens of abused and malnourished children were rescued from its compound. These children, separated from their parents and ruthlessly indoctrinated, were initially hostile and demanded to return to the cult, but a child welfare center provided a safe space for them to recover. The children gradually began to trust and play together, and reunions with parents who had left the cult helped break Asahara's grip. After three months, all 53 children were transferred to national child guidance centers, marking the end of their relationship with the center's staff.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from a 2023 interview with Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur, who described former President Joe Biden as an "elderly man with a poor memory," have been released.

While a written transcript of the interview was previously released, the audio provides additional context on Biden's demeanor and memory issues. The release has reignited concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, which contributed to his decision to withdraw from the presidential race.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, are causing concern among those who rely on it. An analysis estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. Some Americans worry that the cuts could reduce their ability to receive health care or force them to choose between paying for coverage and necessities. The proposed bill would also impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, raising concerns about access to care for those with disabilities or substance use disorders.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times opinion piece criticizes the Democratic Party for its groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion in failing to acknowledge Joe Biden's infirmity. The author argues that Democrats, particularly those in Washington, were too close to the White House and engaged with policy to recognize how weak Biden appeared to the public. The piece suggests that the party needs to acknowledge their mistakes and move forward with more courage and less deference to established norms. The failure to address concerns about Biden's health led to a disastrous situation, requiring a reckoning and a more honest assessment of the party's missteps.</p>
