          <p>Two employees of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum, an incident being investigated as a potential hate crime and act of terrorism. Elias Rodriguez, the suspect, was apprehended shortly after and charged with first-degree murder, reportedly stating the attack was "for Palestine." The FBI is examining Rodriguez's online activity, including pro-Palestinian writings, while officials investigate the legally purchased weapon's origins in Illinois and his travel from Chicago. Lischinsky and Milgrim were scheduled to travel to Jerusalem, and Lischinsky planned to propose to Milgrim, according to the Israeli ambassador.

          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. He emphasized that the deal involves investment and partial ownership but ensures U.S. control, referencing a potential partnership that could create 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the economy. Trump's approval follows a review by federal agencies, though details of the acquisition scheme remain undisclosed. Both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have welcomed the president's decision, but Trump has not revealed any details of the potential acquisition scheme. </p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a rise from previous years, attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improved detection systems. The company defines a fake review as biased or non-firsthand content intended to manipulate a property's reputation. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews, with boosting and member fraud accounting for the majority of these submissions. The article highlights the ongoing "cat and mouse" game between Tripadvisor and those attempting to post fake reviews, as the company continues to refine its detection methods.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner in China, suggests that China should lower its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years, taking into account potential challenges such as a protracted rivalry with the United States and domestic structural problems. Xu emphasized that maintaining employment and controlling debt are crucial, and setting a higher growth target than the potential growth rate would be inappropriate. He highlighted China's shrinking population, falling savings, and weak market confidence as reasons for the suggested adjustment. China did not set a quantitative growth target in its 2021-2025 development plan but has been estimated to aim for at least 4.8% annual expansion until 2035.</p>

Dr. Najjar's husband was critically injured, and another child was in moderate condition, according to Gaza health officials. The Israeli military stated that they struck suspects near Israeli forces but were checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." The family had remained in their home despite evacuation orders, feeling they could not move their ten children into a crowded camp without services, but critics say the war appears set to drag on with no clear end in sight.</p>

The incident, described by Kim Jong Un as a "criminal act," involved a 5,000-ton destroyer that tipped over and damaged its hull. Three other officials at the Chongjin shipyard were also detained in connection with the launch failure, which Kim attributed to "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism."

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, suggests that Beijing could subdue Taiwan by targeting 30 to 40 "super critical" infrastructure targets, causing a system-wide collapse. The article details how attacks on key facilities, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, could disrupt electricity, water supplies, and communications, creating favorable conditions for a "win without fighting." It argues that this tactic of "urban collapse warfare" would minimize military costs while maximizing impact, aligning with Sun Tzu's principle of defeating the enemy without direct combat. Taiwan's dependence on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters make it a prime target for this strategy, according to the article.</p>

Apple is reportedly accelerating plans to shift iPhone production to India by the end of 2026 to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Americans across the country commemorated the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, with gatherings in Houston, where he grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was killed. Floyd's murder sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality, but some observers note a fading of the national "reckoning" with racism as President Trump rolls back police reforms. Events included memorial services, poetry sessions, and speeches by civil rights leaders, with calls for continued changes and federal police reform agreements. The anniversary served as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for racial justice and police accountability.</p>
