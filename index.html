          <p>Jake Wood, the executive director of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, resigned just before the launch of a new Israeli-backed aid program in Gaza, citing an inability to maintain neutrality and independence. Wood's departure followed reports questioning the foundation's autonomy and its connections with Israel, including its inception by Israeli officials and the hiring of private contractors. The foundation aims to distribute food from four sites in southern Gaza under Israeli military control, with supporters claiming it will prevent Hamas from stealing aid.

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicolás Maduro, claimed his party won regional and legislative elections, despite the absence of independent monitors and calls for abstention by opposition leader María Corina Machado. The results, announced on state television, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governor's seat of Zulia. Critics, including political scientist Benigno Alarcón, deemed the vote undemocratic, citing low turnout and a lack of transparency. The announcement follows a contested presidential election last year, where Maduro also claimed victory despite evidence of losing to Edmundo González.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price cuts on several electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, have raised concerns among investors about increased competition and a potential price war in the sector. Despite the stock decline, analysts from Citi anticipate a surge in foot traffic at BYD's dealership stores and expect robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies priced below 200,000 Chinese yuan.

          <p>Energy firm Octopus has apologized to Peter Holden of Hartlebury, Worcestershire, for relentlessly pursuing him for almost four years over another person's gas bill. Despite Holden repeatedly alerting the firm to the error, he received monthly bills and was chased by debt collectors for a debt exceeding £6,000. The firm admitted the error was due to a shared meter serial number in industry data. Octopus' commercial director personally apologized and promised further staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future.</p>

Ophuls also directed "Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," which won an Academy Award. His work challenged historical narratives and explored complex moral issues.</p>

          <p>Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president, has proposed creating a large "buffer zone" in Ukraine to protect Russian towns from Western weapons. This zone would encompass almost all of Ukraine, excluding a small area along the Polish border. Analysts estimate that at Russia's current rate of advance, achieving this goal would take approximately 91 years. The Institute for the Study of War also suggests that such an endeavor would cost Russia a significant portion of its population, considering the estimated casualties per day.</p>

Analysts expect the YU7, priced between 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), to significantly erode Tesla's market share in China.

By bypassing the auction system and engaging directly with major retailers, the government intends to exert greater influence over prices.
