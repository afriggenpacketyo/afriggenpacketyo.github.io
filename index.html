          <p>This article details the case of Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, who is accused of the depraved-heart murder of his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, following her overdose. Sarah's mother, Tina Harris, immediately suspected Ryan, leading Sarah's sister, Rachel Harris, to find incriminating texts between Sarah and Ryan, revealing his provision of dangerous drugs. Detective Ian Iacoviello, an expert in pharmaceutical investigations, built a case based on these texts and Rachel's photos, leading to Ryan's arrest. The defense argued that Sarah was struggling with mental illness and may have administered the drugs herself, but Ryan was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p>

Wood hosts "cuddle puddles" and offers one-to-one cuddle therapy, emphasizing the platonic and nurturing nature of her services. While some experts caution that the relationship between people involved is important for touch to be beneficial, Wood stresses the importance of consent and boundaries in her practice.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks, sparking outrage and protests. A federal judge ordered her release on bail, citing potential violations of her due process and First Amendment rights, particularly regarding an op-ed she co-authored on Israel's war with Hamas. At a news conference, Ozturk thanked her community for their support, while Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed her home and vowed to continue fighting for her exoneration.

          <p>This article discusses how Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amid sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transaction volume, attributed to efforts to defend market share. However, analysts note the importance of monitoring expansion beyond wealthier cities, and a large number of coffee shops have opened in second-tier cities. These trends suggest a shift in the coffee market towards broader accessibility and affordability in China.</p>

This event is unusual because atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western U.S., but it may help alleviate recent droughts in certain areas of Florida.

The economies of towns like Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario, are linked, and they previously faced economic hardship during the Covid-19 pandemic. Canadians are increasingly choosing to "Buy Canadian" and reducing travel to the US, and some Canadian duty-free shops have seen up to an 80% decrease in sales.

Baraka was arrested while protesting the facility's opening and is now charged with trespassing, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hinted at more arrests. Newark has sued Geo Group, the company running the facility, citing permit issues and denied inspections. Baraka insists he did nothing wrong and emphasizes the lack of transparency surrounding the facility.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for direct talks with Ukraine, proposing a meeting in Istanbul on May 15 to seek a lasting peace and address the root causes of the conflict. This comes after European leaders visited Ukraine and urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin stated he would not rule out new ceasefires during the talks and will discuss the details with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Kyiv has yet to comment on Putin's proposal.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen and Tufts University student, arrived in Boston after a federal judge ordered her release from a detention facility in Louisiana. She was detained for six weeks after writing an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands.

          <p>India and Pakistan declared a cease-fire after four days of escalating conflict, mediated by the United States, although only Pakistan quickly acknowledged an American role. However, reports of cross-border firing continued, and each country accused the other of violating the deal, which was triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir. The conflict involved missile strikes, drone attacks, and intense shelling, leading to civilian casualties and displacement. While President Trump announced the truce, it remained uncertain whether the cease-fire would hold in Kashmir.</p>

While the airport acknowledges a small leak, it denies any link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook.

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland to discuss tariffs, and President Trump claimed "great progress" was made, negotiating a "total reset." While there was no immediate confirmation of progress, the talks, which could help stabilize world markets, will resume Sunday. Previous to the meeting, initial discussions were likely about de-escalation, as high tariffs are unsustainable, and officials pushed the Trump administration to drop unilateral tariffs. The U.S. has imposed tariffs totaling 145% on Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with a 125% levy.</p>

The export controls affect seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, potentially impacting the production of jet engines, radar, avionics, and other electronic systems used in military applications.
