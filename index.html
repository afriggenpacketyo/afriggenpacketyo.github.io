        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The D.C. city council has reached an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders football team, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former name. Council chairman Phil Mendelson expressed confidence that the proposal will pass, framing the president's comments as a distraction. The deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, aims to bring the team back to the RFK Stadium site. While the plan still faces challenges, including a final council vote and the transfer of federal land, it has garnered widespread local support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Postal Service operates a unique Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, dedicated to deciphering poorly handwritten addresses on mail. When automated systems fail to read an address, an image is sent to this facility, where hundreds of expert 'keyers' work around the clock to determine the correct destination. This center processes images for approximately one billion pieces of mail annually, ensuring that even letters with the most challenging penmanship have a chance to reach their intended recipient. The process is a crucial, human-powered step in the nation's complex mail delivery system.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper are both planning to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. Whatley is expected to announce his campaign soon, having received President Trump's endorsement and the blessing of the White House. This development follows Lara Trump's decision not to run for the seat. Cooper is also expected to declare his candidacy next week, setting the stage for a major political battle in one of the key 2026 midterm contests.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against New York City, arguing that its 'sanctuary city' policies illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The suit claims these policies, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities, have resulted in the release of dangerous criminals. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the legal action is necessary to protect citizens, as the administration intensifies its crackdown on undocumented immigrants. This move is part of a broader federal effort to challenge sanctuary policies in various cities and states across the country.</p>

          <p>Following his death at 71, this article reflects on Hulk Hogan's significant and complex legacy in shaping modern popular culture. Terry Bollea, as Hogan, transformed professional wrestling into a global phenomenon in the 1980s by pioneering a new brand of celebrity built on patriotism and bravado. His career set a template for reality television stardom, brand management, and navigating public scandals, from steroid use to a racism controversy that led to his temporary cancellation. The piece argues that Hogan's influence, both positive and negative, is deeply embedded in today's celebrity and political landscapes, making him a pivotal figure of his era.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's tribute to the late wrestler Hulk Hogan was interrupted by a heckler shouting profanities about the governor's immigration policies.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order establishing new federal rules for name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing in college sports. The order aims to create guardrails for what the White House terms an "out-of-control" system by banning third-party, pay-for-play payments while still allowing brand endorsements. It also mandates that universities with high athletic revenues must maintain or increase scholarships for non-revenue and women's sports. The move seeks to bring federal oversight to the rapidly commercializing landscape of collegiate athletics, which has been reshaped by recent court rulings and NCAA policy changes.</p>

          <p>Despite massive capital expenditures, CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that major tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are underspending on artificial intelligence. He contends that the AI race is a 'winner-take-all' situation, and to secure dominance, even greater investment is necessary. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure to power AI, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and essential for future profitability. He believes the company that develops the most accurate AI, particularly in chatbots, will achieve a near-monopoly similar to Google's dominance in search. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Food Industry Increasingly Turns to Natural Sources for Coloring as Artificial Dyes Are Phased Out</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 19:01:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As regulators like the U.S. FDA move to ban artificial food dyes such as Red Dye No. 3, technology firms are innovating to create stable, vibrant colors from natural sources. Companies are exploring microalgae, specialized carrots, and potatoes to produce pigments that can replace petroleum-based synthetic dyes. This shift presents challenges, as natural colors must match the vividness and shelf-life of their artificial counterparts. Major food giants like Kellogg's and Nestlé have pledged to phase out artificial colors, creating a surge in demand for these new, natural alternatives in the food industry.</p>

The company is restructuring to improve profitability after a period of heavy investment, which includes laying off 15% of its workforce. The report reflects a strategic shift to align investments more closely with customer demand and regain market share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georges Abdallah, a Lebanese militant who became a left-wing symbol for the Palestinian cause, is set to be freed from a French prison after 41 years. Convicted in 1987 for complicity in the murders of an American and an Israeli diplomat, Abdallah's release had been repeatedly denied, allegedly due to pressure from the U.S. and Israel. A French court recently ruled that his continued detention was disproportionate, ordering his release and immediate expulsion to Lebanon. His case remained a cause célèbre for activists who viewed him as one of the world's longest-serving political prisoners.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are scheduled to hold talks with Iran in Istanbul regarding its nuclear program, though prospects for a significant breakthrough are considered low. The meeting follows a warning from the European nations that they will reimpose sanctions if Iran does not show verifiable progress in curbing its nuclear activities. The diplomatic effort aims to revive negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, which stalled after military strikes in June. Analysts believe the European powers are trying to steer the situation away from direct conflict and back toward diplomacy.</p>

After two stellar seasons, including setting multiple rookie records, Nacua has become one of the NFL's best bargains, earning just over $1 million this year. With other young receivers securing deals worth over $90 million, a strong 2025 season could lead to a massive payday for the former fifth-round draft pick.

The order seeks to reverse legal precedents that limit officials' ability to enforce anti-camping laws and aims to redirect funds toward institutional treatment for mental health and substance abuse. The White House framed the move as a public safety measure, while critics like the National Homelessness Law Center condemned it as a punitive action that violates rights and will worsen the crisis.

          <p>This article explores the complexities behind why the Biden administration did not release the full Jeffrey Epstein investigation files, despite their potential political implications for Donald Trump. It explains that grand jury testimony is legally sealed and can only be unsealed by a judge under exceptional circumstances, a hurdle the Trump administration is now facing. Furthermore, the FBI rarely releases evidence from investigations that do not lead to criminal charges to protect privacy and ongoing operations. The piece suggests that even if the Biden administration had wanted to, releasing the files would have faced significant legal and procedural barriers.</p>
