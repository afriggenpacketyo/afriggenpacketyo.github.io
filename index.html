          <p>The government's plans to finalize an agreement regarding the Chagos Islands have been put on hold due to a last-minute legal challenge. A High Court judge issued an injunction in the early hours of Thursday, preventing the government from concluding talks on the Chagos Islands deal. The BBC News App and Twitter are being used to provide breaking news updates on this developing situation. This legal action introduces uncertainty into the future governance and administration of the Chagos Islands. </p>

          <p>The House is expected to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill early Thursday, following the release of an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The legislation, which addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, has faced numerous setbacks due to internal GOP disagreements over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and other provisions. Speaker Mike Johnson negotiated changes to win over both budget hardliners and blue-state Republicans, including adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits. The bill's passage in the House remains uncertain, and it is expected to face resistance in the Senate.</p>

Both artists have faced challenges, including lack of accessibility and institutional rejection, but have found support and recognition through their work, which speaks to personal experiences of gender, disability, and family.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, which is ¬£1 billion more than the same month last year, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since records began in 1993. While tax receipts increased by over ¬£5 billion due to higher National Insurance contributions from employers, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at ¬£148.3 billion, which is ¬£3.7 billion less than initially estimated but still ¬£11 billion more than the Office for Budget Responsibility expected.</p>

There is no evidence that the civil rights of white South Africans have been systematically trampled on, or that white landowners face disproportionate violence.

          <p>An independent sentencing review suggests that violent criminals, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving just a third of their sentence to alleviate prison overcrowding. The review also recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a chemical castration pilot program for sex offenders. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasized the need for major reforms to address dangerous prison conditions and high reoffending rates. While the government is expected to accept some measures, concerns have been raised about the impact on victims and the strain on the probation service.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. According to James Butterfill, the head of research for CoinShares, the price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. stock markets. The diverging movements of bitcoin and stocks could be the result of investors looking for alternative stores of value. Additionally, Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>

          <p>Despite showing little interest in peace negotiations with Ukraine, Russia's struggling war economy may eventually drive Moscow to the negotiating table. Economic and military pressures, including dwindling military hardware stockpiles, recruitment challenges, and sanctions on revenue-generating exports like oil, are mounting. While Russia aims to intensify offensive operations to gain leverage, its ability to sustain these efforts is limited. A slowdown in the Russian economy, exacerbated by international sanctions, high inflation, and rising costs, is also contributing to the pressure. Tighter sanctions on Russia's oil exports and declining oil prices further strain the country's finances.</p>

From 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to approximately 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particles derived from wildfires, costing around $160 billion. The study, published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment, highlights the increasing frequency of smoke events from wildfires and their impact on mortality. Researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke, which can cause both short-term and long-term health problems.</p>

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling ‚Äúthe nuclear option.‚Äù The waivers set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including the EV mandate requiring all new vehicle sales in California to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue if Congress overrules them. The vote is expected to impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's standards.</p>
