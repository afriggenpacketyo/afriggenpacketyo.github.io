          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's efforts, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk, to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful and a 'gross usurpation of power'. The judge ordered the reinstatement of George Moose as acting president, stating that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including the removal of board members and staff, were illegitimate. The court emphasized USIP's independence from the executive branch, highlighting its role as a think tank supporting both executive and legislative bodies, dealing a blow to the administration's efforts to slash the size of the federal government. The White House has not yet responded to the ruling.</p>

The current system relies on outdated technology, with the FAA resorting to eBay and 3D printers for replacement parts.

          <p>Economists and policy experts are raising concerns that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to increase the federal primary deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade. The bill includes extensions of President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are set to expire, and new tax breaks. While the Trump administration claims the bill includes $1.6 trillion in savings, critics argue that the spending cuts are insufficient to offset the tax breaks, potentially leading to higher interest payments and squeezing federal spending on programs like Social Security.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating, with the 30-year Treasury yield briefly exceeding 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023. Moody's attributed the downgrade to the rising burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates. The rating agency lowered the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, aligning with other major credit rating agencies that had already assigned the U.S. their second-highest available rating. Investor concerns about the downgrade led to initial bond selling, but yields later retreated from their highs as bond buying resumed.</p>

          <p>JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has cautioned that investors are being too complacent following Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating. Dimon highlighted that despite the downgrade, which removed the US's last triple-A credit rating, markets had largely recovered by the end of the day. He warned of an 'extraordinary amount of complacency' and suggested that the possibility of stagflation is significantly higher than investors believe. Moody's cited concerns over the rising US budget deficit and the failure of successive administrations to reverse this trend as reasons for the downgrade.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card balances still high and interest rates remaining elevated, it is crucial for borrowers to consider several key factors when tackling their debt. Credit card interest rates are unlikely to decline materially soon, and debt compounds daily, making it difficult to pay off. Borrowers should explore debt relief options tailored to their specific circumstances, such as debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, or credit counseling. In some cases, credit card debt forgiveness programs may be an option, potentially eliminating a significant portion of the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, championed by President Trump, has garnered bipartisan support but also faces criticism from various groups. While tipped workers could see an average tax cut of $1,260, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on non-tipped workers in the service industry. Some worry that it could lead to wage pressure and create disparities between tipped and non-tipped employees. Additionally, analysts note that lower-income individuals who already owe no federal income taxes may not benefit from the provision, making it more of a middle-income benefit.</p>

Despite Trump's claim that Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire, Putin's statements suggest a continuation of political stalling. The analysis suggests that Putin will continue his war, with people continuing to die, and that Trump's retreat from peace talks could open the door to renewed sanctions or intensified efforts from other nations to pressure Putin.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring major companies to absorb the costs of his tariffs rather than pass them on to consumers, as businesses signal they may need to raise prices. Trump directly addressed Walmart, demanding it 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' arguing the company's profits allow it to shoulder the added expenses. This stance contrasts with the widely held economic belief that tariffs primarily affect U.S. companies and consumers. Despite concerns about the economic risks of the trade war, the White House insists its strategy is working and that foreign countries will ultimately bear the cost of tariffs.</p>
