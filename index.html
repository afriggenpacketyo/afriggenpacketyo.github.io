          <p>Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a 14-year-old cricketer, experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes in the Indian Premier League (IPL). After becoming the youngest player to score a men's T20 century in a match against Gujarat Titans, he was dismissed for a duck in his subsequent game against Rajasthan Royals. This dismissal contributed to his team, Mumbai Indians', struggles, as they were eventually bowled out for 117, leading to a 100-run defeat. Despite the loss, Mumbai still managed to top the table with seven wins and four defeats, while Rajasthan remained in eighth place.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed charges against Henrry Villatoro Santos, who was accused of being a regional leader of the MS-13 gang. The Justice Department requested the dismissal to deport Villatoro Santos, whose arrest was announced at a nationally televised press conference. Villatoro Santos's attorney criticized the lack of explanation for withdrawing the charges and questioned the attempt to bypass due-process protections. The attorney warned of a potential unlawful deportation and referenced past instances when the administration had defied court orders in deportation cases, but government attorneys argued that the defense had already delayed the case beyond its initial request.</p>

          <p>"CBS Mornings" co-host Nate Burleson faced his fear of sharks by diving cage-free with Galapagos sharks off Oahu's North Shore as part of the "Never Too Late" series.

He swam with nine Galapagos sharks, some over 10 feet long, and felt a sense of mutual respect, challenging the negative portrayal of sharks popularized by films like "Jaws."

          <p>The Trump administration has halted $1 billion in funding for children's mental health services, authorized by Congress in 2022 following the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting.

The department alleges that grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions, such as recruiting quotas, which could harm students. Senator Christopher S.

          <p>Apple reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street closely monitoring the company's response to the Trump administration's tariffs. Investors are keen to understand the potential impacts of tariffs on Apple's sales, earnings, and product prices, as the company generates about three-quarters of its revenue from physical products made in China. Analysts are also looking for insights into the current quarter's performance and Apple's sales in China amid rising economic tensions. Tariffs might have one silver lining for Apple — customers in the U.S. and retailers may have stocked up on iPhones and other products to beat the tariffs, which could elevate the March quarter's revenue.</p>

          <p>McDonald's and General Motors have warned that uncertainty around Donald Trump's tariff policy is hurting business, hitting sales and knocking profits. McDonald’s reported a 3.6% fall in sales in its US home market during the first quarter, driven mainly by lower customer numbers as consumers reined in their spending in the face of an unpredictable economic outlook. GM cut its profit guidance for the coming year, and cautioned that Trump’s tariffs could cost it as much as $5bn in 2025. Carmakers have been struggling to keep up with Trump’s frequent changes to his plans for sweeping levies, which have also forced Stellantis and Mercedes to withdraw their financial guidance for the year as a result of the uncertainty around tariff policy.</p>

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April as consumers rushed to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. This "tariff fear-buying" began in late March and continued into April, supported by automakers offering discounts or promising not to raise prices. However, demand slowed in late April as vehicle inventories tightened and prices increased. While some tariffs were modified, additional levies on auto parts are expected to begin soon, which could lead to lower sales in future weeks.</p>

Mr. Trump is attempting to create a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts, in which he and his appointees can override written law when they want to. He has attacked at least five pillars of American democracy in his first 100 days: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech and freedom of the press, and government for the people.</p>

The price hikes come as US tariffs stir global economic uncertainty, though Microsoft has not explicitly linked the increase to tariffs.
