          <h2>Federal Judge Issues Temporary Injunction Against Alleged Discriminatory Immigration Stops in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 21:37:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops in Southern California that are allegedly based on racial profiling. The ruling follows a lawsuit by immigrant rights groups, which presented substantial evidence of agents targeting individuals based on their appearance, language, or presence at locations like car washes and Home Depots. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that these practices likely violate the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The order also mandates that detainees be granted 24-hour access to legal counsel, marking a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>New York Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo has publicly criticized the Major League Baseball All-Star selection process, labeling it as "broken." He specifically objects to the rule that guarantees every team at least one representative, arguing that the game should feature the league's best players, not just the best player from each team. Nimmo, who is having a strong season alongside teammate Juan Soto, was not selected for the midsummer classic, fueling his critique of the long-standing policy. Despite his and Soto's snubs, the Mets will still be represented by four other players in the upcoming All-Star Game.</p>

          <h2>Lord Huron's Decade-Old Song "The Night We Met" Achieves Massive Streaming Success</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The song "The Night We Met" by indie band Lord Huron has become a massive sleeper hit a decade after its initial 2015 release. Originally an overlooked album track, its inclusion in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017 initiated a slow burn of popularity, which has since been amplified by viral trends on TikTok. The wistful ballad has now surpassed three billion streams on Spotify, a milestone even Taylor Swift has not yet reached, and consistently outperforms contemporary hits on global charts. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes its enduring appeal to its relatable theme of lost love.</p>

          <p>Popular British soft toy company Jellycat has ceased supplying its products to approximately 100 independent shops across the UK, leaving many small business owners feeling devastated and confused. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the brand for over two decades, received a generic email stating the decision was part of a "brand elevation strategy" and was non-negotiable. This move comes after a surge in Jellycat's popularity, driven by social media, which had already caused stock shortages for smaller stores. The affected shop owners and their customers feel the company is abandoning the independent businesses that helped build its success.</p>

Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and is married to a citizen, had applied for parole-in-place, a status available to relatives of military members. His family expressed relief at the judge's decision but remains concerned about the injuries he sustained during the arrest and plans to seek immediate medical care.</p>

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the historic Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague is facing significant opposition from architects, preservationists, and the public. The authority argues that the 123-year-old structure is corroded and can no longer handle the projected increase in rail traffic, proposing to replace it with a new, three-track bridge. However, a coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and endorsed by Unesco, contends that the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money. The debate highlights the classic conflict between modern infrastructure needs and the preservation of a city's architectural heritage.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old from Massachusetts with non-speaking autism, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For the first 14 years of his life, Viraj was unable to communicate effectively due to apraxia, leading many to believe he was severely mentally disabled. His single father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his thumb, unlocking a brilliant mind that had been trapped. In just three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus and now hopes his story will inspire a re-evaluation of the potential within the non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>The BBC is confronting a dilemma regarding the broadcast of its latest MasterChef series, which was filmed before presenter Gregg Wallace was sacked over misconduct allegations. With Wallace featured throughout the completed season, the corporation must decide whether to air the show, shelve it entirely, or find an alternative like an iPlayer-only release. Airing it could be seen as disrespectful to the accusers and provoke a backlash, while canceling it would be a major disappointment to the contestants and crew. The situation is complicated by new allegations against Wallace, which he denies, leaving the show's immediate future uncertain.</p>

          <p>A large-scale federal raid on the Glass House cannabis operation in Southern California has resulted in the detention of nearly 200 workers and sparked chaotic protests. Agents from multiple federal agencies executed warrants at the company's facilities, leading to a panicked scene where workers hid to evade capture and demonstrators clashed with law enforcement. The Trump administration framed the operation as a move against the exploitation of undocumented workers, while local officials condemned it as a disproportionate and terrorizing action against a legal business. The raid highlights the precarious position of the state-legal cannabis industry.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit young users for commercial gain. The state's attorney general argues these features are designed to maximize engagement, thereby increasing exposure to ads and driving purchases. In his ruling, the judge found the state's claims were specific enough and focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features, not its user-generated content, marking an important step in the state's effort to hold the company accountable.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is facing criticism over his government's handling of trade negotiations with the United States following President Trump's latest threat of a 35% tariff. Carney, who won the election promising to take a tough "elbows up" approach with Trump, has since made concessions, such as scrapping a planned digital services tax. These moves have so far failed to de-escalate the trade conflict, leading some commentators to question whether his strategy is effective or if he is backing down from his assertive promises.

The hiring follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI.

Although officials have reportedly backed away from shuttering FEMA entirely, they continue to advocate for reforms that would shift more disaster-response responsibility to the states.
