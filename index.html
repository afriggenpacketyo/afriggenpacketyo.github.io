          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a boost following Elon Musk's announcement of a tentative robotaxi launch date in Austin, Texas, slated for June 22, with the first driverless ride scheduled for Musk's birthday. This news provided a spark of hope for Tesla's autonomous vehicle strategy, which is viewed as crucial for the company's future growth. Additionally, signs of a cooldown in the public spat between Musk and President Donald Trump contributed to the positive market sentiment, with Musk expressing regret over some of his recent social media posts about Trump, helping ease investor concerns about potential political repercussions for Tesla. The stock initially showed positive momentum before turning negative in the afternoon, though it remained up over 10% for the week.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled the government's Spending Review, outlining departmental budgets for the next three years, with the NHS receiving a 3% annual funding increase and additional funds allocated to defense and housing. Education will also see a significant boost, particularly for school repairs and training, while other departments like the Home Office and Foreign Office face budget cuts, as the NHS increase covers day-to-day spending but capital spending will remain static, raising concerns about the capacity to increase operations and procedures. The review includes substantial investments in social housing and infrastructure projects, though the benefits of these plans may not materialize until the 2030s, as business groups have expressed support for the ambitious plans, hoping it will encourage firms to invest and boost business. </p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to revoke a key rule established by the Biden administration that limited carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants, a move projected to significantly increase carbon emissions. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration aims to balance environmental protection with economic growth, arguing that the previous rules were economically stifling, as the EPA also intends to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, potentially increasing harmful pollutants. Critics, including former Obama EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, argue that the rollback disregards decades of scientific and policy review, while environmental groups are prepared to pursue legal challenges, as the EPA estimates the new rules will save over $1 billion per year.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of sexual assault in a New York retrial, adding to his existing 16-year sentence for sex crimes in Los Angeles, as the jury found him guilty of assaulting Miriam Haley but not guilty of assaulting Kaja Sokola and were unable to reach a verdict on the charge involving Jessica Mann. The retrial stemmed from an overturned 2020 conviction due to the admission of testimony from women beyond the charges at hand, and the defense argued that the encounters were consensual, while the prosecution presented the women's accounts of Weinstein using his power to sexually abuse them. The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men, as Weinstein's spokesperson indicated that they believe there are serious appellate issues that will be explored.</p>

          <p>In Harvey Weinstein's sex crimes retrial in New York, the jury reached a split verdict, convicting him on one count of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitting him on another count, as the Manhattan jury was unable to reach a verdict on the third count of rape, and the judge instructed them to continue deliberating. The retrial involved accusations of sexual assault from three women, Mimi Haley, Jessica Mann, and Kaja Sokola, with Weinstein being convicted of a criminal sex act with Haley but acquitted of the same charge regarding Sokola, as the prosecution argued that Weinstein used his power in Hollywood to prey on the women, while the defense claimed the relationships were consensual. The trial followed an overturned conviction from 2020, and the jurors will resume deliberations on the rape count involving Mann.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia launched a Senate campaign ad targeting Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff over the rioting in Los Angeles, criticizing his perceived lack of response to the unrest caused by immigration raids, as the ad accuses Ossoff of being "MIA" and highlights his continued use of pronouns on social media, a common point of contention for Republicans. Ossoff's office clarified that he is currently on paternity leave after welcoming a baby daughter, but this did not deter the criticism, as a PAC aligned with GOP Sen. Tom Cotton also released an ad targeting Ossoff's voting record on immigration and healthcare. The attacks suggest that Republicans see Ossoff, who was first elected in a January 2021 runoff, as a vulnerable target in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

Federal prosecutors have charged two men for throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers, while 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest, as Mayor Karen Bass declared a curfew in a downtown area due to vandalism and looting. The immigration raids that sparked the protests have continued, alongside the National Guard deployment, as Trump vowed to "liberate" the city, prompting criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accused the president of an "assault" on democracy.</p>

Fairbank's positive outlook contrasts with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's warning about a potential economic downturn, as the consumer continues to spend, that's more sales for companies and it's supportive for the U.S. economy overall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) will now offer ranking protection to female tennis players who choose to freeze their eggs or embryos, allowing them to start a family at a later date without jeopardizing their careers, as the offer is available to any player ranked in the world's top 750 who spends more than 10 weeks out of competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, emphasized that the rule will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly, as she has used the off-season to freeze her eggs twice previously, and now players don't feel forced to come back early and risk their health again.</p>

          <p>A group of drag performers is planning a protest during President Trump and Vice President Vance's attendance at the opening performance of Les MisÃ©rables at the Kennedy Center, after attendees donated tickets in response to Trump's pledge to stop drag shows at the center, as Trump has criticized past programming at the center, leading to the firing of key personnel and the appointment of new board members. The Kennedy Center was not immediately available for comment, but one performer, Vagenesis, emphasized that the protest would be peaceful, aiming to show that they are not backing down in the face of bigotry.</p>

Prosecutors also stated that there may be other possible victims, and that Woeltz and Duplessie have tortured people before, as the defense argued that there is video evidence of the alleged victim "having the time of his life" and engaging in activity at odds with having been tortured.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market presents a complex picture for potential homebuyers, with affordability remaining a significant obstacle due to elevated mortgage rates and high median home prices, although inventory is rising in many markets, particularly in the South, providing buyers with more negotiation power. Experts anticipate modest declines in home prices by the end of 2025, but mortgage rates are expected to remain above 6% throughout the year, as tariffs on building materials are expected to increase construction costs, potentially slowing new homebuilding and adding upward pressure to prices. This creates a challenging situation for buyers, as mortgage rates are unlikely to fall significantly unless tariffs are eliminated or the country enters a severe recession (not investment advice).</p>

However, the article contends that the left's tactics and rhetoric helped enable Trump's return to power, and that liberal critics of those tactics deserve credit for anticipating the backlash, as the author draws parallels to the McCarthyism era, arguing that the left's failure to acknowledge the threat of communism ultimately empowered McCarthy.</p>

The committee said people with diabetes who are exposed to semaglutide are at a twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION compared with those not taking it, as the committee said patients should stop treatment with semaglutide products if they experience the side effect, and a study found that diabetes patients who use GLP-1 drugs were twice as likely to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration.</p>
