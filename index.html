          <p>In a game where Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown, Iowa defeated Albany 34-7, allowing Kirk Ferentz to tie Woody Hayes as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his first start for Iowa, contributed a passing and rushing touchdown before experiencing cramping issues. Albany briefly led in the second quarter, but Iowa quickly responded with a touchdown drive led by Williams. Ferentz, now in his 27th season, has a 205-124 record at Iowa and a 217-145 career record, marking his 23rd season-opening win. With Gronowski aiming to improve Iowa's passing game, the Hawkeyes prepare to face Iowa State next week after the dominant victory. The author's tone is celebratory in light of the victory and Kirk Ferentz's achievement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the case of Alix Tichelman, who pleaded guilty to prostitution and involuntary manslaughter in connection to the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The author questions whether Hayes, who arranged the meeting and invited Tichelman to inject him with heroin, bears some responsibility for his own demise. The author points out that Tichelman called 911 after her boyfriend overdosed on heroin some time before Forrest's death. The author also highlights the complexities of blame and accountability in this tragic situation, suggesting that the answers lie in ethics rather than forensics. The reflection on the tragic circumstances yields a score reflecting the gravity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Amtrak's NextGen Acela high-speed trains are now operating between Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C., reaching speeds of 160 mph and offering upgraded amenities. The new trains hold 80 more passengers, feature upgraded seats, larger windows, faster Wi-Fi, and a self-serve food bar. The Acela trains are assembled in upstate New York, and all 28 are expected to be in service by 2027. The trains are designed to lean into curves, allowing them to maintain higher speeds on older tracks, and meet stronger crashworthiness standards. The implementation of these technologically advanced trains signifies a step forward for high-speed rail in America.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that her party, if elected, would remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies drilling in the North Sea. The plan focuses solely on maximizing extraction of resources, a move away from previous climate policies. The Labour government has committed to banning new exploration licenses, arguing that exploring new fields would not lower bills or improve energy security. Badenoch argues that current requirements are damaging the economy, stating it's absurd that the UK leaves vital resources untapped. The political implications of this shift in energy policy is significant.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to protect residents' rights amid concerns of a potential federal agent deployment. The order seeks to prevent the Chicago Police Department from cooperating with federal authorities on immigration enforcement and restricts officers from concealing their identities. Johnson criticized the President's approach as unconstitutional and a dangerous power grab, vowing to defend the city's democracy. The order directs city departments to provide information on residents' rights and submit Freedom of Information Act requests to the Department of Homeland Security. The Mayor's actions aim to reassure residents and send a message to the White House.</p>

          <p>The United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America (VOA), is laying off more than 500 employees, according to a Trump administration official. This action follows a judge's order preventing the firing of VOA director Michael Abramowitz. CEO Kari Lake stated the layoffs aim to improve the agency's functioning, while employees condemn the attacks and vow to fight for their rights. The layoffs are part of a broader effort to reduce federal bureaucracy and align with Trump's directives. The move affects multiple entities, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.</p>

          <p>A showpeople family, the Stringfellows, is fighting eviction from their long-time home on Water Row in Govan, Glasgow, to make way for a new development. The family has lived on the site for over 40 years, but Glasgow City Council claims they have no right to occupy the land. The case is heading to Scotland's highest court and could set a legal precedent regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The family argues that eviction would breach the rights of a five-year-old child living on the site to a secure home. The legal battle raises questions about balancing urban development with the rights of marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>German beer sales are declining, but non-alcoholic beer is becoming increasingly popular, with sales more than doubling since 2013. The Erdinger brewery is adapting to changing drinking habits by promoting its alcohol-free beer at sporting events. At Café Kosmos in Munich, customers are more health-conscious, opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic ones. While full-strength beer is still dominant, there's a noticeable shift towards mindful consumption. While some traditional beer festivals, such as the Sandkerwa folk festival in Bamberg, maintain strong beer-drinking traditions, there is an overall trend towards reduced alcohol consumption.</p>

          <p>Konami has released a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3, years after the departure of series creator Hideo Kojima.

Fans view Metal Gear Solid 3 as a good entry point for newcomers due to its balance of gameplay and cinematic storytelling.

          <p>Learner drivers in the UK are facing increasing abuse and intimidation from other road users, with many experiencing tailgating and aggressive behavior. Instructors are installing dashcams to capture evidence of such incidents, which can lead to legal action.

Impatience from other drivers towards learner drivers and their instructors is growing, prompting calls for more empathy and kindness on the roads.

          <p>The article delves into the largely unregulated industry of body brokers in the US, where private companies acquire corpses, dissect them, and sell the body parts for profit. While some argue this is essential for medical research, critics view it as a modern form of grave-robbing. The US lacks a national law prohibiting the sale of human tissue, leading to ethical concerns and exploitation. The industry has grown due to a gap in US regulation, turning the country into a global exporter of cadavers.</p>

          <p>A study shows that pupils in England who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were more likely to miss large parts during the rest of the year. More than half of pupils who were partially absent in week one became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. The Education Secretary is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term. The study underscores the importance of establishing good attendance habits early in the school year.</p>
