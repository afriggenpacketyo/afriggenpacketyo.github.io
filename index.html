          <p>European stock markets experienced further declines as traders processed the recently announced in-depth details of a trade agreement between the EU and the U.S. This article highlights that the deal confirmed a 15% tariff cap on EU pharmaceuticals exported to the U.S., alleviating prior concerns about potential tariffs as high as 250%. However, automotive stocks closed in negative territory, reacting to the conditional nature of their lower tariffs, which are contingent on Brussels reducing its own industrial duties. The broader market sentiment remains cautious as investors await key economic data from major European economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reports that U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly reduced the threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union. Previously, these sectors faced potential tariffs as high as 250% and 100% respectively, but new details of the US-EU agreement now cap them at 15%. However, the deal includes a condition: the 27.5% tariff on European car exports will only be reduced to 15% once the EU passes legislation to cut its own industrial duties to zero. This agreement, described as a "first step," aims to provide stability in the world's largest trading partnership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, facing ongoing and extraordinary attacks from President Donald Trump to cut interest rates. Despite Trump's repeated public criticisms and calls for his resignation, the Fed has maintained rates for five consecutive meetings, seeking more clarity on the economic impact of the administration's policies. This article highlights that investors and economists are keenly awaiting Powell's address for clues on the Fed's future monetary policy, with a 73.5% chance of a rate cut anticipated at the September meeting. This will be Powell's final speech at the annual gathering before his term expires next May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed component suppliers to cease production of its China-specific H20 general processing units, following a Chinese government directive for local tech companies to stop purchasing these chips. Beijing cited alleged security concerns, prompting Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to publicly address the issue, denying any "backdoors" in their products and stating the company is in discussions with Chinese authorities. This article highlights that the move significantly complicates Nvidia's business in the lucrative Chinese market, especially after previously securing export licenses for the H20s, and underscores ongoing U.S.-China trade uncertainties and China's drive for chip self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order concerning stray dogs in New Delhi, now directing authorities to catch, sterilize, and immunize the animals before releasing them, except for rabid or aggressive cases. The court also banned public feeding of strays, mandating designated feeding zones and threatening legal action for violations. This article notes that the decision follows widespread protests against an earlier order for mass removal and relocation, with critics highlighting logistical challenges and the importance of existing animal birth control rules. The court will centralize similar cases to form a nationwide policy.</p>

This article notes that rice inflation, which had previously surged, showed signs of easing to 90.7%. Despite the slight moderation, the 3.1% headline inflation marks the 40th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to suggest the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.

However, the outlook for next year, particularly around Easter, appears "sweeter" as industrial demand softens and supply improves with new plantings reaching maturity.

          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas, linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This article highlights findings published in the journal Science, based on surveys in maize fields in Hainan. The research indicates that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also reduced growth. This mechanism offers valuable clues on how optimizing linalool release could be used to combat pests and potentially increase crop yield, contributing to agricultural advancements.</p>
