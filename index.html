          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article analyzes which nations might align with the United States or China in a hypothetical military conflict over Taiwan. It concludes that few countries would offer significant military support to either side, with China's allies like North Korea and Russia being unreliable for different reasons. Similarly, US allies such as Japan and the Philippines would likely offer only limited, cautious assistance, highlighting a global reluctance to be drawn into a direct confrontation between the two superpowers. The piece suggests the US itself may lack the appetite for such a war.</p>

          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share. The company announced a significant increase in its capital expenditure forecast for 2025, raising it by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, primarily to support growing demand for its Cloud and AI services. Despite increased competition, Google's core search and advertising businesses demonstrated strong growth, and its YouTube and Cloud segments also outperformed revenue predictions. The company's AI products, AI Overviews and the Gemini app, showed substantial user growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 international aid and human rights organizations has issued a stark warning about mass starvation unfolding in Gaza, urging global governments to intervene. The groups, including Oxfam and Save the Children, report that their own staff and the local population are "wasting away" due to a severe blockade on supplies. The statement highlights catastrophic conditions, including record malnutrition rates in children, the spread of disease, and the killing of hundreds of Palestinians attempting to access scarce aid. Israel has rejected the statement, accusing the organizations of echoing Hamas propaganda.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of the word "OK," tracing its origins to a linguistic fad in 1830s Boston where phrases were humorously abbreviated and misspelled. "OK" began as a joke, standing for "oll korrect," a misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as it aligned with his nickname, "Old Kinderhook." Now considered one of the most universally understood words, its simplicity and versatility made it ideal for the telegraph age and its global spread was accelerated by American soldiers in the 20th century.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to accelerate innovation and maintain America's lead in the artificial intelligence race. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions aimed at supporting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, modernizing the electric grid, and streamlining regulations to remove barriers to AI development. It also establishes rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems and creates a program to export AI packages to U.S. allies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on profits from the sale of primary residences. This move, aimed at stimulating the housing market, follows the introduction of the "No Tax on Home Sales Act" by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to capital gains tax. While the proposal could benefit many homeowners, particularly in high-value markets, experts suggest that raising the existing exemption is a more likely outcome than a complete elimination of the tax.

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its focus on what it terms "woke" artificial intelligence, implementing policies to counter perceived left-leaning ideological bias in AI models. The new AI Action Plan will revise federal guidelines to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and will restrict government contracts to tech firms that ensure their systems permit free expression. This initiative frames AI development as a culture war issue, driven by conservative beliefs that safety guardrails on chatbots censor right-wing viewpoints.

          <h2>Earth Overshoot Day Arrives Earlier in 2025, Signaling Increased Resource Depletion</h2>

          <p>Earth Overshoot Day, the date when humanity's demand for ecological resources exceeds what the planet can regenerate in a year, fell on July 24 in 2025. This is over a week earlier than the previous year, a shift largely attributed to new data showing oceans absorb less CO2 than previously thought. The report from the Global Footprint Network highlights a trend of overconsumption since the 1970s, leading to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and atmospheric carbon accumulation. While high-income nations like Qatar and the U.S. reach their overshoot days very early, the article notes that solutions like carbon pricing and renewable energy could significantly push the date back.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, led by Trump appointee Bill Essayli, is reportedly struggling to secure indictments in cases against individuals accused of misconduct during protests against immigration raids. Grand juries have refused to indict in several cases, an uncommon outcome that raises questions about the strength of the evidence being presented. Some cases have been dismissed or reduced to misdemeanors, with defense attorneys and some insiders claiming that criminal complaints are based on unreliable or false statements from federal immigration agents. The difficulties highlight a potential disconnect between the prosecutor's priorities and community sentiment.</p>

          <p>In a pair of significant rulings, federal judges in Tennessee and Maryland have acted to protect Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national facing human smuggling charges. One judge ordered his release from criminal custody, while another barred ICE from immediately detaining him, requiring 72 hours' notice before any removal proceedings. Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador in what the government called an "administrative error," despite a court order protecting him. The new rulings are seen as a rebuke of the government's handling of the case and a crucial safeguard for his due process rights.</p>

          <p>Dr. Salvador Plasencia has pleaded guilty in federal court to four counts of illegally distributing ketamine to actor Matthew Perry in the month before his death. Perry died from the acute effects of the drug in October 2023. In a plea agreement, Plasencia admitted to supplying Perry with unprescribed vials of ketamine, lozenges, and syringes for $4,500. The plea carries a potential maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. In a statement, the doctor's attorneys said he is "profoundly remorseful" and hopes the case serves as a warning about the risks in the growing at-home ketamine treatment industry.</p>

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City was a pivotal moment that fundamentally changed how the United States responds to missing children cases. The case, which recently returned to the news with a retrial ordered for the man convicted of his murder, ended an era of parental complacency and sparked a national movement. It led to the end of mandatory waiting periods for filing missing person reports, the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the famous milk carton campaigns. This societal shift created a more urgent and coordinated law enforcement approach to protecting children.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "corn sweat" refers to the process of evapotranspiration, where vast fields of corn release significant moisture into the atmosphere during hot, sunny weather. This phenomenon dramatically increases humidity, making the air feel more oppressive and elevating the heat index to dangerous levels, as seen in recent Midwest heat waves. While the process itself has a slight cooling effect, the intense humidity it creates can offset this, trapping heat and preventing nighttime cooling. This agricultural reality, driven by monoculture farming, exacerbates the human impact of extreme heat events that are becoming more common with climate change.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a controversial law that curtails the powers of the country's independent anti-corruption bodies, NABU and SAPO. The new law grants the prosecutor general, a presidential appointee, significant oversight and control over anti-corruption investigations, a move critics say destroys the agencies' independence. The decision sparked street protests in Kyiv and drew sharp criticism from EU officials, who called it a "serious step back" that could threaten Ukraine's path to EU accession and endanger international financial aid. President Zelenskyy defended the move as necessary to root out Russian influence from the agencies.</p>

This move follows the company's removal of nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children, which led to the removal of an additional 500,000 linked accounts. The company is now automatically placing teen accounts into its strictest settings to filter offensive messages and limit contact from unknown adults. These updates come amid increasing pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general over the platform's impact on youth mental health and safety.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit would earn more interest in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. A CD offers a high, fixed interest rate but requires locking the money away, while a high-yield savings account provides flexibility with a variable rate. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. The CD's return is also guaranteed, whereas the savings account's rate is likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The movie is commended for its lean narrative, crisp visuals, and emotionally credible performances from its cast, including Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby. By valuing its characters' "lameness" and dignity, the film successfully reboots the franchise with a unique and charmingly vintage sensibility.</p>
