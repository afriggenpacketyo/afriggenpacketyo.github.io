          <p>Millions of activists and advocacy groups participated in "No Kings" protests across the U.S. on Saturday, demonstrating against President Trump's policies, including immigration crackdowns and troop deployments. Organizers, like MoveOn, emphasized their love for the country and the fight for its values. Despite Republican claims of "Hate America" rallies, participants remained peaceful, with no reports of violence or arrests. The protests aimed to challenge what they perceive as the administration's authoritarian tendencies and abuse of power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and the White House engaged in a heated social media exchange regarding the temporary closure of Interstate 5 for the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton. Newsom criticized the live-fire demonstration as "dangerous" and a "vanity parade," accusing the White House of endangering the public. The White House, in turn, accused Newsom of lying and politicizing a training exercise, stating the Marine Corps did not request the closure and had no public safety concerns.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of the 5 Freeway in Southern California was closed for about four hours on Saturday for a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire event at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. This closure occurred despite earlier Marine Corps assurances that public highways would remain open. California Highway Patrol recommended the closure due to "extreme life safety risk and distraction" from live munitions. Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the event as an "absurd show of force," accusing the Trump administration of prioritizing ego over public safety.</p>
