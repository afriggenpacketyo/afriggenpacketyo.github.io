        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of making a false statement and obstruction, stemming from his 2020 testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The interim U.S. Attorney, Lindsey Halligan, appointed by President Trump, described the alleged actions as an extraordinary breach of public trust, while Comey vehemently denied the charges, stating he is innocent and prepared for trial. This development follows years of public animosity between Comey and Trump, who had publicly pressed for Comey's prosecution, leading to the resignation of the previous U.S. attorney who raised concerns about the case. The indictment, coming just days before the statute of limitations was set to expire, has ignited a fierce political debate regarding the independence of the justice system and potential political weaponization.</p>

          <p>U.S. country music superstar Luke Combs highlights the unique and deeply engaged nature of his British fanbase, who he notes consume entire albums rather than just singles, a contrast to his American audiences. Country music has rapidly become the fastest-growing genre in the UK, boasting three billion streams last year, which has encouraged Combs to consistently tour and connect with fans there. The Grammy-nominated artist is in London for a historic, sold-out Grand Ole Opry performance at the Royal Albert Hall, marking the Opry's first show ever outside the United States. Combs credits streaming services for expanding the genre's reach and universal appeal, fostering a strong, appreciative listening crowd in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs, including a 100% levy on imported branded drugs unless manufacturing plants are built in the U.S., a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks, and 50% on kitchen and bathroom cabinets. These measures, announced on Truth Social, are intended to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition and boost domestic jobs, despite opposition from U.S. businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned that such tariffs could increase costs for industries reliant on international supply chains, particularly for truck parts sourced from allied nations. These new duties expand Trump's existing tariff policies, aiming to achieve various political and economic goals by targeting specific industries and global trading partners.</p>

          <p>Blaine Milam, a Texas man, was executed by lethal injection for the 2008 murder of his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, during a torturous ordeal described as an "exorcism." Prosecutors presented evidence of severe abuse, including multiple skull fractures, broken bones, and bite marks, inflicted over 30 hours. Milam, who blamed his girlfriend and claimed the child was demon-possessed, asserted his innocence in a final statement before his death. The execution occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his appeals, which challenged the use of "discredited" bite mark evidence and claims of intellectual disability, marking a somber conclusion to a deeply tragic case.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm of the hurricane season, is swirling north of the Caribbean and could potentially interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, a phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. Although this outcome is unlikely, if it occurs, the two storms could merge or spin around a common center, with the stronger system typically absorbing the weaker one. Forecasters expect Humberto to strengthen into a hurricane, while the second system, likely to become Tropical Storm Imelda, tracks towards the Bahamas, increasing risks for the southeastern U.S. coastal areas. The National Hurricane Center is closely monitoring both systems for any changes to their predicted paths.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia, were seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport and subsequently found a new home at the New York Aquarium. The seized coral, protected under the Endangered Species Act and international conservation agreements, was in poor health after five days in transit and would have perished without the aquarium's intervention. Aquarium staff, who describe the facility as a "coral hospital," have successfully nursed many of the corals back to health, moving them to public display. These corals now serve as ambassadors for their species, educating visitors about the importance of protecting marine life and combating illegal wildlife trade.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress have dismissed the White House's threat of large-scale federal workforce layoffs ahead of a potential government shutdown as an "intimidation" tactic. This reaction follows a White House memo advising federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force notices for employees in discretionary-funded programs, in addition to furlough warnings. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move, accusing the Trump administration of using federal workers as leverage in budget negotiations. Democrats remain steadfast in their demands for health care priorities, asserting that a shutdown would be the Republicans' responsibility given their control of both legislative chambers and the presidency.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, known as reduction-in-force notices, if Congress fails to pass a government funding bill by the October 1 deadline.

An OMB official clarified that essential services like Social Security and military operations would continue, but former officials criticized the move as an "enormous self-harm" and an "extortive" tactic.

          <p>Residents of Lucas Valley, California, are on edge due to an unusually aggressive squirrel that has attacked several people, sending at least two to the emergency room with bites and scratches. One 80-year-old woman described being startled by the squirrel on her leg during a morning walk, while a flier warned residents of its unpredictable attacks. Animal experts suggest that such aggression is rare and likely stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising wildlife, causing the animals to lose their natural fear and become confrontational when not given food. Officials caution against feeding wild animals to prevent similar dangerous interactions and potential disease transmission.</p>

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller framed it as an unprecedented, all-of-government effort to dismantle left-wing terrorism and "antifa."

He noted that AI giants are engaged in multi-billion dollar deals and infrastructure projects, contrasting sharply with consumer companies like CarMax, KB Home, and Starbucks, which are underperforming. Cramer argues that despite strong GDP growth, the economic strength is concentrated in tech, with little intersection with the daily lives of the broader workforce.

Raynae Madison, who discovered the stone, initially doubted its authenticity due to its substantial size, but park staff at the Diamond Discovery Center confirmed its identity and unique inclusions. These brown diamonds acquire their color from plastic deformation during formation, causing them to reflect specific light wavelengths. Named the William Diamond in honor of her nephew, this find underscores the park's ongoing appeal as a unique public diamond-hunting site.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a vital suicide prevention charity, faces a potential exodus of hundreds of volunteers if controversial plans to close over 100 branches across the UK and Ireland are approved. Opponents argue that shifting to a remote working model and consolidating into larger offices would decimate local community work and jeopardize the charity's ability to answer calls. A survey revealed that three-quarters of Welsh volunteers would not continue if their branches closed or if forced into remote work, citing concerns about support during difficult calls. Volunteers accuse leadership of ignoring their feedback and failing to provide a clear rationale for changes, leading to widespread "despair and disillusionment."</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has moved out of the takeover spotlight, with its shares climbing over 32% since early April, outperforming rivals and dispelling earlier speculation about potential acquisitions by Shell or U.S. majors. This improved sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress in cost-cutting, and a string of recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth to drive shareholder value, while analysts noted the positive impact of a new chair with turnaround experience. The company's strong second-quarter results, including underlying replacement cost profit of $2.35 billion, further solidified its position. (not investment advice)</p>
