          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 15:37:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Mike Waltz would be nominated as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, following reports of Waltz's departure as National Security Advisor. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily take on the responsibilities of National Security Advisor. This shakeup comes after Waltz faced scrutiny for a Signal chat incident involving leaked military attack plans. The move also follows criticism of Waltz's alignment with Trump's MAGA supporters, with some considering him not conservative enough, leading to internal conflicts within the White House and the National Security Council. This marks the first major staff change in Trump's second term, occurring shortly after his 100th day in office.</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to release its first-quarter earnings, with analysts closely watching the potential effects of President Trump's tariffs on the company's retail business. While Amazon is working to keep prices low by strategically managing inventory, third-party sellers may need to pass tariff costs to consumers. Analysts believe the tariffs could initially boost Amazon's retail sales as shoppers stock up in anticipation of price hikes. Investors are also focusing on the performance of Amazon Web Services and the company's investments in artificial intelligence, as Amazon pledges to boost capital expenditures to $100 billion in 2025, primarily for AI services.</p>

          <p>Harrods, the luxury department store in London, is the latest British retailer to fall victim to a cyberattack, raising concerns about online security vulnerabilities.

The UN Secretary-General also offered to mediate, highlighting international concern over potential military confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbors.

          <p>President Trump announced that any country or person purchasing oil or petrochemicals from Iran will face immediate secondary sanctions, barring them from doing business with the U.S. This move is part of Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aimed at shutting down the country's oil exports and limiting funding for militant groups. The sanctions are primarily directed at China, which imports over one million barrels per day from Iran. While analysts believe the sanctions may not significantly impact Iranian oil flow to China unless Beijing's state-owned enterprises are targeted, Trump's actions underscore his negotiating strategy with Iran.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest May Day ever, with a temperature of 29.3 degrees Celsius (84.7 degrees Fahrenheit) at Kew Gardens, following the sunniest April since records began. The high temperatures and dry conditions have led to numerous fires across the country, with over 400 recorded this year. Scientists warn that climate change, driven by fossil fuel emissions, is making periods of intense heat more likely and longer-lasting.
