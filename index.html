            <p>US Vice-President JD Vance indicated a strong possibility of a trade deal with the UK, amidst President Trump's new tariffs on imports from various countries. Vance highlighted the "reciprocal relationship" between the US and UK, contrasting it with other nations like Germany. Trump's tariffs have caused stock market instability, but Vance defended the strategy as a long-term play to reduce trade deficits. He also addressed concerns about US-Europe relations, emphasizing his affinity for European culture and the need for Europe to strengthen its own defense. The trade deal talks come amidst ongoing global trade shakeups initiated by the Trump administration.</p>

            <p>A team of researchers in China have identified how breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to bypass the immune system and proliferate. The discovery highlights the metabolic communication between cancer cells and macrophages, which plays a crucial role in cancer progression. This finding could lead to new precision therapies that target arginine metabolism in tumors, offering a potential new avenue for treating the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. The study, published in Cancer Cell, suggests starving tumors of arginine could be a promising therapeutic approach.</p>

            <p>Senior advisers within President Trump's inner circle privately cautioned that proposed tariffs could trigger devastating effects on global financial markets and destabilize the US economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick voiced concerns about the potential for market turmoil. Despite these warnings, trade adviser Peter Navarro advocated for across-the-board tariffs, leading to internal disagreements. Following the announcement of the tariffs, financial markets experienced significant losses, prompting Trump to temporarily pause some tariffs after input from Bessent and Lutnick.

            <p>A federal funding freeze by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the country. Over 22 tribes and nonprofits have had approximately $350 million in federal funding suspended, often without notice, impacting projects ranging from housing renovations to riverbank stabilization. These projects, funded through the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, aimed to address climate change threats and improve community infrastructure. The funding uncertainty has left tribes struggling to address critical needs and facing financial challenges.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration asserts it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite court orders and a Supreme Court ruling mandating his return. Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error. Joseph Mazzara, acting General Counsel at DHS, stated that DHS does not have the authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation. This claim was made hours after El Salvador President Nayib Bukele refused to return Abrego Garcia.</p>

The FTC claims Meta overpaid for these acquisitions as a defensive move, while Meta contends the acquisitions improved the consumer experience. Meta has also been making overtures to Trump, including contributing to his inaugural fund and adding Trump allies to its board.</p>
