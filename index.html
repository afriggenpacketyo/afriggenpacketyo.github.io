          <p>PayPal announced first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations, despite missing revenue targets due to macroeconomic uncertainties, while maintaining its 2025 forecast. The company's strategy to prioritize profitability over volume led to a 1% increase in sales, with transaction margin dollars growing by 7%. Venmo revenue increased by 20% year over year, driven by increased transaction volume and debit card usage. CEO Alex Chriss is focusing on monetizing acquisitions like Braintree and Venmo to further boost PayPal's financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan and the Philippines are poised to begin discussions on key security pacts to bolster their defense cooperation, with China's increasing maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific region being a major consideration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A five-day software outage at Community Health Systems (CHS) hospitals was triggered by Oracle engineers who mistakenly deleted critical storage linked to a key database. The outage affected multiple hospitals, forcing them to revert to paper-based patient records, with Becker's Hospital Review reporting that 45 hospitals were impacted. CHS, which operates 72 hospitals across 14 states, confirmed that the outage was resolved and did not materially impact services, as hospitals implemented downtime procedures. The incident highlights the vulnerability of healthcare systems to software glitches and the importance of robust backup and recovery plans.</p>

          <p>Venmo, a popular consumer service for sending money to friends, is increasingly contributing to PayPal's business, with revenue growing 20% year-over-year in the first quarter.

This indicates the success of PayPal's efforts to monetize Venmo through specific products like Pay with Venmo, Venmo debit cards, and instant transfers.

          <p>SoFi CEO Anthony Noto announced that the fintech bank will re-enter the cryptocurrency investment space, reversing a previous decision made to secure a bank charter. This shift is driven by a perceived change in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration. SoFi aims to offer crypto investing by year-end and integrate crypto or blockchain technology into its major product lines within the next two years, potentially through acquisitions. The company believes it can leverage crypto technology across its lending, savings, spending, investing, and protection services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors (GM) exceeded Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but is reassessing its full-year financial guidance and suspending stock buybacks due to potential cost increases from automotive tariffs. The company's previous guidance is now considered unreliable until there is more clarity on the economic and regulatory environments, with tariffs already impacting GM's costs. While GM believes it can offset a portion of the North American tariffs, it is deferring major manufacturing changes until there is more clarity on the levies. Despite strong first-quarter results, GM's profit margins were down due to foreign exchange impacts and increased labor and warranty expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced an expansion of its cost-cutting program, projecting an additional $1.2 billion in savings by the end of 2027, primarily in selling, informational, and administrative expenses. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of declining COVID-19 revenue, despite the company reporting first-quarter profit that exceeded estimates. Pfizer maintained its full-year 2025 outlook, forecasting sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, but noted that this guidance does not account for potential impacts from future tariffs and trade policy changes. The company anticipates a $1 billion sales reduction due to changes in the Medicare program resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the idea of "baby bonuses" to encourage higher birth rates in the US, but the proposal has sparked debate about its underlying motives. While baby bonuses are used in other countries to support new parents, critics worry that embracing them in the US could bolster a political agenda focused on traditional gender roles and reproductive oppression. Democrats and progressive advocates view the discussion as a distraction from the administration's broader agenda, including potential cuts to social safety nets. The real question is whether a one-time payment is a legitimate effort to support families or a symbolic gesture in the face of a sinking reality.</p>

The Jalisco New Generation cartel, designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., operates in the area, contributing to the escalating violence and political instability.

The note, penned by prisoner Franciszek Kempa in 1941, described the violin as a "trial instrument" created with limited tools and materials. Kempa, a skilled violin maker, survived the war and continued his craft in Poland. The violin, now known as the "violin of hope," serves as a testament to the resilience and creativity of prisoners during the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>With President Trump back in office, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to limit the executive branch's power, potentially acting as a check on a chaotic leader. The article argues that justices like Neil Gorsuch, who have historically advocated for a weaker executive branch, could become heroes by upholding traditional conservative principles and rejecting partisan politics. While the Court's Republican majority has often been protective of Trump, there are signs that they may be willing to strike down his tariffs and ensure due process for those facing deportation. The justices, in other words, don’t need to invent a new weapon if they want to destroy the tariffs — they already have one that is tailor-made for this case.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that partisan politics influence Americans' trust in the Federal Reserve, with individuals tending to trust the Fed more when their party's leader is in the White House.

Despite this distrust, Republicans were more likely to believe that inflation will be lower in the future.
