          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the FICO credit score, has announced a new pricing model that allows it to license scores directly to mortgage lenders, bypassing credit bureaus. This move, aimed at eliminating markups, caused FICO's stock to surge over 20%, its largest single-day increase since November. The change is seen as a potential disruption to the business models of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, whose shares fell following the news. Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte praised the move as a creative solution for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two Delta Connection planes, operated by Endeavor Air, were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of a departing flight struck the fuselage and windscreen of an arriving aircraft. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was transported to a hospital, but airport operations were not significantly impacted. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the collision, with preliminary reports suggesting one plane was instructed to hold and yield to the other.</p>

          <p>During the ongoing government shutdown, President Donald Trump has framed the situation as an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut funding for federal agencies and projects he deems Democratic priorities. He announced plans to meet with his budget director to identify potential cuts, which could be temporary or permanent. This follows the administration's recent freeze of billions in funding for infrastructure and climate projects in Democratic-leaning states. The White House has also warned of potential mass firings of federal workers, blaming Democrats for the funding impasse.</p>

          <p>A potential blackout of NBCUniversal channels for nearly 10 million YouTube TV customers has been averted after the two companies reached a new distribution agreement. The previous deal had expired, but talks continued, successfully resolving a dispute over fees and programming terms. A key point of contention was YouTube TV's initial demand to include content from NBC's Peacock streaming service at no extra cost, a proposal NBCUniversal rejected. The resolution ensures popular channels and major sports programming will remain available on the platform.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has publicly stated his belief that Jeffrey Epstein's high-profile associates participated in his criminal behavior and were subsequently blackmailed. Lutnick theorized that Epstein may have traded incriminating videos of these individuals in exchange for the lenient "sweetheart deal" he received in his 2008 state case. This view contrasts with the FBI's official stance that there is no credible information Epstein trafficked victims to others. The claims add another layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the financier's network and the handling of his case.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned under pressure after a disagreement with the Trump administration. The dispute centered on a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to King Charles III as a state gift. Arrington resisted, arguing the artifact was the property of the American people and instead offered to help find a suitable replica. Sources suggest some in the administration were unhappy with his stance, leading to a situation where he was told to "resign — or be fired."</p>

A $90,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now carries an average monthly payment of about $871, down from around $886 in February. While this makes borrowing more affordable, homeowners are advised to proceed with caution, as their home serves as collateral for the loan.

          <p>The global shift toward green energy is creating a high demand for "transition minerals" like lithium and cobalt, but this comes with significant consequences. A new book, "Extraction" by Thea Riofrancos, argues that the mining of these materials often devastates local environments and disproportionately harms Indigenous and poor communities. The process can contaminate water, displace populations, and has been linked to child labor. Riofrancos suggests the perceived paradox of harming the environment to save it is a false choice, advocating instead for systemic changes like improved mass transit to reduce overall mineral demand.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, have been officially identified. Bowden, 29, from North Carolina, was one of over 100 crew members who died aboard the USS California. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades and were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. Using modern DNA analysis, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency successfully made the identification and will re-inter Bowden at Arlington National Cemetery, finally bringing closure to his family.</p>

          <p>Baroness Michelle Mone has accused UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves of using "dangerous and inflammatory" language after a firm linked to her husband was ordered to pay £122 million for breaching a COVID-19 PPE contract. Reeves reportedly joked that the government had a "vendetta" against the peer, which Mone claims has led to threats and risks to her personal safety. A judge recently ruled that the gowns supplied by PPE Medpro did not meet government standards. In a letter to the prime minister, Mone demanded an investigation and a retraction of the comments.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown continues, President Donald Trump has been exceptionally active on social media, using his platform to attack Democrats and frame the crisis to his advantage. His posts have included false claims about healthcare, deepfake videos mocking Democratic leaders, and announcements of his intent to cut programs he considers wasteful. This online strategy mirrors his approach during the 2018-2019 shutdown and reflects his administration's broader combative messaging style. The White House has also used official government websites and email auto-replies to blame Democrats for the shutdown.</p>

Speaking on a recent talk show, Carey described the track as a reinterpretation of one of Jackson's classic songs, expressing her love for it and her disappointment that it isn't on her new album. She believes the estate is saving the song for a larger planned release, possibly connected to the upcoming biopic about the King of Pop.

          <p>An immigration judge has denied a request to reopen the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was wrongly deported earlier this year before being brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges. His lawyers had sought to have his case reopened to allow him to pursue asylum, but the judge declined the bid. Abrego Garcia had previously been granted a withholding of removal, which should have protected him from deportation to El Salvador due to threats from local gangs.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially declared that drug cartels operating in the Caribbean are "unlawful combatants," framing the U.S. as being in a "non-international armed conflict" with them, according to a White House memo. This designation follows recent U.S. military strikes on three boats in the Caribbean that killed 17 people, which the administration claims were carrying members of a Venezuelan drug gang. The move is a significant escalation in the U.S. approach to counter-narcotics, treating cartel members as enemy fighters rather than just criminals and raising legal questions.</p>

          <p>Recent drops in mortgage rates have made large home loans more affordable than they were at the start of the year. For a $700,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment at the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% is approximately $4,351. This represents a savings of about $273 per month compared to January's average rate of 6.93%, which translates to nearly $100,000 in interest savings over the life of the loan.

          <p>A new study has revealed that artificial intelligence can be used to create designs for dangerous biological materials that evade current biosecurity measures. Researchers used AI protein-design tools to "paraphrase" the DNA codes of toxic proteins, creating thousands of variants that retained their hazardous potential but were not flagged by screening software used by DNA synthesis companies. While a fix was quickly developed for the screening software, it isn't perfect, highlighting a growing concern about the potential misuse of AI in creating biothreats.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Science shows that the financial destruction from wildfires has accelerated dramatically, particularly in the last decade, with rising temperatures being a key driver. Researchers analyzed global fire loss data from 1980 to 2023 and found a "step change" in the number of catastrophic fire disasters starting around 2015. Of the 200 most costly fires on record, 43% have occurred in the past ten years. The study highlights that the human and economic impacts of wildfires are growing disproportionately, putting increasing strain on governments and insurance systems. (not investment advice)</p>
