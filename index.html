        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by the water regulator Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder dividends. The penalty includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends," marking the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for such payouts. This action comes as Thames Water grapples with criticism over sewage discharges, leaks, and a Â£20 billion debt, having recently secured a Â£3 billion emergency loan to avoid collapse. The fines are intended to be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, and dividend payments are currently restricted pending Ofwat's approval.</p>

          <p>UFC fighter Paddy Pimblett is aiming for a bout in Abu Dhabi this October, ideally against Ilia Topuria, though a fight with Justin Gaethje is more probable. Pimblett, fresh off a victory over Michael Chandler, is seeking an opponent ranked in the top five, and while he'd prefer to face Topuria, who is scheduled to fight Charles Oliveira, Gaethje is a likely alternative. Pimblett and Topuria have a history of conflict, and Pimblett believes a fight with Gaethje would be exciting and draw significant viewership, bringing him closer to a title shot. Gaethje, known for his knockout power, last fought in March, securing a win over Rafael Fiziev.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space during its ninth test flight but was lost during re-entry due to a propellant leak and subsequent loss of control. The upper-stage vehicle broke up as it fell back into the atmosphere, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean, although the company appears to have resolved issues from previous flights that caused explosions during ascent. The mission aimed to test heat shield variations, but the spinning spacecraft prevented data collection. Elon Musk indicated the next three test flights would occur more rapidly, despite previous delays and challenges with the Starship program, which is slated to be NASA's lunar lander for the Artemis III mission.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the multinational auto conglomerate, has named Antonio Filosa as its new chief executive officer, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa, previously the North American chief operating officer and Jeep CEO, will assume his new role effective June 23, navigating the company through a "pivotal time" in the industry. The appointment follows a period of uncertainty for Stellantis, marked by a decline in first-quarter net revenues and the withdrawal of its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties. John Elkann will continue as executive chairman, supporting Filosa in this next phase of Stellantis' development.</p>

          <p>France's cryptocurrency industry is on edge following a series of violent kidnappings targeting individuals with ties to the crypto world, including family members of entrepreneurs and influencers. These incidents, marked by brazenness and brutality, have prompted crypto leaders to demand changes to European cryptocurrency regulations, which they believe may be enabling hackers to access sensitive personal data. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has announced new safety measures, such as special access to emergency services and security training, and some executives are significantly increasing their personal security spending. Authorities are investigating the attacks as part of a broader trend of organized crime and have made arrests in connection with an attempted kidnapping.</p>

          <p>Antony's impressive performance on loan at Real Betis from Manchester United has led to humorous appeals from the Spanish club's players to retain the Brazilian winger. Betis captain Isco jokingly posted a sinister message on Instagram about kidnapping Antony, and former Betis winger Joaquin joined in, offering to provide a car for the abduction. Since joining in January, Antony has been instrumental in the club's transformation, helping them move from ninth to sixth in La Liga and securing a spot in the Europa League. He also played a key role in leading the team to their first European final, where they will face Chelsea in the Conference League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are growing over Japan's bond market as long-dated yields approach record highs, potentially triggering capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds, impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. Some analysts warn of a potential "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to climb, while others suggest the impact may be a gradual decline rather than a severe shock. The Bank of Japan's scaling back of bond purchases and structural factors in the Japanese life insurance sector contribute to the yield curve steepening. (not investment advice)</p>

Israel, not a party to the negotiations, believes military action is necessary due to Iran's perceived vulnerability, while the US favors a negotiated agreement backed by the threat of force.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European companies operating in China are facing increasing challenges due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of businesses find it harder to operate in the country, marking the fourth consecutive year of deepening corporate pessimism. The proportion of companies planning to expand operations has also fallen to a record low. Despite these challenges, some European companies are increasing their reliance on Chinese components due to lower prices, complicating efforts to shield manufacturing from China's exports.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth test flight, despite successfully reaching orbit. An apparent propellant leak caused a loss of attitude control, leading to an uncontrolled re-entry and likely disintegration over the Indian Ocean. This mission aimed to build on previous flight tests, but the failure highlights the challenges in developing a fully reusable spacecraft. Elon Musk reaffirmed the company's commitment to making life multiplanetary, and stated that the data gathered will improve Starship's reliability for future missions.</p>
