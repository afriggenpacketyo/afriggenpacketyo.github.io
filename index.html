          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been dismissed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency before his promotion. His ousting follows a March incident where sensitive military plans regarding an attack on Yemen's Houthis were shared in a private messaging app chat involving Hegseth and other top administration officials. The Pentagon confirmed his departure and thanked him for his service, though the specific reasons for the firing were not officially disclosed.</p>

          <p>A driver deliberately rammed a car into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood, Los Angeles, injuring at least 30 people, with several remaining in critical condition. The incident occurred after the individual was removed from a nearby business, allegedly making a U-turn before accelerating into the crowd. After the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which an unknown male shot the driver. The driver is in custody and will face assault charges, while police are actively searching for the shooter.</p>

          <p>Violent sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouins have continued in Syria's Suweida Province, resulting in over 900 reported deaths. The violence persists despite an "immediate ceasefire" announced by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose deployed troops have been accused of siding against the Druze. Israel has intervened by striking Syrian government forces to protect the Druze, a minority group with ties to communities in Israel. Despite a US-brokered pact, reports of gunfire and looting continued in Suweida city, casting doubt on the ceasefire's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler has established a commanding four-shot lead at The Open Championship, making his victory seem almost certain heading into the final round. His performance is described as relentless and unflappable, drawing comparisons to the dominance of Tiger Woods, with bookmakers giving him extremely short odds to win. Having won on the last nine occasions he held a 54-hole lead, his consistent and simple approach to the game leaves competitors with little hope. This potential victory would mark his fourth major title and move him three-quarters of the way to a career grand slam.</p>

This shift, marked by a comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement, or even one day replace, the US security guarantee for Europe. This strategic realignment aims to bolster European defense independence, though officials acknowledge that full independence from the US is not yet realistic.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona after falling out of favor at Old Trafford under manager Ruben Amorim. Despite a lackluster period at United and an inconsistent loan spell at Aston Villa, Barcelona sees potential in the 27-year-old to strengthen their forward line. The deal is financially attractive for the Spanish club, as an initial loan with an option to buy presents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a player with vast top-level experience. For Manchester United, the move represents an effort to offload an unwanted player and reshape the squad.</p>

The plot, known as "Operation Valkyrie," involved planting a bomb in Hitler's Wolf's Lair headquarters, but it failed to kill the dictator, leading to the swift execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While the plotters were initially viewed as traitors, they are now largely honored as heroes in Germany.

          <p>A community fundraiser has raised over £23,000 to support families affected by a tragic coach crash in Somerset, UK, that killed a 10-year-old boy. The coach, carrying pupils from Minehead Middle School on a trip, flipped over, leaving six other children and three adults hospitalized. The fundraiser was started by a local resident to provide urgent financial and psychological support to those impacted by the incident. The community has been devastated by the tragedy, with many leaving tributes at the school, which was closed the day after the crash.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's inconsistent enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open. Both golfers were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after Shane Lowry received a controversial penalty. Stenson expressed frustration that after rounds took an hour over the allotted time on day one, officials were suddenly concerned about being a few minutes behind schedule. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing the current approach is unfair and that officials are hesitant to expose slower players.</p>

          <p>According to Gazan hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food from aid distribution centers, killing 32 people. The incidents occurred near hubs run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by the U.S. and Israel. Witnesses reported indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after suspects approached its forces. The GHF, which aims to replace the U.N. aid system, denied any deadly shootings occurred at its sites, claiming the incidents happened far away.</p>

          <p>A feature in The Guardian explores the work of Generation Life, a group of Gen Z activists who advocate for chastity before marriage. The article follows them as they engage with young people at the Jersey shore, a location known for its party culture. Rather than focusing solely on abstinence, the group defines chastity as seeing a person's full worth and resisting the objectification prevalent on social media. This countercultural message aims to resonate with a generation that is famously risk-averse and feels the negative mental health impacts of online life, reframing caution as a celebrated virtue.</p>

          <p>A CNBC profile features Ashley Kaye, a 36-year-old who lives and travels full-time in a customized Toyota Tacoma truck. After quitting her job in 2020, she embarked on an overlanding adventure along the Pan-American highway, spending approximately $1,305 per month on expenses like gas and food. Kaye invested over $50,000 to renovate the truck with a camper, solar power, and other amenities for self-reliant travel. While she enjoys the freedom of setting her own pace, she acknowledges the logistical challenges of crossing borders and the constant work of setting up and breaking down her mobile home.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upcoming House of Councilors election, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment. These parties are using rhetoric similar to Donald Trump's MAGA movement, blaming foreigners for social issues and crime, despite data showing a decrease in arrests of foreign nationals. This nationalist push comes as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's popularity is declining, and the country grapples with the economic benefits of tourism versus local resentment over unruly visitor behavior. The far-right advocates for relying on Japanese capabilities rather than foreign labor. (not investment advice)</p>

Graham was shot in the chest and killed at a music festival in a west London park in July 2024. The newly released footage shows the suspect entering the park and later leaving, then chasing a second individual down the street while holding a gun. Police believe people in the community know the identity of the person responsible and are urging them to come forward.

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the building collapse in George that killed 34 construction workers last year was "entirely preventable." The investigation revealed that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for months. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest before the five-story apartment block collapsed, but work continued. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and victims' families continue to face trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>On "The Ramsey Show," a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice on a car loan, revealing that despite a $156,000 household income, they struggle to afford groceries. She disclosed that her husband spends up to $700 a month on tobacco and marijuana, which she described as an addiction. Host Dave Ramsey challenged her, stating that if her husband is truly an addict, she must act accordingly by controlling finances, rather than treating his spending as a budget item. Ramsey questioned the narrative that they couldn't afford food, suggesting the core issue was addiction and control, not just budgeting.</p>

Doctors told him he was a "millisecond" away from a much more severe, surgery-requiring injury.

The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification occurred after American runner Antonio Pettigrew confessed in 2008 to doping during that period. The belated ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where the athletes received a warm reception from the home crowd.</p>

The move, which Brazil's President Lula da Silva condemned as unacceptable interference, is the latest action by the Trump administration to support Bolsonaro, who claims he is a victim of political persecution. The sanctions follow a ruling that Bolsonaro must wear an electronic monitor as he awaits a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election, a case that has strained U.S.-Brazil relations.</p>
