          <h2>Student Loan Collections Resume, Raising Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 08:52:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to resume collections on defaulted student loans from millions of borrowers is raising concerns among experts about a potential economic slowdown. Starting next month, roughly 5 million borrowers will face collections, including wage garnishments, potentially reducing consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity. While some experts downplay the overall economic impact, others warn that it could exacerbate existing economic uncertainties and damage borrowers' credit scores, making it harder to secure loans for major purchases. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that taxpayers should not be responsible for irresponsible student loan policies, while others suggest this action provides clarity after years of uncertainty.

          <p>A large wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, prompted acting Governor Tahesha Way to declare a state of emergency, leading to mandatory evacuations for 3,000 residents in Ocean and Lacey townships. The Jones Road Wildfire, which started in the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, has burned through 8,500 acres and was only 10% contained as of Tuesday night. While evacuation orders have been lifted and major roads reopened, approximately 25,000 homes and businesses experienced power outages as a precautionary measure. Fire officials continue to battle the blaze, utilizing fire engines, bulldozers, and backfiring operations to establish containment lines, and no injuries have been reported.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price is surging for the third consecutive day, nearing $95,000, driven by a broad market relief rally following President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and less aggressive rhetoric towards Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency has recovered more than half of its losses since Inauguration Day and is approaching the flat line for the year. Analysts suggest this rally reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in Bitcoin, recognizing its value as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing has exceeded expectations, adding pressure on public finances as Chancellor Rachel Reeves seeks a trade deal with the US to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Borrowing reached £151.9bn in the year to March, increasing £20.7bn from the previous year, prompting concerns about potential spending cuts or tax increases to meet borrowing rules. The IMF has also lowered its growth forecast for the UK in 2025, citing tariffs and rising inflation. Despite increased tax revenue, government debt remains high, and the cost of borrowing is creating a challenging environment.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies is driving increased demand for data centers, leading to concerns about growing energy consumption. While computing and storing data currently account for a relatively small percentage of global electricity demand, the rapid expansion of AI is injecting uncertainty into energy forecasts. However, computers are becoming more efficient, and AI tools have the potential to optimize energy distribution and design better batteries. Despite the near-term energy spikes, there are paths to align AI's expansion with climate change goals through efficiency improvements, clean energy deployment, and supply chain decarbonization.</p>

          <p>The European Union has fined Apple and Meta nearly $800 million for breaching the bloc's digital competition laws, specifically the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple was fined 500 million euros for failing to comply with obligations regarding alternative offers outside its App Store. Meta received a 200 million euro fine over data handling practices. Apple plans to appeal the EU fine, claiming the European Commission is unfairly targeting them. The EU has said that the tech giant was ordered to remove technical and commercial restrictions on steering.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that William Shakespeare's relationship with his wife, Anne Hathaway, may have been more affectionate than previously believed. An examination of a letter fragment addressed to "good Mrs Shakespeare" indicates they lived together in central London between 1600 and 1610. The letter, preserved in the binding of a book, implies that Anne stood by her husband during a dispute over money. The finding challenges the long-held belief that Shakespeare abandoned his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon and felt bitterness towards her.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Beradt, a German Jewish journalist, documented the dreams of individuals living under Nazi rule, revealing the psychological impact of authoritarianism. Her book, The Third Reich of Dreams, explores how the regime's influence permeated even the subconscious minds of its citizens. Beradt interpreted these dreams as attempts to make sense of a reality filled with propaganda and fear. While some dreams reflected resistance, others exposed a disturbing desire to conform, highlighting the burden of freedom and the relief found in unfreedom.</p>

          <p>Two documentaries, Kiss the Ground and Common Ground, promote regenerative agriculture as a solution to reverse climate change and fix problems within the modern food system. While regenerative agriculture practices can improve soil health and offer environmental benefits, the films oversimplify the complexities and tradeoffs of agricultural production. Critics argue the claims are overly optimistic and scientifically dubious, and that the approach requires more land and may not sequester carbon effectively. A more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, according to experts, is to reduce meat and dairy production.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the US has grown increasingly punitive, with lawmakers introducing legislation that would treat fetuses as people and potentially charge women who have abortions with homicide. This shift is attributed to the movement's alliance with the Republican party and the rise of "abortion abolitionists" who believe women should be punished for having abortions. Despite the unpopularity of such measures, the movement is focusing on convincing judges to recognize fetal personhood under the 14th amendment, bypassing popular will and democratic norms.</p>
