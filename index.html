        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs across 20 federal agencies, following a lawsuit from federal employee unions. The ruling prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave in order to comply with an executive order to reduce costs, spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency. The judge stated that the administration likely needs Congressional approval to implement such significant changes, providing a temporary reprieve for federal employees and challenging the executive branch's authority. This CBS News article underscores the legal battles surrounding the administration's efforts to reorganize and downsize the federal government.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing legislation to prevent hostile foreign powers, such as China, Iran, and Russia, from purchasing land within the state that could pose a national security threat.

The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate and reverse land deals that pose risks to public health or safety, with exemptions for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the UK, driven by generous tax incentives and lower labor costs.
