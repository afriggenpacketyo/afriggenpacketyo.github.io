          <p>A 41-year-old climber, Alex Chiu, died after falling approximately 3,000 feet on Mount McKinley (Denali) in Alaska's Denali National Park. Chiu was ascending the West Buttress climbing route with two companions when the incident occurred at a location known as Squirrel Point. High winds and snow hampered rescue efforts, delaying the recovery of Chiu's body until Wednesday morning. The National Parks Service reports that there are currently 500 climbers on Mount McKinley, with the climbing season running from early May to early July, and this section of the route has seen multiple fatal falls since 1980. The tragic event serves as a somber reminder of the inherent risks associated with mountaineering. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's presidential actions, alleging that Biden's aides masked his cognitive decline. The inquiry will scrutinize Biden's executive actions, including pardons and federal rules issued near the end of his term. Trump's memo targets Biden's use of an autopen and claims a cover-up of who truly wielded executive power. Democrats dismiss the investigation as a distraction, while Republicans seek testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. The investigation is being led by Pam Bondi and David Warrington. </p>

          <p>Thousands of Job Corps students face uncertainty as the Trump administration seeks to shut down contractor-operated centers nationwide. The Labor Department cited poor outcomes and serious incident reports as justification for the "phased pause" in operations.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order prevents the removal of Soliman's family, who are Egyptian citizens, pending a hearing on June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives is unlawful and violates democratic justice principles. The family entered the United States in August 2022 and were allowed to remain until February 2023, with Soliman applying for asylum in September 2022. </p>

Trump justified the move by claiming Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has entanglements with foreign countries, and has discriminated in their admissions practices.

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels to be deconstructed on the mainland. The agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. The cleanup is especially important to the Squaxin Island Tribe, as the island is of particular cultural significance to them. </p>

Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlight the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as a critical feature in bird evolution.

The findings suggest that early microbial colonization plays a crucial role in immune system development and could lead to therapies that boost beneficial bacteria in babies. </p>

          <p>A man carjacked an L.A. County Sheriffâ€™s Department bucket truck in downtown L.A., while two deputies were in the vehicle, one of whom was in the elevated bucket. The suspect claimed he needed to go to the hospital and drove away, causing the deputies to jump from the moving vehicle. One deputy sustained minor injuries during a struggle with the suspect. The vehicle was later recovered in Gardena, and the Sheriffâ€™s Department is searching for the suspect. </p>
