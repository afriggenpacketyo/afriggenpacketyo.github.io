          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Parental "Lies" That May Hinder a Child's Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over 20 years of experience outlines six common but potentially harmful statements parents make to their children, such as "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything." The article argues that while well-intentioned, these phrases can create unrealistic expectations, invalidate a child's feelings, and discourage them from seeking help. Instead, the expert suggests fostering resilience by redefining success, acknowledging difficult emotions, and teaching the difference between harmful dishonesty and acceptable white lies. The advice aims to help parents raise emotionally healthy and successful children by replacing these common fibs with more balanced messages.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Reports Reduced Losses and Increased Revenue in Second Quarter of 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:06:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing announced a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, reporting a loss of $176 million compared to $1.09 billion a year prior, as revenue climbed 35% to $22.75 billion. The improvements are attributed to the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018, signaling a potential recovery for the embattled manufacturer. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," although the company still faces challenges, including production limits and delayed certifications for its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models. The positive results come despite a $445 million charge related to a Justice Department settlement over two fatal 737 Max crashes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UnitedHealth Group has revised its 2025 financial outlook downward, falling short of Wall Street expectations due to persistently high medical costs, causing its stock to drop. The company now projects adjusted earnings of at least $16 per share, significantly lower than the anticipated $20.91, citing increased use of healthcare services by seniors in Medicare Advantage plans. This trend, which began post-pandemic, includes more physician visits and outpatient care, which has strained the insurer's profitability. The announcement marks the first earnings report under new CEO Stephen Hemsley, who is tasked with restoring investor confidence amid these financial pressures and ongoing DOJ investigations.

          <p>Karl Schlögel, a German historian specializing in Eastern Europe, has been awarded the 2025 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade for his insightful work on Russia and Ukraine. The prize jury highlighted Schlögel as one of the first to warn against Vladimir Putin's expansionist policies and for his continued advocacy for Ukraine's place in Europe. His research, which refocused on Ukraine following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, is praised for correcting prejudices and making history vivid and accessible. Schlögel stated the award is a great honor and emphasized that Germany must prepare to defend Ukraine, asserting that "Russia is the enemy."</p>

          <p>The cleanup of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has encountered another significant setback, with operator TEPCO announcing a multi-year delay for the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris. The process for the No. 3 reactor is now not expected to begin until 2037 or later, pushing back the overall decommissioning timeline which was targeted for 2051. Approximately 800 tons of hazardous melted fuel mixed with debris remain inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns during the 2011 tsunami. Despite this latest delay, which follows a three-year setback in retrieving even a small sample, TEPCO maintains it will stick to the original 2051 completion goal.</p>

In a detailed article, Xu argues that Dalio's recommendation for China to deleverage is misguided and misjudges the country's debt dynamics. Xu asserts that China's recent liquidity issues stem not from excessive borrowing but from overly aggressive deleveraging policies that have negatively impacted the macro economy. This public debate highlights the differing perspectives on the appropriate fiscal path for the world's second-largest economy as it navigates its significant debt challenges.

          <p>Mortgage experts anticipate that home loan rates will likely remain stable in the high 6% range through August, as the Federal Reserve continues its cautious approach to inflation. The central bank is hesitant to lower its benchmark rate due to concerns about stoking inflation, particularly with uncertainty surrounding the administration's tariff policies. While many analysts do not expect a rate cut this month, there is growing speculation that a reduction could occur at the Fed's September meeting. For prospective homebuyers, this means that waiting for lower rates is a gamble, as a future rate drop could also increase buyer competition and home prices. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three successful strategies for maintaining productivity. The first involves implementing "productivity hacks," primarily by reducing the number and length of meetings and protecting focused work time. The second strategy is process engineering, where employees are empowered to make their tasks more efficient, a method particularly effective in manufacturing settings. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects, allowing them to reallocate time to more strategic goals. These changes have led to higher profits and lower employee turnover.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is launching a new initiative called "Green Apron Service" as part of a broader strategy to boost sales by focusing on customer experience and hospitality. The program, which involves new barista training and operational changes, aims to create more warm and engaging interactions in its cafes. This move is supported by investments in technology like "Smart Queue" to ensure proper staffing and faster service times, particularly as digital orders now constitute over 30% of sales. The strategy, spearheaded by new COO Mike Grams, is a core component of CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" plan to revitalize the brand amid lackluster sales.</p>

He also noted that pharmaceuticals were a key component of the EU deal, with a 15% tariff, ahead of a forthcoming U.S. pharmaceutical policy that is expected to be "higher."

          <p>An NHS England report has identified "significant" concerns regarding the safety and quality of maternity services at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, prompting horrified reactions from bereaved parents. The investigation found issues with staffing, a "challenging" culture, and a failure to learn from past incidents, leading to 101 recommendations for urgent improvement. The findings follow a BBC investigation that spoke with dozens of families who experienced inadequate care, including avoidable injury or death of their babies. In response, the trust apologized to families and stated that implementing urgent improvements is a priority, while its CEO announced his retirement.</p>

          <p>Gee-Kung Chang, a renowned Georgia Institute of Technology professor and a pioneer in 5G/6G network technology, has been fully exonerated after a four-year legal ordeal. In 2021, he was arrested at his home by federal agents as part of the U.S. government's "China Initiative," which targeted academics with alleged ties to China. After years of fighting the charges, a judge dismissed nine wire fraud counts for lack of evidence in 2024, and the final visa fraud charge was dropped this April. The case highlights the personal and professional devastation faced by scientists targeted by the now-discontinued program.</p>

          <p>Five women who were victims of the Rotherham grooming gangs have alleged they were also sexually abused by on-duty police officers during the same period. One woman claims a South Yorkshire Police officer repeatedly sexually assaulted her in a police car from the age of 12. These new allegations are part of testimony from 30 victims detailing police corruption and misconduct, which has prompted a new criminal investigation. The original inquiry's leader, Professor Alexis Jay, has expressed shock that the force is investigating its own former officers, calling for an independent body to handle the case to avoid conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Nabarun Dasgupta, a prominent epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, was driven to study street drugs and overdose data after the death of his close friend two decades ago. His work, which includes analyzing the drug supply to provide real-time information to users, has become a vital resource in understanding the overdose crisis. Dasgupta expressed immense relief over recent data showing a 27% drop in overdose deaths from 2023 to 2024, the first significant decline in years. He attributes the drop to a less deadly drug supply and better access to treatment and naloxone, feeling for the first time that efforts are headed in the right direction.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are tied with 24% of respondents' support each, closely followed by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett at 22%. The survey of 37 economists, fund managers, and strategists also indicates that 42% believe President Trump's public pressure on the Fed makes interest rate cuts less likely.

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk plunged as much as 26% after the Danish pharmaceutical company announced a new CEO and significantly cut its full-year financial guidance. The company cited weaker-than-expected U.S. sales growth for its blockbuster obesity drug Wegovy, due to competition from compounded versions and a slower market expansion. Company veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar will take over as CEO, tasked with navigating the firm through these challenges. The lowered outlook marks the second time this year the Wegovy maker has downgraded its forecast, shaking investor confidence in one of its key products. (not investment advice)</p>
