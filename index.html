        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent peace talks in Istanbul and a prisoner swap agreement, Russia and Ukraine remain significantly divided on key issues, including territorial control and military limitations. Russia demands Ukraine withdraw from annexed eastern regions and limit its military, while Ukraine seeks an immediate cease-fire and restoration of its territorial integrity. President Trump plans to speak with Presidents Putin and Zelensky, hoping to broker a cease-fire. The United States remains open to mechanisms that could foster lasting peace, though Russia's continued demands raise doubts about Putin's genuine willingness to end the conflict. </p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, leading to the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, which was on a goodwill tour, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge, causing significant damage to its masts and rigging. The incident prompted a brief closure of the bridge and a full investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The ship was supposed to head south and sail out of New York Harbor, with a stop on the Brooklyn waterfront to refuel before heading onward to Iceland. </p>

          <p>Conan O’Brien and Ryan Reynolds humorously compared Meghan Markle’s new lifestyle brand, As Ever, and its artisanal jam offerings to Reynolds' late father's job as a food broker. The comedians joked about the Duchess of Sussex's $14 raspberry jam, which is crafted with a hint of lemon and packaged in elegant Keepsake Packaging. This commentary follows criticism of Markle's venture as inauthentic, with experts noting the importance of relatability and connection in building a successful lifestyle brand.

          <p>Despite its growing economic and diplomatic influence, India continues to grapple with its long-standing conflict with Pakistan. Recent military clashes have highlighted India's limitations in resolving the 78-year-old dispute, particularly given the nuclear arsenals of both countries. The situation is further complicated by increasing superpower involvement, with the United States supporting India and China backing Pakistan. Religious nationalism in both countries has also hardened views, making conciliation difficult and perpetuating a cycle of conflict. </p>

It discusses his advocacy for self-confidence and fighting for rights "by any means necessary," including violence if needed, in response to the oppression faced by African Americans. The article highlights his early life marked by racism and violence, his involvement with the Nation of Islam, and his later shift away from racial separatism after a pilgrimage to Mecca.

          <p>A new study reveals that altering the way bricks are stacked in kilns in Bangladesh could drastically reduce air pollution. By implementing a zig-zag pattern that improves airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, kilns can operate more efficiently. The study found that these simple interventions reduced fuel use by 23% and decreased carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions by approximately 20%. This low-cost solution not only benefits the environment but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners. </p>

While acknowledging the need to consider future legal adaptations, the piece suggests that Hong Kong should not prematurely abandon its existing legal structures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of night trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns. In contrast, the United States is cutting funding for public infrastructure, leading to a binary choice between fast, environmentally damaging options and slow, run-down alternatives. Richards advocates for investing in rail networks to promote community, connection, and a more sustainable future. </p>

Years later, DNA evidence led them to Jerry Westrom, a local businessman, and father. Despite the DNA match, the case hinged on whether the footprints belonged to Westrom, a question that divided forensic experts and ultimately led to his conviction. </p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing. Projects like Nairobi’s mega-highway and Zambia’s Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting this model.
