          <p>Intel's share price fell after former President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. Trump's statement on Truth Social cited unspecified conflicts of interest, adding to pressure already on Tan from Senator Tom Cotton regarding his past business ties to Chinese companies. The call for resignation comes as Intel navigates financial challenges, including recent spending cuts and the cancellation of planned factory projects in Europe, despite beating second-quarter earnings expectations. The company is also facing scrutiny over its role as a recipient of U.S. taxpayer funds for national security-related chip manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate to 4%, marking the lowest point since March 2023. This decision directly affects household finances, with variable-rate mortgage holders likely to see reduced monthly payments, though the benefit is less clear for those on fixed-rate deals. Conversely, savers will face lower returns on their accounts as interest rates on savings are expected to continue their downward trend. The central bank made this move despite inflation remaining above its 2% target, balancing the need to control prices with concerns about a cooling jobs market and slowing economic growth.

          <p>A recent tragedy where at least 92 migrants, mostly from Ethiopia, drowned in the Bab al-Mandab Strait underscores the extreme dangers of the "Eastern Route" to the Gulf states. Despite the risks, including perilous sea conditions and abuse by smugglers, the number of people attempting this crossing has increased significantly in the last year. Migrants often travel on overcrowded, unsafe fishing boats and face the added threat of being thrown overboard by smugglers. The lack of an official sea rescue program, combined with commercial ships' hesitancy to help due to piracy fears, leaves those in distress with little hope of being saved.</p>

This contradicts a statement from another member of Combs' legal team who suggested such conversations had occurred. Agnifilo clarified that his focus is on securing a favorable sentence for Combs, who was convicted on two prostitution-related charges and is currently jailed while awaiting his October 3rd sentencing. Combs was acquitted of more serious charges, including sex trafficking, but faces a potential maximum sentence of 10 years for each conviction.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to order the Commerce Department to conduct a new U.S. census that would explicitly exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated the new tally would be based on "modern day facts and figures" and information from the 2024 presidential election. This move revives a policy objective from his first term, during which he unsuccessfully attempted to add a citizenship question to the census form. The plan represents a significant shift in how the U.S. population is officially counted for purposes of representation and federal funding.</p>

The proposed complex at Royal Mint Court has raised national security concerns, including fears of espionage due to its proximity to the city's financial district and its fiber optic data cables. Local residents and pro-democracy activists also worry about potential security risks and harassment of political opponents. The government has taken control of the planning decision from the local council, with a final verdict expected by September 9th amid ongoing diplomatic engagement with Beijing.</p>

          <p>Flash flooding in North Carolina resulted in the deaths of two people near Spring Hope after their car was swept away by floodwaters. The region experienced 4 to 6 inches of rain, leading to a "considerable" flash flood warning. This event contrasts with weather in the western U.S., where seven states are under critical fire weather alerts due to conditions conducive to rapid wildfire spread. Meanwhile, extreme heat warnings persist in the Southwest, with temperatures potentially reaching 118 degrees, and a severe storm threat, including possible tornadoes, is forecast for the Upper Midwest.</p>

However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, though this was an improvement from the previous quarter. Burger King's U.S. turnaround efforts showed modest progress with a 1.5% sales increase as restaurant renovations continue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite plans for a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, significant obstacles suggest a rapid resolution to the war in Ukraine is unlikely. Russia's core demands, including sovereignty over five Ukrainian regions and Ukraine's complete demilitarization, remain maximalist and are fundamentally unacceptable to Kyiv. Analysts suggest Putin may be engaging in talks to fend off new U.S. sanctions or to persuade Trump of Russia's position, given Trump's past reluctance to condemn the Russian leader. The vast gulf between Moscow's and Kyiv's positions means that even direct presidential intervention may fail to bridge the divide, especially if Ukraine is not directly involved in the negotiations.</p>

The article delves into the statistical and psychological impact of sibling loss, which is associated with higher mortality risk and mental health issues for the bereaved. It highlights how these relationships are our longest-lasting bonds, and their absence creates a unique void in one's past, present, and future.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis argues that the famine conditions in Gaza are not an accidental byproduct of war but a deliberate and sustained policy by Israel. The article cites statements from Israeli officials at the conflict's outset promising a "complete siege" and highlights how the systematic blocking of humanitarian aid has led to widespread malnutrition and death. Unlike historical famines complicated by natural factors, the situation in Gaza is described as entirely human-made, with Israel having the capacity to allow aid but choosing not to. This use of starvation as a weapon of war is illegal under international law and has led to war crime indictments from the International Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which is expected to take place "in the coming days." The announcement followed a visit to Moscow by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Trump described as "highly productive." While a specific date and location have not been released, a Putin adviser stated that work on the summit has begun. The meeting comes ahead of Trump's August 8th deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or face the threat of severe secondary sanctions on its fossil fuel exports.</p>

          <p>German prosecutors have confirmed that a body discovered in the Westerwald region is that of the man suspected of killing three people in the town of Weitefeld in April. The discovery ends a large-scale manhunt that began after the suspect disappeared following the crime. The victims, a husband and wife and their 16-year-old son, were found in their home with fatal injuries from both a firearm and a stabbing weapon. The suspect's body was in an advanced state of decomposition, and a weapon that could be the murder weapon was found nearby, though a cause of death has not yet been identified.</p>

          <p>In a controversial development, South African prosecutors have withdrawn murder charges against Adrian de Wet, one of three men accused of killing two women and feeding their bodies to pigs. De Wet will now serve as a state witness in the trial against farm owner Zachariah Johannes Olivier and another farm worker, William Musora. De Wet's lawyer claims he was forced under duress to dispose of the bodies after Olivier shot and killed the two women. The case has heightened racial tensions in South Africa, and the victim's family expressed dismay that one of the accused will not face justice.</p>

          <p>United Airlines has lifted a nationwide ground stop that caused extensive delays for hours at major hubs, including Chicago O'Hare, Denver, and Newark. The airline attributed the disruption to an internal "technology issue" and confirmed it was not related to cybersecurity or the broader air traffic control system. While the underlying problem has been resolved, the company expects residual delays as it works to restore normal operations. United stated it is treating the event as a preventable delay, meaning it will cover customer expenses such as hotels where applicable.</p>

          <p>The well-preserved body of Nasiruddin, a man who went missing in 1997 at the age of 31, has been discovered on a melting glacier in Pakistan's Kohistan region. He reportedly fell into a crevasse while fleeing a village dispute with his brother, who survived. His body, still carrying an identity card, was found by a local shepherd near the shrinking Lady Meadows glacier and has since been buried by his family, who expressed relief at the recovery. This discovery is part of a global trend where receding glaciers are increasingly revealing the remains of climbers and hikers who disappeared decades ago.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is looking to acquire two Tesla Cybertrucks for use in "live missile fire testing," according to government contracting documents. The justification for the purchase states that the vehicles are "likely" to be used by adversaries on the battlefield due to their durable stainless-steel construction. The document notes that the trucks do not sustain the expected level of damage from major impacts, making them valuable for munitions testing. This procurement reflects a military interest in understanding the resilience of new commercial technologies that could appear in future operational theaters.</p>

The "one in, one out" pilot scheme, which just came into force, allows the UK to return a migrant who crosses illegally in exchange for accepting an approved asylum seeker from France. The detained individuals will be held in immigration removal centers until they are sent back, a process the Home Office says could happen within weeks. The government stated it will robustly defend against any legal challenges, asserting that France is a safe country for returns.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing a standoff with Jingye, the Chinese owners of British Steel, who are reportedly demanding hundreds of millions of pounds to complete the transfer of the company. The government took control of the Scunthorpe steelworks in April to prevent the closure of its blast furnaces but stopped short of full nationalization. Negotiations for a new buyer have stalled over this financial demand, as the government and Jingye have vastly different valuations of the loss-making company. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is expected to join the talks in September to resolve the impasse and secure a sustainable future for the site.</p>

          <p>A cultural analysis explores the history and psychology of survivalism, from its far-right origins in the 1970s to its modern-day boom among tech billionaires and online communities. The article distinguishes between the temporary condition of a "survivor" trying to reconnect with civilization and the permanent identity of a "survivalist" who often craves societal collapse. Drawing on fiction from "Lord of the Flies" to "The Road," it examines how these stories often present a bleak, Hobbesian view of humanity. However, the article contrasts this with real-world disaster studies showing that mutual aid, not brutal individualism, is often the dominant human response in a crisis.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats are raising alarms over reports that the Trump administration plans to divert funds from the Sentinel nuclear missile program to pay for a $1 billion retrofit of a gifted jet. The luxury Boeing 747-8 was given to President Trump by Qatar's royal family, and converting it to meet Air Force One security standards will come at a high cost to taxpayers. In a letter to the Air Force secretary, senators and representatives questioned the funding shift, warning it could risk further delays to the already over-budget nuclear modernization program. They also criticized the lack of transparency and suggested the gift itself raises ethical concerns.</p>

In exchange for restoring frozen federal funding, the universities have adopted measures that critics warn severely undermine their independence and academic freedom. Advocates fear these deals will embolden the administration to use coercive tactics and the "weaponization of federal funds" to enforce ideological conformity on other institutions. The settlements come amid a broader campaign of cuts and investigations targeting universities that the administration has described as hostile.</p>
