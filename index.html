          <p>The Trump administration has deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations. Demonstrations, which began Friday evening, continued through the weekend, halting traffic on the 101 Freeway, leading police to deem it an unlawful assembly. President Trump signed a memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the perceived "lawlessness" in California. Governor Gavin Newsom has requested the deployment be rescinded, calling the move "purposefully inflammatory" and likely to escalate tensions. The article conveys the tense atmosphere surrounding immigration enforcement and the political conflict between the federal and state governments. </p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets across the seafloor, across English waters. The proposal would expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where concerns about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life have been raised. President Macron has called for a moratorium on deep sea mining, highlighting the importance of protecting the ocean as a shared resource. </p>

          <p>Health experts discuss the importance of magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 enzyme systems, and the potential risks of deficiency. Magnesium supports energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation, and may help lower the risk of certain diseases. Symptoms of deficiency include insomnia, muscle cramps, fatigue, and heart arrhythmias, and can be caused by certain medical conditions, medications, or poor diet. While dietary sources like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are best, supplements may be recommended in certain cases of deficiency or health conditions. </p>

          <p>In Kentucky's Pike County, residents are worried about the departure of young people seeking jobs in cities and the opioid epidemic affecting those who remain. Roger Ford, president of an energy startup, notes the lack of immigration to replace the native-born population. The region, once a stronghold of New Deal Democrats, has suffered from the closure of coal mines and the rise of drug addiction. Many residents feel that modern Democrats do not address their concerns, leading to strong support for Donald Trump, who received 81% of the vote in the area in the 2024 election. </p>

          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining popularity among non-diabetics, with companies claiming they can revolutionize health by tracking blood sugar levels. These devices, which involve wearing a small patch that sends glucose readings to a phone app, have proven beneficial for people with diabetes. However, studies on their effectiveness for non-diabetics are mixed, with some showing limited weight loss benefits compared to standard diets. While CGMs may help individuals identify carbohydrate sensitivities, motivate healthier eating, and increase dietary awareness, experts caution that the data can be confusing, misleading, and may not always provide a complete picture of metabolic health. </p>

Experts worry that this trend could upset the constitutional balance of power, potentially granting the president unchecked authority. While the White House defends the use of these powers as necessary to address inherited crises, critics argue that many declarations do not constitute genuine emergencies and should be addressed through congressional legislation. The debate centers on the definition of an "emergency" and the extent to which a president can bypass Congress to implement their agenda. </p>

          <p>The federal government has collected $68.9 billion in tariffs and excise taxes in the first five months of the year, a 78% increase from the previous year. While the Trump administration touts this as a benefit, the tariffs are primarily paid by American businesses and families, increasing costs for importers and consumers. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the tariffs could reduce the federal debt by $2.8 trillion over a decade, but they will also lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. The tariffs also create cash flow challenges for businesses and uncertainty in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase the number of regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to maintain a safe and reliable supply.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has not yet reached an agreement with the Treasury on her department's budget before Wednesday's Spending Review. Despite an offer of above-inflation increases to police funding for the next three years, Cooper is the sole remaining cabinet minister without a settled budget. The Home Office argues that current spending proposals would not allow them to maintain police numbers, which are necessary to deliver policy commitments on neighborhood policing. Meanwhile, heads of police organizations have warned that the police service is "broken" due to budget cuts. </p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the Reserve Bank of India's large rate cut could negatively impact the rupee by pressuring foreign exchange forward premiums. The rupee has underperformed its Asian counterparts in 2025 amid weak capital flows. A narrowing interest rate differential between the U.S. and India could lead to further depreciation of the Indian currency. Falling premiums make the rupee less attractive for carry trades and diminishes the incentive for exporters to hedge future receivables. (not investment advice)</p>
