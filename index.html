          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 00:07:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's manufacturing activity has contracted for the fourth straight month, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 49.3 in July, below analysts' expectations. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including extreme weather events like heatwaves and heavy rains, ongoing trade tensions with the United States, and a broader economic slowdown. Sub-indexes for employment, new orders, and raw materials also indicated contraction, signaling worrying economic conditions ahead. Experts note that the tariff impact on China's economy is expected to become more apparent from August onwards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25% tariffs and an unspecified penalty on India, but New Delhi has not rushed to secure a trade agreement. India is strategically resisting U.S. demands for greater market access, particularly for agricultural products, to protect its large and politically significant farming sector. Analysts believe India can withstand the pressure because its exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy, and it is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy by strengthening trade ties with other partners like the U.K. and the EU. This diversification provides India with leverage in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats are vehemently opposing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, arguing it is a blatant gerrymander designed to dilute the voting power of minority communities. The draft plan would make five currently Democratic-held U.S. House districts more favorable to the GOP, a move encouraged by former President Trump. Critics, including Democratic members of Congress, have labeled the map "grossly unfair" and a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act, warning it could set a dangerous precedent for partisan redistricting nationwide. The plan must still pass the GOP-controlled state legislature.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in California's Fresno County on Wednesday evening, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was not injured. The aircraft was attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders," a Navy squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore that trains pilots on the F-35 platform. The crash caused a small grass fire that burned approximately a dozen acres, which was subsequently contained by Cal Fire. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation, and no other personnel were reported to be affected.</p>

          <p>A former senior Chinese diplomat has warned that the European Union's strategy to "de-risk" by reducing its economic reliance on China could paradoxically deepen its dependence on the United States. Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, argued that the EU's recent trade agreement with Washington reinforces its reliance on the U.S. for both economic and security matters. Speaking at an event in Beijing, he asserted that this move undermines the EU's goal of achieving strategic autonomy. The commentary highlights Beijing's perspective that Europe's de-risking policy is a veiled attempt to contain China's growth.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that his government plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September. The move is conditioned on the Palestinian Authority implementing reforms, including holding elections in which Hamas cannot participate. This decision follows similar announcements from France and the UK, reflecting growing international pressure on Israel regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel condemned the move as a "reward for Hamas," while the White House also expressed opposition, aligning with Israel's position.</p>

This announcement follows similar reports from competitors like General Motors and Volkswagen, highlighting the significant financial strain President Trump's trade policies are placing on major American manufacturers.

          <p>Following an outcry from residents, Los Angeles city leaders have moved to restrict the construction of duplexes in the fire-ravaged Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The decision came after Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order allowing areas devastated by recent fires to be exempt from SB 9, a state law designed to increase housing density. Residents raised concerns that adding more homes would worsen evacuation dangers in the high-fire-risk area. The move is notable as officials have simultaneously encouraged the building of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), which have proven more popular among homeowners looking to rebuild.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had sued for malicious prosecution and civil rights violations after an involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dropped last year. The judge dismissed the case due to a lack of significant action, but Baldwin's attorneys have 30 days to refile and stated they would do so if settlement talks are not resolved. The lawsuit stemmed from the 2021 on-set incident where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, control costs, and could be fully operational by 2035 at a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project, which aims to significantly increase the airport's flight capacity.</p>

The team stated the issue was related to the humidity and expects him to make his next scheduled start. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2, capping a disappointing month for the team, but the news about Ohtani's minor ailment was a significant relief.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify reveals the initial impacts of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, which have pushed the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since 1934. While government tariff revenue has tripled, the U.S. goods trade deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling imports to avoid the taxes. The tariffs have significantly reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but there are early signs that the costs are being passed on to American consumers, with prices rising for certain imported goods. The policies have also prompted other countries to accelerate their own trade deals, reshaping global commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The rate remains in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, though in an unusual move, two board members dissented, voting in favor of a rate reduction. The decision comes amid uncertainty over the economic effects of the administration's tariffs, with policymakers remaining cautious about inflation, which is still above the 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that he sees little evidence that current interest rates are inappropriately holding back the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful ocean waves are typically generated by large, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use deep ocean sensors and tide gauges to predict their arrival and potential height. Experts stress that tsunamis are a series of waves, not a single event, and even small ones can create dangerously strong currents, making it crucial for people to heed evacuation warnings and move to higher ground immediately.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led scientific expedition has captured unprecedented images of abundant life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Using a human-occupied submersible, researchers discovered thriving communities of creatures, including fields of tube worms and beds of clams, in a pitch-black, high-pressure environment. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, converting chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust into energy. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life and suggest such ecosystems may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>
