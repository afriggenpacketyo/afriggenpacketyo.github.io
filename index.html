This ambulance, equipped with a mobile intensive care unit, is the latest in a series of donations, with plans to provide a total of 42 ambulances, 28 of which will be armored, and the funds for this specific vehicle were provided by Pastor Greg Laurie and his church. The ceremony included testimonies from terror survivors, including Karina Engel, whose husband was killed and who was held hostage by Hamas, and the ambulance dedicated in her husband's memory will be stationed near her home. The donation was praised by MDA leaders as a symbol of kindness and protection, highlighting the ongoing need for such resources in the face of continued threats.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing the pardon she received for her involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, seeking to formally block it with the help of her Republican senator. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the events, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the legitimacy of the Justice Department's actions. She argues that accepting the pardon would be an admission of guilt, something she cannot reconcile with her conscience, while other January 6 defendants have actively sought and utilized their pardon certificates. Hemphill's stance contrasts sharply with other Capitol riot defendants who celebrated their pardons, and she anticipates potential backlash from Trump for her decision.</p>

          <p>The use of robots in sculpture is transforming the art world, with companies like Robotor creating machines that carve with precision and speed, and CEO Giacomo Massari argues that robots are reviving Carrara's artistic fortunes by doing the heavy lifting, while some artists remain skeptical. Tuscan artist Michael Monfroni believes that only a human touch can coax the divine out of stone, and contemporary artist Barry X Ball uses robots to create impossible art, and he also acknowledges the criticism that using robots is cheating. Vermont-based artist Richard Erdman says that robots are becoming essential in the changing art world, and that using them reduces mistakes and allows artists to focus on the creative aspects of sculpture.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the ongoing threat to U.S. national security posed by Cuban spies, detailing the cases of Victor Manuel Rocha and Ana Montes, who were both high-ranking U.S. officials secretly spying for Cuba for decades. Rocha, a former U.S. ambassador, was recently charged with spying for Cuba throughout his career, and Ana Montes, a Pentagon official, spied for 17 years, and the article reveals that Cuba shares the information it obtains from its spies with enemies of the United States, including Russia, China, and Iran. Former FBI agent Peter Lapp says there are likely other Cuban spies currently in the U.S. government, and he described Montes as one of the most notorious spies in American history.</p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecast to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., including as far south as northern California and Alabama, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm is spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications, and space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with the geomagnetic storm. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, and are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz called President Xi Jinping to propose a deal: help end the war in Ukraine, signaling a shift to strategic realism. Merz appealed to Xi, noting the war's impact on Germany's national security, and urged Beijing to support joint U.S.-European ceasefire efforts. The call included appeals to common cause on climate, trade, and stability, and it contrasts with the previous government's values-based approach to China, prioritizing interests over lectures.</p>
