          <p>With Israeli forces mobilizing for a deeper advance into Gaza, mediators are urgently trying to broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Despite weeks of threats from Israeli leaders, there were no immediate signs of a large-scale ground invasion, as negotiators engaged in indirect talks in Qatar. Hamas officials indicated a willingness to negotiate without preconditions, while Israel linked Hamas's return to talks to the announcement of a new Israeli operation in Gaza. The ongoing conflict, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, has resulted in a dire humanitarian crisis and stalled international efforts to find a resolution.</p>

          <p>A 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaking haltingly and having memory lapses has been released, reigniting a debate over his fitness for office. The recording, from an interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, captures Biden's whispery voice and long pauses, giving a fuller picture of why Hur described him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." Top Democrats have had to rationalize their previous statements vouching for Biden's fitness, and the new debate recalls a period when Democratic officials called for Biden to drop out of the race.
