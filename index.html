          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the formation of the "America Party" following a public dispute with President Trump over a new spending bill, which Musk described as "insane spending." Establishing a new national political party in the U.S. is an extremely challenging endeavor, facing a thicket of complex state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules, and intense litigation from established parties. Election lawyers estimate it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to build a national presence, not being feasible by the 2026 midterms. Musk intends to initially focus on congressional races, aiming to secure a decisive vote on contentious legislation, though backing a presidential candidate is not ruled out.</p>

          <p>Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has rapidly become one of Africa's deadliest jihadist groups since its formation in 2017. Operating primarily across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, JNIM seeks to impose its strict interpretation of Sharia law, often clashing with local practices but exploiting disillusionment with state governance. The group's attacks have surged, doubling in Burkina Faso in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, causing significant casualties. Funded by cattle-rustling and various taxes, JNIM has proven resilient against counterinsurgency efforts, with recent military coups in the Sahel region further enabling its growth.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence, emphasizing its potential for inclusive growth while warning of widening digital disparities without fair governance. Their statement, agreed upon at a summit in Rio de Janeiro, stressed the need for technical specifications and protocols involving the public sector and UN agencies to ensure trust, interoperability, security, and reliability in AI. The group also urged equal access to AI technologies, data, and research capacity for all countries, particularly those in the Global South, to prevent standard-setting from becoming barriers to market entry.</p>

Many campers were asleep in low-lying cabins, leading to widespread devastation and significant loss of life. So far 78 fatalities have been confirmed in central Texas, with 68, including 28 children, in Kerr County, where the camp is located. The camp's longtime director and several young campers are among the dead, with ten girls and a counselor still missing.

The blaze, which originated east of Santa Maria, is currently threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument, a critical habitat for several endangered species. While one building has burned and 200 people remain under mandatory evacuation orders, officials are optimistic about continued progress over the next few days, ahead of a potential midweek heat wave that could challenge suppression efforts.

          <p>Steve Ballmer's career trajectory spans from selling brownie mix to leading Microsoft as CEO, and now owning the NBA's LA Clippers, a team for which he invested over $2 billion in a new arena. Known for his intense enthusiasm, Ballmer's wealth has soared past $100 billion, yet he maintains a relatively modest lifestyle, eschewing typical billionaire extravagances. He describes his passion for the Clippers as a different kind of "sweat" compared to Microsoft, prioritizing winning over revenue. Ballmer's journey highlights his evolution from a shy, anxious youth to a driven leader who, despite some past missteps like underestimating the iPhone, transformed businesses through sheer will and energy.</p>

          <p>Wyoming's Green River Drift, a 70-mile cattle drive, stands as the longest-running in the U.S., a tradition maintained by stubborn ranchers like Albert Sommers and Jeannie Lockwood for over 125 years. This demanding, multi-day trek, born from a harsh 1889 winter, involves moving thousands of cattle to high mountain pastures for summer grazing, enabling hay growth for winter. Despite challenges like predator losses, declining beef consumption, and dwindling ranch numbers, the participants are driven by a "labor of love" rather than profit. Conservation easements, like Sommers's, aim to preserve this iconic land and way of life for future generations, including young riders like Shad Swain.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes team, including correspondent Bill Whitaker, reported on the elite U.S. Coast Guard surfmen who train in the treacherous "Graveyard of the Pacific," a dangerous inlet near Washington and Oregon. This area, where the Columbia River meets powerful Pacific waves, has historically wrecked thousands of ships. Certified surfmen must perform daring rescues in 20-foot waves and 50-knot winds, enduring rigorous training that includes preparing for boat "rollovers" where the vessel spins 360 degrees. Whitaker himself tested a dry suit and experienced the intense conditions, noting the surfmen's remarkable calm and enjoyment amidst the chaos, highlighting their dedication to saving lives.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, this article assesses whether the UK is safer, reflecting on the evolution of its counter-terrorism strategy. The attacks exposed intelligence failures, prompting MI5 and police to improve collaboration and prioritize threats, leading to successes like foiling the liquid bomb plot. New legislation, such as the offense of preparing for terrorism, allowed earlier interventions. However, the rise of self-radicalized individuals and the far-right, fueled by online extremism, presents new challenges. Initiatives like Prevent and Martyn's Law, requiring security plans for venues, aim to enhance public safety, yet the threat remains diverse and complex.</p>

Prosecutors alleged Park and Bartkus shared extremist, anti-natalist views. Park's death has prompted questions about conditions at the L.A. detention center, with immigration lawyers reporting increasing calls about unmet medical needs, inhumane conditions, and a "ticking-time bomb" environment, concerns previously highlighted by a Justice Department Inspector General's report.</p>

          <p>A disagreement has emerged between Texas officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) regarding the adequacy of forecasts for the recent catastrophic floods that killed at least 78 people. While the NWS states it issued flood watches and flash flood warnings, including a "considerable" tag, some Texas officials, like Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, claim they did not anticipate a "water wall of almost thirty feet high." Meteorologists acknowledge the difficulty of precise precipitation forecasting for extreme events, but defend the NWS's protocols. The debate also touches on past NWS job cuts and potential future funding cuts for weather research, raising concerns about preparedness.</p>

He explains its core elements, including government-to-government cooperation, academic exchanges, and mechanisms for data sharing and IP protection, highlighting its symbolic value in building trust during fragile diplomatic ties. In the current geopolitical climate, the STA has become politically sensitive due to national security concerns, economic competitiveness in AI and semiconductors, and techno-nationalism. Simon notes a past instance where IP protection concerns nearly hindered a joint clean energy project, illustrating the ongoing challenges of balancing openness with security.</p>

While Piastri was left furious and confused by the stewards' decision, Norris's triumph marks his second consecutive Grand Prix victory, significantly reducing his championship deficit to Piastri and affirming McLaren's impressive performance this season.</p>
