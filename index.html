          <p>Villanova University reported that a warning of an active shooter on its Pennsylvania campus was a "cruel hoax," which had triggered a major law enforcement response and a campus lockdown. University President Rev. Peter Donohue expressed relief that no one was harmed but noted the incident had severely shaken the community. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned the act of "swatting," stating that state and federal authorities, including the FBI, will investigate to find and prosecute those responsible for the fake threat.</p>

          <p>California's legislature has approved a special election in November for voters to decide on redrawing the state's congressional map, a move aimed at creating up to five new Democratic-leaning districts. The plan, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas intended to benefit the GOP. This sets up an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle between the nation's two most populous states, with Democrats arguing it is a necessary measure to counter a Republican "power grab."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 9-5, relying on a strong offensive performance to earn a split in their four-game series at Coors Field. The scoring began early with a two-run homer from Freddie Freeman in the first inning, and the Dodgers continued to build their lead throughout the game. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win of the season, allowing three runs over five and two-thirds innings. The victory provides momentum as the Dodgers head into a critical series against the second-place San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar financial penalty imposed on former President Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, ruling that the amount was excessive. While the court upheld the underlying finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it concluded the monetary award was not justified by the harm caused. Other non-monetary penalties, such as a three-year ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, remain in place as the Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision on the fine.</p>

          <p>Florida's Department of Transportation has painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that served as a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer condemned the removal as a "cruel political act," stating it undermined a symbol of remembrance and pedestrian safety. The action aligns with Governor Ron DeSantis's administration's policy against pavement art with "social, political or ideological messages," a move that critics argue is hostile toward the LGBTQ community and local autonomy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity. The ruling lifts a lower court's order that had required the NIH to restore hundreds of grants, allowing the administration to pull funding it deems misaligned with its policy goals. The legal challenge, brought by over a dozen states and research groups, will continue in lower courts, but the decision marks a significant development in the administration's efforts to reshape federal funding priorities.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's concert residency in Puerto Rico has created a surge in business for local tattoo artists, as both locals and tourists seek permanent souvenirs inspired by his latest album. Artists are using the increased demand for designs like the national flower and native frogs as an opportunity to educate clients about Puerto Rican culture and heritage. The trend is providing a welcome economic boost during a typically slow season and allowing artists to foster a deeper appreciation for the island's identity among a global audience.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has stated her interest in joining the sequel to the blockbuster film "A Minecraft Movie," candidly admitting her motivation is to make "a pile of cash." In a recent interview, the veteran actress, who has been working since childhood, contrasted the financial success of the Minecraft film with her recent projects, like the critically acclaimed but more modestly earning "Civil War." Dunst's highest-grossing film remains 2007's "Spider-Man 3," and her comment highlights the financial realities many actors face, even with successful and respected careers in independent and prestige cinema.</p>

          <h2>Market Analysis: Shifting Views on Fed Rate Cuts Impact Tech and Cyclical Stocks Differently</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 16:52:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market behavior indicates a shift in how investors are viewing potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with implications varying between tech and cyclical stocks. While lower rates traditionally boost high-growth tech valuations, recent trading shows investors rotating into value-oriented, cyclical names like Home Depot, which benefit more directly from lower borrowing costs through near-term earnings improvements. Conversely, momentum stocks tied to secular trends like AI have seen profit-taking, as their growth is less dependent on immediate rate changes, suggesting the market is currently prioritizing tangible earnings revisions over theoretical valuation models.

          <p>Newly released public records show that during immigration raids in Los Angeles, the U.S. military compiled a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid" due to protests targeting federal agents staying there. Activists organized demonstrations, some lasting through the night, to pressure hotels into evicting ICE and CBP officers, successfully disrupting the administration's operations. The documents reveal that the community backlash was significant enough for military and law enforcement agencies to actively track protest locations to prevent their personnel from being "harassed," highlighting the effectiveness of the grassroots demonstrations.</p>
