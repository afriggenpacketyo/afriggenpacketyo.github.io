          <p>A demonstration organized by anti-immigration protesters in The Hague, Netherlands, descended into violence weeks before the country's general election. Rioters clashed with authorities, throwing objects, setting a police car on fire, and vandalizing the office of the centrist D66 political party. Police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd, which had blocked a major highway. Political leaders, including caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing lawmaker Geert Wilders, condemned the violence as unacceptable.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration has intensified its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing warnings to California, New York, and Illinois. The administration has threatened lawsuits and federal funding cuts if these states continue to refuse cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers. The states argue that compliance with these detainers is voluntary and that their policies foster trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. The federal government contends these policies release dangerous individuals and obstruct immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is gaining strength in the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become the second hurricane of the 2025 season. Currently located southeast of Bermuda, the storm is projected to reach Category 2 strength with winds up to 105 mph. While it is not expected to make direct landfall in Bermuda or the U.S. mainland, it will generate dangerous swells and life-threatening surf conditions for Bermuda and parts of the U.S. East Coast. The formation of the season's second hurricane is nearly a month later than the historical average.</p>

          <p>An arrest has been made after the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento was struck by gunfire in what police are calling a drive-by shooting. At least three rounds hit the building, though no injuries were reported among the station's employees. Authorities identified and arrested 64-year-old Anibal Hernandezsantana in connection with the incident, charging him with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building. The motive remains under investigation, and the event has drawn condemnation from public officials as an attack on journalism and democracy.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, an Italian ship's cook, shares her story of being stranded at sea for over six months after taking a last-minute job on a cargo schooner. Her three-month voyage to Central America was unexpectedly extended when the COVID-19 pandemic led to worldwide lockdowns, closing ports and borders. The crew of the Avontuur faced isolation, dwindling supplies, and rising tensions while being denied shore leave at multiple ports. The experience highlights the profound global disruption caused by the pandemic and the resilience of those caught in extraordinary circumstances.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist who was recently killed, rose to prominence as a leading voice for young MAGA supporters. He co-founded Turning Point USA at age 18, building a massive social media following by engaging in combative debates on college campuses and spreading conservative, Christian-nationalist ideas. Kirk was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, who praised him for mobilizing young voters. His controversial stances on race, immigration, and other social issues often drew sharp criticism, but he was celebrated by supporters for challenging liberal orthodoxy.</p>

          <p>A new stage adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" transposes the story of the meddling matchmaker to modern-day Essex. Written by Ava Pickett, this version portrays Emma Woodhouse as a clever but haughty university student who interferes in her friends' love lives via dating apps instead of society balls. The production explores contemporary themes of social validation, online dating toxicity, and complex female friendships, while retaining the core wit and character traits of the original 1815 novel. The play aims to highlight the timelessness of Austen's observations on human relationships.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are taking on significant part-time work and long commutes because their government maintenance loans are insufficient to cover basic living expenses. Recent studies indicate that the maximum loan covers only about half of the required amount for a minimum standard of living, leaving a substantial shortfall. Students report working up to 30 hours a week or commuting for hours from their family homes to afford rent, food, and other necessities.

          <p>Efforts to establish trilateral nuclear arms control talks involving the United States, Russia, and China have hit an impasse, raising concerns about a potential new arms race. A push by the Trump administration for China to join denuclearization discussions was firmly rejected by Beijing, which views the proposal as unrealistic. China maintains that its nuclear arsenal is kept at a minimum level for national security and that it does not engage in arms races. This stalemate complicates the future of existing treaties like New START and underscores the growing geopolitical tensions between the three nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan has sparked controversy by comparing the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk to a "modern-day St. Paul." In a television appearance, Dolan described Kirk as a heroic evangelist and missionary, suggesting his death could inspire renewed faith among young people. The remarks drew praise from some supporters but also significant outrage on social media, with critics pointing to Kirk's divisive rhetoric and Dolan's own controversial history within the church. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed during a speaking event at a university in Utah.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a significant policy change by adding a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a program widely used by technology and other firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The White House stated the one-time fee applies only to future applicants and not to current visa holders or renewals, aiming to protect American jobs and prevent system abuses. The move has been criticized by some who argue it could incentivize companies to move jobs overseas and deter international students from studying in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The governments of India and South Korea are assessing the impact on their citizens and industries, with India's Ministry of External Affairs noting potential humanitarian consequences for families. The fee is seen as the administration's most aggressive move to restrict legal immigration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce the United Kingdom's formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a major shift in British foreign policy. This move follows a deadline set by the prime minister in July, conditioning the decision on Israel's agreement to a ceasefire and commitment to a two-state solution. The decision has drawn strong criticism from the Israeli government and some hostage families, who argue it rewards terrorism. However, the UK government cites the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements as key factors.</p>

          <p>Researchers have made a significant discovery with implications for fusion energy by successfully inducing shock-induced amorphization in diamond capsules using powerful lasers. This process, where the diamond's atomic structure collapses under extreme pressure, helps scientists better understand how to create the symmetrical implosions necessary for releasing nuclear fusion energy. The breakthrough could advance the development of fusion as a clean, nearly limitless power source, potentially reducing global reliance on fossil fuels and their associated environmental impacts.</p>

The new laws include a first-in-the-nation ban on federal and local law enforcement officers wearing masks while on duty, a direct response to recent immigration raids involving masked agents. Other bills restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of any enforcement activity on campus.
