          <p>Spain is creating friction with the Trump administration by pursuing a distinct foreign policy path. The Spanish government has opted for European military aircraft over U.S. F-35s and has resisted pressure to meet new NATO defense spending targets. Additionally, Madrid is fostering closer economic relationships with China, including awarding a contract to Huawei, which has drawn criticism from both the U.S. and EU. Analysts suggest this approach allows Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to distract from domestic issues, gambling that Spain's EU membership will shield it from significant U.S. retaliation.</p>

          <p>A specific model of a knee-replacement implant, used in thousands of NHS operations, was known to have a high failure rate for eight years before its 2022 recall. A BBC investigation reveals that patients who received the NexGen implant from manufacturer Zimmer Biomet suffered severe pain, immobility, and addiction to painkillers due to the component slipping out of place. Surgeons and internal documents suggest the company was slow to acknowledge the problem, which was first flagged by the National Joint Registry in 2014. The corrective surgeries are now costing the NHS millions of pounds.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level in over two years, in response to a slowing economy. The central bank also lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2025 from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker public demand. This monetary easing is possible because inflation has substantially decreased from its 2022 peak, now sitting near the RBA's target range. The decision comes as Australia navigates a challenging trade environment, including new U.S. tariffs, and weaker-than-expected economic performance in the first quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China engaged in a sharp dispute at a UN Security Council meeting regarding the Panama Canal. The U.S. expressed concerns that China's growing influence over the canal's port operations and critical infrastructure poses a potential threat to global trade and security. In response, China's ambassador accused the U.S. of fabricating lies as a pretext to regain control over the vital waterway. The exchange occurred during a meeting chaired by Panama's president, who emphasized his country's neutrality and sovereign control over the canal.</p>

          <p>In a federal trial over the legality of President Trump's 2024 military deployment in Los Angeles, a top general testified he never heard the situation described as a "rebellion." The trial stems from a lawsuit by California Governor Gavin Newsom, who argues the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who commanded the task force, stated that the term "rebellion," which the administration used to legally justify the action, was not used in his communications. The testimony challenges the federal government's primary justification for deploying thousands of troops to the city.</p>

          <p>Miguel Uribe Turbay, a 39-year-old Colombian senator and presidential candidate, has died from injuries sustained in a shooting two months ago. Uribe was shot three times during a campaign rally in Bogota in June and had been in intensive care since the attack. The assassination attempt alarmed a nation that has not seen such high-level political violence since the 1990s. A prominent conservative critic of the current leftist government, Uribe was the son of a journalist killed during the era of Pablo Escobar's narco-terrorism, and his death has been mourned as a blow to Colombia's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' lead in the NL West has been reduced to a single game after a 7-4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. Dodgers starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had one of his worst outings, giving up six runs in just over four innings, including a first-pitch home run to Zach Neto. The Dodgers' offense remained quiet for most of the game, only managing late home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy when the deficit was too large to overcome. This loss marks the Dodgers' 19th defeat in 31 games since early July, highlighting a period of significant struggle for the reigning champions.</p>

According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, even historically resilient reefs like Ningaloo and Rowley Shoals have been severely impacted.

          <h2>Nepal Waives Climbing Fees for 97 Mountains to Boost Tourism in Remote Regions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to promote tourism in its less-developed western provinces, Nepal will waive climbing permit fees for 97 Himalayan peaks for the next two years. This initiative aims to draw mountaineers to remote areas and generate local economic activity. The move contrasts with a recent decision to increase the permit fee for Mount Everest to $15,000 during peak season, its first hike in nearly a decade. While officials hope the fee waiver will highlight unexplored destinations, it is unclear if infrastructure will be improved to support a potential influx of climbers to these overlooked mountains.</p>

          <p>Two armed suspects led authorities on a chaotic two-hour pursuit from Lancaster to downtown Los Angeles, successfully evading capture despite an extensive police response. The chase began with the carjacking of a pickup truck, followed by the theft of a big rig, which the suspects then drove against traffic on the 10 Freeway. After abandoning the semi-truck, they carjacked a third vehicle before finally disappearing near a freeway underpass. Authorities recovered a loaded firearm from the first stolen vehicle and believe additional suspects may have assisted in the final escape.</p>

The whistleblower, who reportedly worked for the committee for over a decade, described the alleged 2017 plan as "treasonous" and "illegal" in interviews with the FBI. The documents state the staffer attended a meeting where Schiff allegedly greenlit leaking derogatory classified information with the stated goal of indicting President Trump.

          <p>In a move that bypassed local elected officials, President Donald Trump has seized control of the Washington D.C. police force and ordered National Guard troops into the capital.

The president also warned that other Democrat-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles could be next.

The agreement, confirmed by an executive order from President Trump, prevents a significant escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. The pause is intended to allow more time for negotiations on trade imbalances and other economic issues. The context for this extension includes U.S. pressure on China to increase purchases of American soybeans and a recent deal allowing U.S. chipmakers to sell to China in exchange for a percentage of their revenue.
