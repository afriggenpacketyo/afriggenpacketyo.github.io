          <h2>Supreme Court Asked to Intervene in Deportation Case</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to block a lower court order requiring the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that a federal court cannot compel the president to engage in foreign diplomacy, asserting Garcia is a gang member. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's decision, stating the government cannot remove someone lawfully present in the U.S. without due process. Garcia was deported despite having protected legal status.</p>

          <p>Restaurant stocks experienced a downturn following investors' worries about a potential recession triggered by President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. Analysts suggest the tariffs' inflationary effects will strain consumer spending, impacting industry demand. Starbucks shares notably fell after a downgrade, with concerns including higher coffee costs from tariffs and anti-American sentiment. The trade tensions also pose risks to Starbucks' international sales, particularly in China, where political boycotts of Western brands have occurred. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investors seeking safe havens like certificates of deposit (CDs) amid market volatility should shop around for the best rates, according to financial advisors. Research suggests consumers may benefit from choosing longer-term CDs and paying early withdrawal penalties, as this can sometimes yield higher returns than shorter-term CDs. While CDs offer guaranteed returns, they also come with less liquidity and lower long-term returns compared to the stock market. Experts caution against panic-selling stocks to move into CDs, as it can lock in losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if China proceeds with its planned retaliatory 34% tariff on American products. This escalation follows Trump's earlier implementation of reciprocal tariffs on numerous nations. Economists warn that the escalating trade war could impede economic growth and potentially lead to a recession. Tariffs are typically passed on to consumers via higher prices, which could reignite inflation.</p>

          <p>Homeowners can negotiate home equity loan closing costs to reduce upfront expenses. Origination, application, appraisal, and title fees are typically easier to negotiate, while recording and credit report fees are harder. Comparing offers from multiple lenders is crucial for finding the best deal. Effective negotiation involves being prepared, asking questions, and maintaining respect for lenders. Patience is also important, as the closing process can take several weeks. (not investment advice)</p>
