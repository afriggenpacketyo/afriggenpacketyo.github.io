          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, is in Washington to negotiate with U.S. officials regarding new transatlantic trade tariffs. A primary goal of his visit is to secure an exemption or a quota system for German steel, aiming to protect domestic jobs and industry from a new 15% EU-wide tariff. Klingbeil expressed disappointment with the overall EU-US agreement, suggesting the EU was not strong enough in negotiations. The article also touches on other German domestic issues, including refugee benefits and national defense sentiment.</p>

This move is intended to de-escalate trade tensions and provide time for further negotiations following a recent agreement between President Trump and EU Commission President von der Leyen. The deal involves a 15% US tariff on most European goods, while the EU has committed to removing tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and increasing investments, though the specifics of these commitments remain under discussion.</p>

The incident, which occurred on July 28, had already claimed the lives of a 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl, with a fourth child also injured. The children were part of a sailing camp operated by the Miami Yacht Club. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the tragic crash, which will also involve investigators from Argentina, the home nation of one of the victims.</p>

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas after Democratic lawmakers left the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial redistricting plan. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove any absent members from the Texas House if they do not return by a set deadline. The proposed map, supported by President Trump, could add up to five new Republican seats to the U.S. House. The Democratic legislators, who have traveled to other states, argue they are fighting against a partisan effort to rig future elections.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has identified a controversial migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' as a model for future state-run facilities. The administration plans to establish similar centers near airports in states like Arizona and Louisiana to improve efficiency in detaining and deporting unauthorized migrants. This strategy aims to reduce reliance on for-profit prisons and cut costs, but it faces legal challenges and criticism over inhumane conditions and the legality of state-run immigration detention.</p>

Describing their walkout as a 'righteous act of courage,' Pritzker is offering support as the Texas lawmakers face threats of expulsion and arrest from their home state's Republican leaders. The Texas Democrats are protesting a map they argue is designed to unfairly benefit Republicans in future elections by silencing minority voters.

          <p>Military surgeons are raising alarms that the widespread misuse of tourniquets on the Ukrainian battlefield is causing a high number of unnecessary amputations and deaths. While tourniquets are vital for stopping catastrophic bleeding, prolonged evacuation times in Ukraine mean they are often left on for too long, leading to tissue death. Experts argue that in many cases, pressure bandages would be more appropriate, but a 'cult-like' dependence on tourniquets persists. They are now urging for revised medical guidelines tailored to the specific challenges of the Ukrainian conflict.</p>

          <p>After a decade of investigation, scientists have identified the cause of a mysterious disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the coelomic fluid of infected sea stars. The epidemic, known as sea star wasting disease, devastated more than 20 species and had cascading effects on the ecosystem, leading to an explosion of sea urchins and the destruction of kelp forests. This discovery provides hope for developing interventions to help restore sea star populations.</p>
