          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour title in over two years, triumphing over American JJ Spaun in a dramatic sudden-death playoff at the St Jude Championship in Memphis. The victory was sealed on the third extra hole when Rose carded a birdie that Spaun could not match, concluding a nail-biting finish. This win represents a significant return to form for the 45-year-old world number 20, providing a stark contrast to the disappointment for compatriot Tommy Fleetwood. Fleetwood had entered the final round with the lead but ultimately finished one shot shy of the playoff, extending his quest for a first victory on the American circuit.</p>

          <p>The man suspected of the deadly shooting at the CDC campus in Atlanta was allegedly driven by a belief that the COVID-19 vaccine was the cause of his declining health and depression. According to law enforcement sources, the suspect, Patrick White, had become fixated on vaccine-related conspiracies, a sentiment echoed by neighbors who knew him. The targeted attack resulted in the fatal shooting of DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose and prompted the CDC to have most employees work remotely. While the investigation is ongoing, officials have stated the incident was a targeted attack on the agency related to COVID, highlighting the dangerous real-world consequences of health misinformation.</p>

          <p>During a game between the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros, broadcasters Michael Kay and Paul O'Neill delighted fans with numerous jokes and references to the sitcom 'Seinfeld'. The humor was prompted by the fact that the Astros' starting pitcher was named Jason Alexander, the same as the actor who famously played George Costanza. The announcers incorporated famous lines from the show into their commentary and scouting report, creating a memorable and lighthearted broadcast. Former Yankee Paul O'Neill, who once guest-starred on 'Seinfeld', even shared anecdotes about his appearance, adding a layer of nostalgic fun to the baseball game, which the Astros ultimately won.</p>

          <p>As the Lee fire in Colorado grew to become the sixth-largest in the state's history, authorities ordered the full evacuation of the Rifle Correctional Center. All 179 inmates were safely transferred to another facility as a precautionary measure against the rapidly spreading blaze. The fire has consumed over 167 square miles in Garfield and Rio Blanco counties with minimal containment, fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the wildfire, which has so far caused no reported injuries or structural damage, though air quality warnings have been issued for the surrounding areas due to heavy smoke from it and another nearby fire.</p>

The daughter of Hollywood legends Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, she spoke about initially wanting to be a police officer before unexpectedly landing an acting contract. Curtis reflected on key roles in films like "Trading Places" and "True Lies," her struggles with addiction after a negative experience with plastic surgery, and her decision to prioritize family by taking on commercial work. Now sober for 26 years, she champions authenticity and has found freedom in embracing imperfection, surpassing her parents' legacies by her own emotional and professional standards.</p>

          <p>Decades after World War II, families of victims are working to ensure the world remembers the tragic fate of the Cap Arcona, a German luxury liner turned into a floating concentration camp. In the final days of the war, the ship was packed with thousands of prisoners and anchored in the Baltic Sea, where it was mistakenly attacked and sunk by the British Royal Air Force. The friendly-fire incident killed approximately 7,000 people, most of them prisoners who had survived the horrors of the camps only to die hours before liberation. This historical account details the ship's journey and the devastating human cost of one of the war's least-known maritime disasters.</p>

The victims, identified as Anas al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, and Mohammed Noufal, were in a tent designated for press when the strike occurred. Shortly after, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed targeting Anas al-Sharif, whom they accused of being a Hamas operative posing as a journalist, but did not mention the other casualties. The incident has intensified concerns over the safety of media personnel in the conflict zone, with the Committee to Protect Journalists reporting 186 journalists killed since October 2023.</p>

          <p>A contentious fight over redistricting in Texas has intensified, with Democratic lawmakers accusing Republicans of attempting to "cheat" by redrawing congressional maps mid-decade to gain a political advantage. To block the GOP-led effort, Texas Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to conduct business. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the lawmakers arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special sessions until the matter is resolved. Prominent Democrats, including Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor JB Pritzker, have defended the maneuver as a necessary response to what they call an undemocratic power grab orchestrated by former President Trump.</p>

The Invasive Species Council has issued a stark warning that the entire country is at risk if the infestation is not contained, projecting a potential economic impact of $2 billion annually. Fire ants pose a significant threat to the environment, livestock, and native animals, and their aggressive nature and painful stings are a health risk to humans. Authorities are conducting genetic tracing to determine the origin of the ants while increasing surveillance and eradication efforts in the affected region.</p>

The potential tariffs add another layer of complexity to the already strained U.S.-China trade relationship, which affects numerous global economic factors beyond the conflict in Ukraine.

Under the justification of security, and with support from hardline nationalist ministers in the Israeli government, settlers are accelerating the expansion of outposts and displacing Palestinian communities. The UN reports an average of four settler attacks per day, with human rights groups accusing Israeli forces of failing to protect Palestinians and sometimes participating in the violence. This campaign is seen by many as a concerted effort to extinguish hopes for a Palestinian state by systematically taking over more land.</p>

Speaking on the 80th anniversary of the war, Mitter highlights that the conflict had a devastating impact on China, shattering much of the infrastructure and communications that had been developed in the preceding decades. This destruction forced the country into a position of having to rebuild almost from scratch in the post-war era. Mitter's analysis suggests that understanding this historical context is crucial for comprehending China's subsequent political and societal development, as well as its current interests in a peaceful Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>England's Rehan Ahmed delivered a star performance with both bat and ball to guide the Trent Rockets to a five-wicket victory over the Northern Superchargers in the men's Hundred competition. The 20-year-old first took two key wickets to help restrict the Superchargers to a modest total of 124-9. He then contributed a crucial 31 runs during the chase, stabilizing the innings after the Rockets' spinners had caused a middle-order wobble. Despite a tense finish, the Rockets successfully reached their target with four balls remaining, maintaining their unbeaten start to the tournament thanks to Ahmed's decisive contributions in both facets of the game.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has pushed back against allegations from Chinese state-affiliated media that its H20 artificial intelligence chips present a national security risk to China. An article on WeChat claimed the chips could be remotely shut down via a hardware "backdoor," a charge Nvidia firmly denies, stating that cybersecurity is critically important and no such backdoors exist. This dispute comes amid escalating U.S.-China tensions over semiconductor export controls. The H20 chip was specifically developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. restrictions, which are rooted in concerns that Beijing could leverage advanced AI technology for military purposes.</p>

          <p>A man in Austria survived a dangerous ordeal after clinging to the outside of a high-speed train that had departed a station without him. The passenger had reportedly been taking a cigarette break on the platform in Sankt Poelten when the train began to leave, prompting him to jump into the space between two carriages. He banged on windows to alert those inside, and the conductor performed an emergency stop to bring him safely aboard. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible, noting such incidents usually end fatally and endanger rescuers as well. The 24-year-old man was met by police upon the train's delayed arrival in Vienna.</p>

          <p>Supporters of English football club Sheffield Wednesday have intensified their protests against owner Dejphon Chansiri, demanding he sell the club amid a deepening crisis. Protests included flying a banner over a recent match and displaying flags calling for his exit.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan to take military control of Gaza City, calling it the "best way to end the war speedily," even as Israel faced heavy criticism at an emergency UN Security Council meeting. Multiple nations, including the U.K. and France, condemned the plan, warning it would trigger another humanitarian calamity and further endanger hostages. Netanyahu claimed the offensive would free Gaza from Hamas and denied accusations of starving Gazans, while the UN humanitarian office stated the hunger crisis has escalated to "starvation, pure and simple."
