          <p>A series of powerful earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 7.4, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The seismic activity initially prompted tsunami warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii. However, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later confirmed that the danger had passed, and Russian authorities reported no immediate casualties or significant damage from the quakes or subsequent aftershocks. The event recalled the historical context of a massive 1952 Kamchatka quake that generated large waves in Hawaii.</p>

          <p>On the closing night of Verdi's "Il trovatore," a cast member staged a protest by displaying a large Palestinian flag during the curtain call at London's Royal Opera House. A brief scuffle ensued when an official tried to remove the flag, but the performer resisted. The Royal Opera House condemned the unauthorized action, stating it was "completely inappropriate" and violated their commitment to political impartiality. The incident highlights the ongoing visibility of the Israel-Gaza conflict in public and cultural spaces.</p>

          <p>European health agencies are highlighting the increased risk of vibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio bacteria, in coastal waters like the Baltic and North Seas. Rising sea temperatures and lower salinity, linked to climate change, create more favorable conditions for the bacteria to thrive. While infections are relatively rare, they can be severe, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems, and are typically contracted by eating raw shellfish or swimming with open wounds. Officials advise caution and awareness of symptoms like diarrhea, cramps, and fever.</p>

          <p>Following conservative criticism of director James Gunn's description of Superman as an "immigrant," author Grant Morrison explains the character's progressive origins. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original 1930s Superman was a "Champion of the Oppressed," fighting corrupt bosses and tearing down slums. Morrison, whose work influenced the new film, notes that Superman's character has evolved over the decades, from a patriotic figure during WWII to a family man in the 1950s. The article argues that the character's enduring power lies in his allegorical nature and ability to reflect contemporary societal values.</p>

Since gaining control of 10 councils in May, Reform has pledged to cut wasteful spending but has faced criticism for its own decisions, such as hiring political assistants in Warwickshire. Farage defended this move, arguing it is necessary to overcome bureaucratic resistance and implement the will of voters.

          <p>This opinion article argues that in his second term, Donald Trump has effectively dominated the political landscape by transforming the system and reshaping the balance of power. The author suggests that pro-democracy forces have been ineffective because they only denounce Trump instead of learning from his political methods. To counter him, opponents should adopt his tactics of telling a simple, relentless story, appealing to national pride, and building a determined movement outside of traditional party structures. The piece concludes that defeating Trump's authoritarian push requires offering a compelling alternative vision for constitutional reform.</p>

Drutman suggests that a move toward proportional representation, common in other democracies, could be a solution, as it would allow multiple parties to gain legislative seats and make every vote more meaningful.

This pressure to "throw harder" is impacting young athletes, with a 2015 study showing over half of such surgeries are performed on teenagers.

          <p>A brown bear, known as JJ4 or Gaia, that killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The bear's fate became the subject of intense legal battles and protests after an initial order for her euthanasia was challenged by animal rights groups. The relocation, conducted in secret to avoid protests, marks a resolution to the debate over human-wildlife conflict in Italy's Trentino region, where the bear population has grown. JJ4 will now live in a secure, specially constructed enclosure.</p>

          <p>The official X account of the beloved Sesame Street character Elmo was recently hacked, with attackers posting hate speech and racist slurs to millions of followers. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities faced even by trusted global brands. Cybersecurity experts note that such attacks are often aimed at causing chaos and damaging reputations rather than stealing data. The breach underscores the importance of robust security measures like unique passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular audits of account access to prevent the digital defacement of trusted icons.</p>

          <p>A rare fossil of a Sinopterus pterosaur discovered in northeastern China contains the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for this type of flying reptile. The findings, published in Science Bulletin, reveal that the creature's stomach contained phytoliths, which are microscopic mineral deposits from plants. Researchers also found small quartz crystals, likely ingested as gastroliths to help grind the tough plant matter. This discovery provides direct proof of a herbivorous diet for this pterosaur species, shedding new light on the diverse lifestyles of the creatures that dominated the skies during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>This column explores the recent cultural debate about whether children should have scheduled summer camps or unstructured "wild" summers, arguing that the discussion often misses the point. The author notes that for most families, the choice is dictated by financial and logistical realities, not parenting philosophy. The piece suggests that the intense focus on the "right" way to do summer creates "mom guilt" and overlooks the systemic failures that burden parents, such as a lack of affordable childcare and support. Ultimately, the yearning for an idealized summer reflects a deeper desire for a reduced mental load.</p>

          <p>A monument in Mexico City depicting the first meeting between revolutionaries Fidel Castro and Che Guevara has been abruptly removed, igniting a political and ideological controversy. The conservative borough president who ordered the removal cited a lack of permits and later called the figures an affront to human dignity. In contrast, Mexico's leftist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, criticized the action, arguing the monument represents a significant historical moment that occurred in Mexico. The debate mirrors broader cultural conflicts over historical statues, reflecting the lingering ideological fault lines of the Cold War.</p>

The film features former wrestlers and a referee who claim they reported Strauss's behavior to officials, including then-assistant coach and current Congressman Jim Jordan, but were dismissed. Jordan has consistently denied any knowledge of the abuse. The documentary brings renewed attention to the scandal as Jordan, a key Trump ally, reportedly faces a deposition in a federal civil lawsuit filed by some of the abuse survivors.</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein contains all the hallmarks of a classic, enduring conspiracy theory, blending known facts with institutional distrust. The narrative involves a wealthy, powerful sex offender with elite connections, a lenient plea deal, and a mysterious death in custody. President Trump, who once moved in the same social circles as Epstein, has fueled the intrigue by first suggesting a secret client list existed and then dismissing the matter. This reversal has created a backlash among some of his own supporters, demonstrating the difficulty of controlling a conspiratorial narrative.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, President Trump's promises of swift, major foreign policy victories remain largely unrealized, according to this analysis. Pledges to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, halt Iran's nuclear program, and negotiate dozens of trade deals have not been achieved, with his "force of personality" approach proving insufficient. While he has secured increased NATO defense spending and brokered some ceasefires, his core principles of anti-alliance, anti-trade, and pro-autocrat sentiment have often impeded progress. Critics argue his actions are undermining the post-WWII international order.</p>

This strategy of online trolling, which includes gleeful jokes about deportation, is seen by experts as a deliberate campaign to stoke outrage and cater to the president's base.

          <p>The public health system in Los Angeles County is facing a severe financial crisis due to significant funding cuts from the Trump administration.

The Department of Public Health also faces a potential $200 million cut, threatening essential services like disease monitoring and substance use treatment.

In response, California has filed over 30 lawsuits against the administration on issues ranging from education cuts to birthright citizenship.
