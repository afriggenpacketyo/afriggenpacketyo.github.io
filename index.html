          <p>Sean Dickson guided Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final with a stunning late-game performance. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four to secure the win with just one ball to spare, finishing with an unbeaten 71 from 26 balls. Despite a strong start from the Bears, who set a target of 190-6, Somerset's victory marks their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day, continuing the Bears' streak of last-eight defeats. The win was a remarkable comeback after Somerset's run chase appeared to be faltering.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has condemned President Donald Trump's threats to federalize the city's law enforcement, calling the rhetoric authoritarian and urging residents to "protect Chicago." The statement came after Trump posted a provocative image on Truth Social suggesting a military occupation to conduct deportations. In response, a coalition of activist groups has planned emergency protests against what they describe as a racist pretext for implementing white supremacist policies. While Democratic leaders have strongly opposed the idea, some local officials believe a federal surge could be helpful in reducing crime rates further.</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for nearly 92,000 Jeep Grand Cherokee plug-in hybrid SUVs from model years 2022-2026 due to a critical software error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the defect can cause an unexpected loss of drive power, increasing the risk of a crash without any prior warning. The issue stems from a microprocessor overload in the Battery Pack Control Module, which is misinterpreted by the vehicle's hybrid control processor. While a remedy is currently under development, the company stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London against the UK government's proscription of the campaign group Palestine Action resulted in the arrest of more than 425 people. Hundreds gathered in Parliament Square to oppose the ban, with most arrests made for the offense of supporting a proscribed organization under the Terrorism Act. The Metropolitan Police reported an "exceptional level of abuse" from some protesters, while organizers accused officers of using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators. The event highlights the intense public division over the government's decision to criminalize the group, which critics argue infringes on free speech.</p>

          <p>Residents of Chicago are expressing deeply divided opinions regarding President Trump's threat to deploy the National Guard to combat crime, a plan local and state Democratic leaders have vowed to resist. In neighborhoods heavily affected by violence, some community leaders argue that local anti-violence initiatives are the real solution, stating, "We are the troops." However, in other areas, residents welcome the idea of federal intervention, believing it is necessary to control crime. The debate occurs as crime statistics show a significant decrease in homicides, yet anxiety remains high, compounded by fears of potential large-scale immigration raids.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has issued a warning to the United States, urging de-escalation and cautioning against a "large-scale military conflict" in South America. This comes amid heightened tensions, including the recent deployment of U.S. warships off the Venezuelan coast for what Washington calls counter-narcotics operations. Maduro called on the U.S. to abandon plans for "violent regime change" and respect Venezuela's sovereignty, announcing the activation of over 5,300 communal militia units for defense. The situation intensified after the U.S. claimed it fired on a Venezuelan boat, killing 11 alleged drug smugglers.</p>

Although he was expected to return to filming, the BBC has now confirmed he will not be coming back. Borthwick, one of the show's longest-serving cast members, had previously apologized for the incident, which disability charity Scope called on him to use as an educational opportunity.</p>

The president has not attended the tournament since 2015, when he was booed by spectators.

Despite American football's niche status in soccer-dominated Brazil, the game drew nearly 50,000 fans, demonstrating the potential for expansion.

However, critics noted a lack of creativity and momentum, with some arguing the team has regressed since the last European Championship.

A preliminary report from Portugal's transport safety office stated the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper car to derail and crash into a building at approximately 60 km/h. The report noted that the brakeman's attempt to apply emergency brakes was unsuccessful and that the cable was only about halfway through its expected operational life.

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their place in the Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 consecutive Tests. Despite a shaky start where Australia scored first and dominated possession, England recovered to score seven tries, with Sadia Kabeya and Kelsey Clifford each scoring twice. The win sets up a quarter-final match against Scotland, but England faces injury concerns for key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman. The initial struggle against the seventh-ranked Wallaroos may offer encouragement to England's top rivals as the tournament enters the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>Joseph David Emerson, a former pilot, has pleaded guilty to federal charges after attempting to shut down the engines of an Alaska Airlines passenger jet mid-flight. Emerson, who was riding off-duty in the cockpit, told pilots he was "not okay" before the incident, later admitting to police he had taken psychedelic mushrooms and was struggling with depression. Under a plea agreement, he was sentenced in state court to time already served and probation, while prosecutors in the federal case can recommend a one-year prison sentence. The incident forced the flight, carrying 80 passengers, to be diverted.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party conference in Birmingham demonstrates a significant scaling up of the party's operations and ambitions, feeling more like a major party gathering while retaining an insurgent energy. The event's size and professional organization, including corporate sponsors, stand in contrast to its previous, more homespun affairs, reflecting its rapid growth in membership and polling. Party leader Nigel Farage's speech focused on the need for discipline and building a local volunteer network, signaling a serious intent to become a dominant force in British politics. The conference attracted many first-time attendees and former supporters of both the Conservative and Labour parties.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has fallen by more than 80% since the Trump administration eliminated a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The Universal Postal Union reported that the rule change, which requires customs duties on parcels valued under $800, caused a near-halt in the global postal network to the U.S. As a result, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the country due to the new burden of customs collection. The number of such parcels had surged in recent years, from 134 million in 2015 to about 1.4 billion in 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorizing sanctions and other punitive measures against countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the state sponsor of terrorism list, which can trigger penalties like economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the unprecedented action is designed to impose new consequences on governments that use Americans as bargaining chips. According to the Foley Foundation, at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 countries during 2024, highlighting the scale of the issue.</p>

Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, is emerging as a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, known for his vocal opposition to Donald Trump. Having successfully used his personal wealth to bring the Democratic National Convention to Chicago, Pritzker has cultivated an image as a formidable political combatant. The article profiles his political style and ambitions within the national Democratic landscape. His wealth, once making him America's richest politician, has recently been surpassed by President Trump's, a point of political jest for the governor as he continues to build his national profile.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is continuing a government reshuffle, with several ministers moving from the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's shift to the Foreign Office. The changes were prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and are seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda. Key appointments include new ministers at the Home Office to focus on illegal immigration and a new Labour Party chair. The reshuffle also brings new faces into the business and treasury departments, including a successful businessman appointed to the House of Lords to serve as a minister.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile session as investors grappled with conflicting economic signals from the August jobs report. An initial rally, fueled by hopes that weak jobs growth would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, quickly reversed as concerns about a slowing labor market took precedence. Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 22,000, far below expectations, intensifying debate over the economy's health. Despite the intraday swings, major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed to end the week with slight gains, though uncertainty about future Fed policy and economic stability persists.

According to the report, which cited numerous anonymous sources, the civilians were likely diving for shellfish, and the botched mission was never disclosed to Congress.

          <p>Musician Kid Rock is facing backlash after a photo of his private jet, featuring what many described as tacky artwork, circulated on social media. The criticism focused not only on the jet's appearance but also on the significant environmental damage caused by private air travel. Private jets are a potent symbol of wealth inequality and climate indifference, as they produce excessive pollution for short-haul trips that could be made by more sustainable means. Commenters on Reddit condemned the display, with one user stating, "Money cannot buy class," while another called for the outlawing of private jets for celebrities due to their disproportionate carbon footprint.</p>
