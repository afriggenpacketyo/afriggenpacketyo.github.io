          <p>President Trump has demanded the immediate resignation of Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, alleging he is "highly conflicted." The call, made on social media without specific evidence, followed a letter from Senator Tom Cotton raising concerns about Tan's investments and business ties to China, including firms allegedly linked to the Chinese military. The announcement prompted a more than 4% drop in Intel's stock during premarket trading as the market reacted to the political pressure on the major technology company.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot program with France. Under the "one in, one out" agreement, individuals arriving by small boat are eligible for immediate detention and return to France. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of vetted asylum seekers from France through a safe and legal route. The first detentions occurred as 155 migrants arrived on Wednesday, with the government signaling a robust defense against any legal challenges to the new policy.</p>

          <p>Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, are questioning Google and YouTube about their settlement discussions with former President Trump's legal team. The inquiry centers on a lawsuit Trump filed over his social media suspension, with senators expressing concern about a potential "quid-pro-quo" arrangement. They suggest Google might be seeking a favorable settlement to avoid accountability in other federal cases concerning competition and labor laws. This comes as Google faces significant legal challenges, including a major antitrust ruling from the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a method to protect savings from inflation, with top accounts currently offering rates that surpass the inflation rate. The article notes a significant difference between national average CD yields and the higher rates available, particularly from online banks which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of an "inverted yield curve," where short-term CDs presently offer better returns than long-term ones, suggesting a laddering strategy to capitalize on this trend.

          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in the near future to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The announcement follows Trump's statement about the "good chance" of a trilateral summit including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has expressed conditional support. This diplomatic effort comes as a U.S.-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, though Putin has stated a meeting with Zelensky is still "very far" off.</p>

          <p>The recent transfer of Ghislaine Maxwell to a less-secure prison camp has fueled widespread speculation, particularly given its timing. The move occurred shortly after she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously defended Donald Trump, amid scrutiny over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation files. Legal experts suggest the transfer to a more favorable facility could indicate she has provided valuable information to authorities, potentially as part of a cooperation agreement that might foreshadow further benefits.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France, the largest the country has seen since 1949, remains uncontrolled despite having slowed overnight. The blaze has scorched an area larger than Paris, resulting in one death, 13 injuries, and the destruction of dozens of homes, with three people reported missing. Over 2,000 firefighters, supported by aircraft and military personnel, are battling the flames, hoping to contain them soon. Prime Minister François Bayrou has described the event as a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale."</p>

          <p>India has sent its first official delegation to Damascus to meet with Syria's new provisional government, signaling a pragmatic foreign policy shift following the fall of the Assad regime. The outreach aims to understand the new leadership's priorities and ensure India is not excluded from future reconstruction efforts in the war-torn nation. Analysts suggest the move reinforces India's non-aligned stance and protects its strategic interests in regional stability, energy security, and trade corridors, mirroring its pragmatic engagement with the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Toyota, the world's largest carmaker, has cut its annual operating profit forecast by 600 billion yen (over $4 billion), citing the significant impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Although its quarterly results beat estimates, operating profit fell 11% year-on-year, with the company attributing 450 billion yen in losses directly to the tariffs. This highlights the financial pressure on Japanese automakers, who have had to absorb costs to remain competitive in the U.S. market since the 25% vehicle import tariffs were implemented.

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the profound and often overlooked experience of losing a sibling, an event the author experienced as a teenager. The author explores how this loss reshaped her identity, leaving her in a state of being neither a sibling nor an only child, a concept known as "disenfranchised grief." Through personal anecdotes and a compulsion for "private math" to measure the absence, the article delves into the unique nature of the sibling bond, the guilt of unresolved childhood conflicts, and the lifelong process of navigating a future without a key witness to one's past.</p>

The strong performance comes as the company also released new trial data for an experimental obesity pill and braces for potential U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.</p>

          <p>A wide-ranging set of U.S. tariffs, first announced in April, has officially taken effect, impacting more than 90 countries. The move is part of President Trump's broader strategy to reshape global trade, protect American jobs, and exert political pressure. Export-dependent economies in Southeast Asia face some of the highest levies, while some major partners like the UK and Japan negotiated lower rates. The implementation provides some clarity after months of uncertainty, but it comes alongside separate, ongoing tariff threats against India and on foreign-made semiconductors.
