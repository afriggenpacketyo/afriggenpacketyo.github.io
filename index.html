        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a senior administration official, President Trump gave Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth the final order to attack Iranian sites on Saturday after diplomatic efforts, mainly through Steve Witkoff, failed to produce a deal with Iran. The president was reportedly briefed daily on Israel's efforts and the impending operation. Trump remained in close contact with Hegseth while traveling to Bedminster, receiving updates until he made the final decision. This communication highlights the direct involvement and rapid decision-making process of the president in a critical military operation, underscoring the administration's stance on Iran's nuclear ambitions. The article emphasizes the importance of the President's role in national security matters.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a "heightened threat environment" in the United States. While not citing specific current threats, the bulletin anticipates low-level cyber attacks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and potential attacks by Iranian government-affiliated cyber actors. The bulletin also highlights that U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020 and warns that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists, also noting the possibility of violence if Iranian leadership calls for retaliation against the U.S. Law enforcement agencies in New York City are deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Satellite photos reveal the extent of damage inflicted by U.S. military strikes on Iran's Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear facilities, with the mission dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer" utilizing GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators on Fordo and Natanz, and Tomahawk missiles targeting Isfahan. The images show large diameter holes on the ridge above the underground complex at Fordo, as well as blocked tunnel entrances, while Isfahan shows extensive building damage and Natanz displays a crater directly over the underground military complex. General Caine noted that battle damage assessment is pending, while the IAEA reported no increase in off-site radiation levels. These images provide visual confirmation of the operation's impact, though the full extent of the damage remains under assessment.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials shared details of Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history." The operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, supported by decoy B-2s and fighter jets, while a U.S. submarine launched Tomahawk cruise missiles at Isfahan. Gen. Dan Caine said the mission used deception tactics and precision-guided weapons to inflict "extremely severe damage and destruction" on the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan sites, and warned Iran against retaliation. This briefing provides insight into the planning and execution of a complex military operation aimed at dismantling Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Five Phrases to Avoid When Communicating With Children</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, parents who avoid defiance in their children do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, and instead use language that encourages cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," "Stop crying. You're fine," "How many times do I have to tell you?," and "You know better than that" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency, validate emotions, invite problem-solving, and encourage self-reflection. This approach helps children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, which reduces power struggles and fosters emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>Codenamed "Operation Midnight Hammer," the U.S. precision attack on Iran's nuclear facilities was the largest strike using B2 bombers in history and the longest flight involving the fleet since 2001, according to Pentagon officials. The mission involved the first use of Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs (MOPs), with seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers dropping 14 MOPs on the Natanz and Fordo sites, while Tomahawk cruise missiles targeted Isfahan. The operation involved deception tactics, including decoy B-2 bombers, and maintained the element of surprise, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stating that "Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated."

          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a benchmark long sought by the U.S., with Spain initially blocking the measure but ultimately agreeing to an exemption.

At least 3.5% of national GDP will be spent on core military needs, while an additional 1.5% can be allocated for related expenditures.

          <p>Israel announced the recovery of the bodies of three more hostages taken during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, identified as Yonatan Samerano, Ofra Keidar, and Shay Levinson. The Israeli military did not provide details about the operation, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu affirmed Israel's commitment to returning the remaining hostages amid ongoing conflict with Iran. Of the 251 hostages captured on Oct. 7, 50 remain in captivity, with Israel believing 27 of them are dead, this news underscores the ongoing human cost of the conflict and the efforts to account for those still missing.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is ready to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, while warning that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move. Rubio emphasized that the mission was not an attack on the Iranian people, but designed to degrade nuclear sites, and urged Iran to pursue diplomacy. He also affirmed that the U.S. will defend Americans and its bases from Iran and its proxies, while retired Gen. Frank McKenzie said the U.S. would be able to clear the Strait of Hormuz if Iran mined it.</p>

          <p>Iranians express fear and anger after the US bombed three key nuclear sites, with many feeling paralysed and caught by surprise. The strikes occurred just over a week after Israel launched a large-scale air campaign against Iran, with the government restricting internet access and limiting the flow of information. Some Iranians expressed defiance, vowing to stand by their country, while others criticized the leaders of the involved nations. Despite Trump's warning of further attacks, Iran declared that it reserved all options to defend its security, interests, and people.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian authorities have reported no signs of off-site radiation or contamination, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the agency's Director General, stated that no health consequences are expected for people or the environment outside the targeted sites. The three sites hit by U.S. bombs contained nuclear material in the form of uranium enriched to different levels, which is considered to be at the low end of hazard with regard to radioactive materials. Neighboring countries have also reported no abnormal radiation levels.</p>

Jim Himes, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, described the U.S. attacks against Iran as a "massive gamble" by President Donald Trump, citing past U.S. military actions in the region and cautioning against premature applause. Himes expressed concern over the lack of Congressional approval for the strikes, emphasizing Congress's authority to declare war. While acknowledging the possibility of a best-case scenario, he noted the history of U.S. military involvements in the region rarely ending favorably, and described a worst-case scenario involving dead soldiers, hidden nuclear material, and an Iranian device under construction.</p>
