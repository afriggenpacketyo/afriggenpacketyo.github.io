          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to resolve their long-standing border disputes. The meeting, Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurred on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Both leaders emphasized moving relations in a "meaningful direction," focusing on economic development over rivalry and maintaining a peaceful environment at the border following previous deadly clashes in 2020. This rapprochement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two most populous nations and foster regional stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the complex undersea topography of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea could be exploited to create a "submarine kill zone." The plan involves placing intelligent sea mines in "acoustic shadow zones" created by submerged mountains, where sound waves are distorted, making the weapons difficult to detect by sonar. According to the researchers, these sonar dead zones provide ideal hiding spots for underwater weapons. This strategy could enhance China's maritime security and challenge U.S. naval dominance in the contested region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood on social media and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has led to soaring prices and supply shortages. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled in the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its auction price jump 170% this year. The increased demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and labor-intensive production process, which involves shielding tea buds from the sun. Retailers are now rationing supplies, and major companies like Ito En are struggling to secure enough raw materials to meet the booming global appetite.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, they face September, which has historically been the worst-performing month of the year for major stock indices like the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. This follows a strong August where the S&P 500 reached a new record high. While some analysts remain optimistic, citing expectations of an economic soft landing and solid corporate earnings, others are more cautious, pointing to underlying economic pressures. Key economic data, including U.S. non-farm payrolls and EU inflation figures, will be closely watched as markets navigate this traditionally volatile period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire at age 30, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to find ways to make money from a young age. Her early ventures included trading and selling Pokémon cards and colored pencils in elementary school. This hustle evolved into selling virtual items from online games and later creating websites and internet marketing tools. Guo eventually dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, leading to the co-founding of Scale AI, which was acquired by Meta for a valuation of $25 billion.</p>

          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education indicate that students in England who miss school during the first week of the academic year are significantly more likely to be persistently absent later on. The data showed that 57% of pupils who were partially absent in the first week of September 2024 went on to miss at least 10% of the school year. In contrast, only 14% of students with full attendance in the first week became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat this problem.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights similarities between the media strategies of former U.S. President Donald Trump and the UK's Reform party, particularly following a Nottinghamshire council's decision to ban local reporters. The analysis suggests that, like Trump, Reform leader Nigel Farage may be adopting a playbook of shutting out critical media outlets to control the narrative and rally support by positioning the press as an establishment foil. This trend reflects a broader moment where some right-wing politicians feel they can bypass traditional media without electoral consequence, though the article notes such tactics may not be as effective in the UK's distinct political culture.</p>

The win was marred by another goalkeeping error, this time from Altay Bayindir, following similar mistakes in previous matches.

The defense struggled with missed tackles and failed to pressure Utah's quarterback, who accounted for nearly 300 yards of offense. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava had limited success, and the running game was largely ineffective. The lopsided defeat was a stark reality check for a team that had kept its preseason training camp largely private, raising early concerns about the team's competitiveness under coach DeShaun Foster.</p>

          <p>This article provides a biographical overview of Alix Tichelman, who was charged with manslaughter in the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. The case came to light after security footage from Hayes' yacht, the "Escape," showed Tichelman with him on the night he died. The profile traces her background from her childhood in Canada to her time in Atlanta, where her then-boyfriend also died of an overdose just months before the incident with Hayes. Tichelman was ultimately arrested in a police sting after being lured to a hotel under the pretense of meeting a client from a "sugar daddy" website.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed plans for a new Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the company of being complicit in federal immigration raids. The opposition follows a recent raid near a Westlake Home Depot, one of several targeting day laborers and vendors in the store's vicinity. Jurado stated that Home Depot's silence on the issue makes it complicit in what she described as acts of terror against the community. In response, a Home Depot spokesperson said the company is not notified of planned ICE operations and is required to follow all federal and local regulations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights ahead of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The order, largely symbolic, seeks to prevent city police from assisting federal operations and urges federal agents to wear clear identification and refrain from using masks. The move comes amid reports of a possible major federal enforcement effort in the city. The mayor stated the initiative is designed to prevent families from being "ripped apart" and to uphold Chicagoans' constitutional rights against what he termed "militarized activity."</p>

          <p>An in-depth article details the case of Dino Guglielmelli, a millionaire supplement company owner who was convicted of attempted murder for trying to hire a hitman to kill his estranged wife, model Monica Olsen. The plot was uncovered when the man he approached, Rick Fuhrmann, went to the police instead. Fuhrmann then wore a wire, recording Guglielmelli confirming his desire to have Olsen killed for a fee of $80,000. Guglielmelli ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to nine years in prison, claiming he was manipulated by Fuhrmann, though the audio evidence proved damning.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans began their football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State, marking the team's highest point total since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, never punting and recording three plays of over 60 yards, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. While the performance was dominant, it came against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent, making it a smooth but perhaps not fully revealing start to the season.</p>
