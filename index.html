        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An economic think tank, NIESR, warns that UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves must implement "a moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to address a projected £41.2 billion shortfall in public finances. The report suggests this is necessary for her to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules, which include debt falling as a share of national income. The government faces a difficult choice between its spending commitments, its pledge to avoid tax hikes on workers, and its borrowing limits, with NIESR recommending tax reform to ensure stability and reassure investors.

          <p>China's initiative to control high-risk local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of 12 high-debt jurisdictions. The region's exit was confirmed in a local budget review, signaling progress in Beijing's two-year plan to restructure and manage financial liabilities at the provincial level. This development is significant as the region, a major coal and energy producer, had previously halted major infrastructure projects like a subway due to financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the immense difficulty athletes from other sports, like Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit, face when trying to transition into the National Football League. Key obstacles include the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying law, and the sheer depth of athletic talent available in the U.S. The "planet theory" is also cited, suggesting that while uniquely large linemen are highly sought after, skill positions like running back have an abundance of elite athletes, making it incredibly competitive to secure a roster spot.</p>

While both hosts appear, the episodes have been edited to reduce their on-screen banter, and one contestant was removed at her own request following the controversy surrounding the presenters' behavior.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian's readers' editor examines the ethical debate sparked by the publication of a powerful photograph showing a severely malnourished 18-month-old boy in Gaza. The controversy arose after it was revealed the child had pre-existing medical conditions, leading to accusations that the image was misleadingly presented as solely a case of famine. The columnist defends the publication, arguing that children with underlying health issues are the most vulnerable in a hunger crisis and that the image accurately depicted real suffering, even if the full context was not known initially.</p>

          <p>Driven by a burgeoning domestic coffee culture and a zero-tariff policy for certain African nations, China is actively securing new coffee supply chains from the continent. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are leading this push, signing agreements in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to procure thousands of tons of beans and invest in local processing facilities. This strategy aims to "lock in supply" to meet surging consumer demand in China while also leveraging global trade uncertainties to build stronger economic ties with African coffee-producing countries.</p>

While bilateral trade is minimal, analysts say the move sends a symbolic message and threatens to hinder the war-torn nation's desperately needed reconstruction efforts. Observers suggest the tariff could be a form of political leverage, intended to keep the new Syrian government on a "leash" and potentially pressure it on issues like normalizing relations with Israel, creating further instability for the fragile state.

          <p>A new national poll indicates that a significant portion of Latino voters who supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election may not vote for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterms. The survey, conducted by Equis, found that only 27% of respondents would vote for a Republican candidate, a sharp drop from the 45% who reported voting for Trump. This suggests a shaky political alignment and a potential challenge for the GOP, which is counting on sustained Latino support to achieve its electoral goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced that the state correctional facility in Norco will close by fall 2026, citing a declining statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The medium-security prison, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release anyone early; instead, inmates and staff will be transferred to other facilities. The closure has sparked local hope that the site, which was originally a luxury resort hotel in the 1920s, could be redeveloped and restored to its former glory.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight Committee investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The bipartisan committee is seeking information as part of its probe into the federal government's handling of the Epstein case, especially after the Trump administration decided against releasing more files. The subpoenas cite previously reported trips Bill Clinton took on Epstein's private plane and other connections as the basis for seeking their testimony, with depositions scheduled for this fall.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for the incarcerated Ghislaine Maxwell are formally opposing the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case, arguing it would violate her due process rights while her appeal is pending. The lawyers claim the material is untested, hearsay-laden, and that Maxwell has become a scapegoat for Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. This legal maneuvering comes as the DOJ seeks to release the records, which it notes contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers and information that was largely made public during the trial.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy advisors regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a goal for the "household consumption rate"—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand from its current low levels. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, arguing that such a metric is not operationally feasible as a direct policy goal, highlighting differing views on how to best stimulate China's economy.

          <p>Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, who had an underwhelming start to the season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury, is showing encouraging signs of a comeback. The Japanese phenom has been progressing in his throwing program, with his fastball velocity increasing and his command improving, and has even added a new two-seam fastball. The team is hopeful that a healthy and refined Sasaki could return by late August and potentially become a valuable asset for their pitching staff during their postseason push.</p>

Over 1,900 personnel are battling the fire, but officials warn that a warming and drying trend expected later in the week could increase fire behavior and hamper containment efforts.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, announced it has disabled more than 6.8 million accounts in the first half of the year as part of a crackdown on global scam operations. Many of the targeted accounts were linked to criminal centers in Southeast Asia that use fraudulent investment schemes and other tactics to deceive users, often employing forced labor. In response, WhatsApp is rolling out new security features, such as alerts when a user is added to a group chat by an unknown contact, to better protect people from these scams.</p>
