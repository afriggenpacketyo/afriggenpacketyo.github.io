          <p>Donald Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs marks a significant shift away from globalization, alarming many economists and international partners. The article details Trump's long-held belief in tariffs as a tool to revitalize the US economy and generate revenue, dating back to the 1980s. It contrasts Trump's optimistic predictions of a new Golden Age with the skepticism of economists who warn of potential economic disruption, increased costs for American consumers, and retaliatory measures from other countries. The piece provides historical context, noting the potential risks of repeating protectionist policies like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a powerful vaccine booster, termed SABER, that significantly enhances immune responses against cancer and viral infections. This innovative system acts as a molecular "elevator," efficiently delivering vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum within cells, bypassing cellular barriers. The research highlights the potential for improved treatments for malignancies and more effective vaccines against rapidly mutating viruses like coronaviruses. This advancement represents a significant step forward in vaccine delivery technology and its potential to combat major global health challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs have taken effect, imposing a 10% levy on imports from numerous countries and higher rates on goods from major trading partners. This move marks a significant departure from the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates, causing widespread concern in global markets. The tariffs are expected to impact businesses and consumers, with potential price increases and disruptions to supply chains, though some sectors have been granted exemptions. The international community is closely watching how these tariffs will evolve and whether negotiations will lead to lower rates.</p>
