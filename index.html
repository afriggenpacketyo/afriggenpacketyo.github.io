          <h2>Chinese Researchers Achieve Quantum Code Breakthrough</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 08:08:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao, has achieved a significant breakthrough in quantum cryptology by successfully factoring a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer, an accomplishment previously considered impossible. This advancement raises concerns about the potential for quantum computers to decipher even the most secure encryption, posing a threat to data security and personal privacy. The development has intensified the global race to develop quantum technologies and countermeasures like post-quantum cryptography, aimed at staying ahead of the looming threat to data security. The breakthrough adds momentum to the debate surrounding Q-Day, the hypothetical point when quantum computers could crack any code.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwich City has sacked head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup following a series of defeats and has appointed former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as interim manager for the remaining two games of the season. The decision was made after Norwich lost six of their last eight Championship matches, leaving them in 14th place. Sporting director Ben Knapper stated the change was necessary due to recent results and performances, despite having a long-term focus when Thorup was initially appointed. Wilshere, who previously managed Arsenal's under-18 team, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking the first such signal since the early stages of the war. Putin's comments followed Zelensky's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire on civilian targets, an idea the Kremlin stated it would "analyze." Meanwhile, Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities continue, including a hit on an apartment block in Zaporizhzhia, prompting Zelensky to demand a "clear answer from Moscow" regarding a cessation of attacks on civilian infrastructure. Ukraine is also set to participate in talks with the U.S. and European countries in London to discuss pathways to end the war.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Education Department will restart collecting defaulted student loans next month, ending a pandemic-era leniency period. Starting May 5th, the department will begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, withholding government payments, and will also begin garnishing wages after a 30-day notice. Roughly 5.3 million borrowers are currently in default, with millions more behind on payments. Advocates criticize the decision, citing borrower confusion due to changing student loan policies between administrations and ongoing issues with income-driven repayment programs.</p>

          <p>China's Politburo is expected to hold a meeting to discuss how to respond to intensified tariffs from the US. Analysts predict that the Politburo will likely focus on implementing existing policy tools rather than introducing a new round of fiscal stimulus. Urgent problems arising from the trade conflict are expected to be a priority, along with potential monetary easing measures in the second quarter. The focus will likely be on swiftly implementing existing stimulus measures.</p>

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned to withstand tariffs due to its domestic production, with 80% of its products manufactured in the United States. This gives the company a competitive advantage, as it avoids import tariffs and can maintain stable prices and profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility in Ohio allows for quick consumer response and minimizes the need for discounts.

          <p>Personal finance expert Suze Orman advises retirees to maintain a cash cushion of three to five years' worth of living expenses in a liquid, low-risk account to protect against market downturns. Orman suggests that retirees should not rely solely on 401(k)s or IRAs, as the stock market can be unpredictable. This cash reserve should not be tied to the market, allowing retirees to cover essential expenses without being forced to sell investments at a loss. According to a 2022 Federal Reserve survey, the average American household has saved approximately $333,000 for retirement.</p>

However, policing minister Diana Johnson contends that the plan is unworkable and would hinder the police's ability to monitor serious antisemitism and other racist incidents.

          <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has agreed to pay $300 million to settle claims that it illegally filled millions of invalid prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The Justice Department alleged that Walgreens pharmacists knowingly filled prescriptions with clear signs of illegitimacy and pressured workers to fill prescriptions quickly without proper protocols. The settlement resolves allegations that Walgreens violated the Controlled Substances Act and the False Claims Act. Walgreens denies liability but will dismiss a declaratory judgment action filed in Texas.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Southeast Asian immigrants in Los Angeles and Orange counties are being detained and deported at routine ICE check-ins. These immigrants, who have had deportation orders on hold for years, are now facing enforcement as the Trump administration seeks to increase deportations. The targeted immigrants are generally those who were convicted of crimes after arriving in the U.S. and had been allowed to remain in the country under the condition of regular check-ins with ICE.</p>
