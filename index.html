          <p>Two individuals responding to a brush fire in a mountain community near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, have been shot and killed. Officials confirmed the victims were firefighters and that law enforcement was actively taking sniper fire from at least one high-powered rifle. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office has urged residents to avoid the area as the situation is ongoing, and it remains unclear how many shooters or total casualties there are. Idaho's governor described the incident as a heinous and direct assault on the state's first responders.</p>

This action is part of a broader trend under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government has adopted increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community, creating a hostile environment that human rights groups warn leads to more discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>The quest to find the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, which was declared extinct nearly 40 years ago, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. While enthusiasts scour the wilderness with trail cameras, a separate, high-tech effort is underway to bring the animal back through de-extinction. A lab at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with an American bioscience company, is using genetic engineering to try and recreate the thylacine genome from its closest living relative, the dunnart.</p>

          <p>Brigham Young University quarterback Jake Retzlaff is reportedly entering the transfer portal in anticipation of a seven-game suspension for an honor code violation. The disciplinary action follows a sexual assault allegation against him, which he denies. In a legal filing, Retzlaff acknowledged having a consensual sexual encounter with his accuser; premarital sex is a violation of the strict honor code enforced by the university, which is run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>

          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Barry, has formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and is heading toward the country's northeast coast. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for the region, anticipating that Barry will make landfall late Sunday or early Monday. While the storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland, it poses a significant threat of heavy rainfall, which could lead to dangerous flooding and mudslides across several Mexican states.</p>

          <p>UK punk duo Bob Vylan has drawn widespread condemnation after leading chants of "death, death to the IDF" during their performance at the Glastonbury Festival. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with festival organizers, labeled the comments "appalling hate speech" and an incitement to violence. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, issued an on-screen warning for discriminatory language and has confirmed the performance will not be made available on its iPlayer streaming service. Police are now reviewing footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <h2>Vin Diesel Suggests Paul Walker's Character Could Return for 'Fast & Furious' Finale</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 17:18:47 EDT</div>

          <p>Vin Diesel revealed that the final film in the "Fast & Furious" saga, planned for an April 2027 release, intends to feature the return of Brian O'Conner, the character played by the late Paul Walker. Walker passed away in 2013, and his character was given an emotional farewell in "Furious 7" through a combination of digital effects, archival footage, and stand-in work by his brothers. This potential posthumous return has reignited discussions about the ethics and use of digital likenesses for deceased actors in major film franchises.</p>
