            <p>British Royal Air Force Typhoon jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace near Poland in separate incidents. The intercepts, part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, involved a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M intelligence aircraft and an unidentified plane leaving Kaliningrad airspace. This mission, named Operation Chessman, highlights the UK's commitment to NATO and its ability to work alongside Sweden, NATO's newest member, to defend the alliance's airspace. The UK's increased defence spending reflects its dedication to reassuring allies and deterring adversaries amidst growing Russian aggression. Optimism remains high because of the quick response to a potential threat.</p>

            <p>Evangelical leaders are actively working to reclaim the phrase "Christ is King" from far-right and far-left groups who are attempting to weaponize it for hateful purposes. The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) has tracked the misuse of the phrase by extremist influencers and bot networks, some with connections to the Chinese Communist Party. Evangelical leaders emphasize that the phrase is a Christian expression of worship and should not be used to spread hate, particularly against Jewish people, highlighting the importance of Judeo-Christian unity.

These companies' actual performance data, rather than surveys or polls, provide a more accurate reflection of the economy's health.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The author suggests that China should require bilateral trade with the U.S. to be settled in renminbi as a countermeasure to Trump's tariffs. This would significantly strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar. By forcing the U.S. to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, it would increase demand and push up the exchange rate. This move could also signal strong economic fundamentals to global investors, encouraging capital inflows to China and outflows from the U.S.</p>
