          <p>Israel's defense minister has vowed retaliation against Iran following a fourth day of escalating missile exchanges between the two nations. Iranian media reports indicate that Tehran's strikes targeted Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa, potentially impacting Israel's energy infrastructure. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard claims to have disrupted Israeli defense systems using innovative methods, while Israel relies heavily on its Iron Dome missile defense. Investors are closely monitoring the conflict's potential to disrupt Middle Eastern oil supplies and shipping lanes, though markets initially showed resilience before concerns regarding economic instability caused some investors to be wary. Optimism is tempered by the potential for further escalation and broader regional instability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has endorsed Rep. Abe Hamadeh, R-Ariz., for reelection, praising him as an "America First Patriot." Trump had previously endorsed Hamadeh ahead of the 2024 GOP primary in Arizona's 8th Congressional District. Hamadeh recently introduced a resolution to limit the types of flags displayed in House facilities, allowing only the American flag, state flags, and flags of visiting foreign dignitaries. This endorsement and Hamadeh's legislative efforts align with Trump's broader political agenda. The endorsement signals strong support for Hamadeh within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the perceived lack of independence among Republican members of Congress, who are described as consistently aligning with Donald Trump's demands. The author argues that these legislators are behaving more like members of parliament, taking cues from the executive branch rather than exercising their constitutional duty to check its power. Examples include voting for deficit-increasing measures after previously opposing them and supporting Trump's policies despite private reservations. The piece questions why these lawmakers do not speak out against what the author considers moral rot, highlighting the potential consequences for their careers and livelihoods if they dissent.</p>

          <p>New guidelines at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals may allow doctors to refuse treatment to unmarried veterans and Democrats, citing President Trump's executive order on "gender ideology extremism." The changes remove language prohibiting discrimination based on politics and marital status, raising concerns among medical experts about potential discrimination. VA officials claim the changes are a formality to comply with federal law, but critics argue they could harm female and LGBTQ+ veterans, particularly in rural areas.

          <p>Amid increased immigration enforcement raids, experts recommend that foreign-born residents, particularly undocumented immigrants, take steps to protect their financial assets. Key steps include collecting and securing important documents, checking access to accounts, establishing a power of attorney, and protecting finances for future generations. Organizations like the Appleseed Network and the Financial Planning Association offer resources and assistance to help families prepare for potential detention or deportation. Planning ahead can help ensure that assets are managed effectively and that loved ones are protected in worst-case scenarios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prestige television shows are increasingly employing the "oner," or one-shot technique, to enhance storytelling and create immersive experiences. Shows like "True Detective" and "The Bear" have used oners to great effect, and Emmy contenders this year are pushing the technique further with grueling fight scenes, trippy mind warps, and documentary-style realism. Technological advancements and skilled direction are making oners more accessible, but the key to success is ensuring the style serves the story rather than overshadowing it. The use of oners reflects a trend toward more ambitious and visually dynamic television production.</p>

Sheinbaum has defended immigrants' rights to protest but faces accusations of encouraging violence, putting her in a delicate position. News coverage in Mexico has largely sided with the immigrants, condemning U.S. actions. The controversy is fueled by the proliferation of Mexican flags at the protests and Sheinbaum's calls for mobilization against a proposed U.S. tax on remittances.

          <p>California officials are concerned that federal budget cuts, particularly within the U.S. Forest Service, will hinder wildfire prevention efforts in the state. These cuts, driven by the White House advisory team, DOGE, have led to significant staff reductions, impacting the logistics and regulatory processes required for prescribed burns. With the federal government owning a majority of California's forests, state officials worry that these cuts will compromise the ability to manage and reduce wildfire risks.

          <p>Despite ongoing challenges and criticisms, California remains committed to its high-speed rail project, driven by issues such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and climate change. The project aims to connect major urban centers, stimulate economic development in the Central Valley, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While facing budget overruns and delays, proponents argue that the long-term benefits, including time savings and reduced highway construction costs, justify the effort. The author suggests considering a National Infrastructure Bank to finance such projects and emphasizes California's history of innovation and determination in overcoming obstacles.</p>

          <p>The Enhanced Games, an upcoming Olympic-style competition, is generating controversy by openly encouraging the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). Founded by Aron D'Souza, the games aim to "redefine superhumanity through science" and offer substantial financial rewards, including $1 million for breaking world records. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has condemned the initiative, while others argue it highlights the failures of current anti-doping efforts. The Enhanced Games are scheduled to take place in Las Vegas in 2026, challenging the traditional values of clean sport and raising ethical concerns about athlete health.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 subvariant, nicknamed "Nimbus," is spreading in California, characterized by "razor blade throat" symptoms. The subvariant is increasingly dominant nationally, comprising an estimated 37% of coronavirus samples. California is seeing indicators of increased COVID-19 activity, including rising coronavirus levels in wastewater and an uptick in test positivity rates. This increase coincides with concerns about the Trump administration's recent moves on vaccine policy, which some experts fear will make it more difficult for people to get vaccinated. Experts recommend continued vigilance and vaccination efforts to mitigate the potential impact of the new subvariant.</p>

While some of Musk's initial plans have faced legal challenges, many DOGE staffers have been converted to full-time federal employees, and agencies are adopting DOGE-inspired cost-cutting measures. The effort is aimed at prioritizing efficiency and aligning government operations with the administration's vision, but concerns remain about potential impacts on privacy and public services.</p>

          <p>The farming industry is grappling with the impact of increased immigration enforcement, despite initial expectations of a reprieve. Recent raids on farms and meatpacking plants have heightened concerns about labor shortages and disruptions to the food supply chain. While President Trump has expressed support for agricultural workers, other administration officials maintain that anyone without legal status must leave. The industry is seeking changes to visa programs to address labor needs, but faces challenges in navigating the current political climate.</p>

          <h2>Philp Alleges Authorities Covered Up Grooming Gangs</h2>

          <p>Chris Philp has accused police and councils of deliberately covering up grooming gang crimes, prioritizing "race relations" over protecting vulnerable girls. The shadow home secretary also claims the prime minister was reluctant to announce a national inquiry until pressured by Baroness Casey's report into child sexual exploitation. These accusations raise serious concerns about institutional failures and the need for greater accountability in addressing child sexual exploitation.</p>
