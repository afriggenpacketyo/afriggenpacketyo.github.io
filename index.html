          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old famed value investor, announced his plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed from a failing textile manufacturer. Buffett's value investing approach, focusing on buying wonderful businesses at fair prices, influenced generations of financiers and promoted long-term investing. Under his leadership, Berkshire acquired numerous successful businesses and insurers, amassing a personal fortune of about $168 billion and earning him millions of admirers. His successor, Gregory Abel, is regarded as an excellent operator of businesses and a savvy deal maker, but some investors worry that the company will become less special without Buffett's stock-picking prowess.

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen by the Houthi militia struck near Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, causing a temporary suspension of flights and mild injuries to several people. Israel's military stated it attempted to intercept the missile, but failed, leading to a review of defense systems. Prime Minister Netanyahu, agreeing with President Trump's sentiment, threatened retaliation against both the Houthis and Iran, accusing Iran of backing the attacks. Opposition leaders criticized the government's failure to prevent the missile strikes, as the airport resumed operations an hour later, though some airlines cancelled flights.</p>

Ruud, a leading clay-courter, acknowledged Draper's talent and predicted he would become a significant threat on clay. Draper's strong serving and forehand were key to his success in the tournament, but Ruud's experience and physicality ultimately secured him the victory.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite calling for lower interest rates. Trump believes Powell's reluctance to lower rates stems from personal dislike, but acknowledged he will soon have the opportunity to appoint a replacement. Trump emphasized the need for lower interest rates to boost the economy, but ruled out immediate action against Powell, despite their differing views. The President feels that the current economic conditions warrant a decrease in interest rates.</p>

The sign, which read "f--- the Jews," was held up by bottle-services waitresses, prompting Portnoy to vow to "ruin" the people involved. He said he was working to identify the individuals responsible and ensure there are consequences for their actions, and that the two bottle girls who were at the bar had been fired.

The project, now aiming for a 171-mile route between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033, has faced challenges in acquiring land and navigating complex agricultural landscapes.

Supporters claim it provides educational freedom, while Democrats argue it hurts public schools by diverting funds to wealthier families already in private schools.

          <p>Iran's Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh stated that Tehran would retaliate if the United States or Israel initiated an attack. The statement followed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vow to respond to a Houthi missile strike near Israel's main airport. Nasirzadeh said that U.S. bases in the region would be considered targets in case of an attack, but maintained that Iran has "no hostility toward neighbouring countries". He also echoed Iran's official stance, that Houthis act upon their own motivations.</p>

          <p>José Murguía Santiago, the mayor of Teuchitlán, Mexico, was arrested as part of an investigation into a suspected drug cartel training camp. The camp, located on the Izaguirre Ranch, allegedly used the ranch to train newly recruited gunmen, and the investigation was spurred by human remains and clothing being found. The investigation is looking into possible omissions or complicity of authorities with the Jalisco New Generation cartel, and a police chief from a neighboring municipality and two of his officers were also arrested.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's actions in his second term reflect a broader tradition of right-wing thought favoring monarchical and dictatorial rule, drawing from theorists like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss. The author contends that Trump's administration is consolidating executive power, disregarding the separation of powers, and asserting a near-permanent state of emergency. The piece warns that this expansive view of executive power threatens to transform the American presidency into a dictatorial office.</p>

Police claim the son, Ryan Hinton, brandished a gun at officers during a stolen vehicle investigation, prompting the shooting.

          <p>Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson is expected to plead guilty to federal public corruption charges, including wire fraud and theft involving public funds. In exchange, prosecutors are dropping four other charges, and will ask for a reduced sentence of one year and one day in prison, as well as restitution of $13,000. The charges stem from allegations that she awarded a bonus to a relative working in her office, with the understanding that a portion of the money would be returned to her to pay an ethics fine.</p>

          <p>Following Saúl Álvarez's uninspiring fight against William Scull, questions arise about his upcoming match against Terence Crawford, which is scheduled for September. Despite Crawford's impressive boxing record, concerns persist that the weight difference will make the fight unequal, similar to previous matchups in Álvarez's career. Crawford will have to move up two divisions to face Álvarez, and some experts suggest Crawford is only taking the fight for the financial reward, which may lead to an unexciting and one-sided contest.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate against the Houthis after a missile struck near Israel's main airport. The missile, fired from Yemen by the Iran-backed group, injured several people, and prompted Netanyahu to declare that Israel would respond to both the Houthis and Iran. Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, echoed this sentiment, promising a stronger response. The Houthi military spokesperson claimed the Israeli airport was "no longer safe for air travel."</p>
