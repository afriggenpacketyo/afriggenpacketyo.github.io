        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Heavy rains from the remnants of Tropical Storm Mario triggered severe mudslides and flash flooding east of Los Angeles. A two-year-old boy tragically drowned after the vehicle he was in was swept away by floodwaters in Barstow; his father was rescued. The intense storm, which dropped nearly two inches of rain in two hours, also trapped numerous drivers on mountain roads and caused significant damage to homes in communities like Forest Falls. This area is particularly vulnerable due to recent wildfire burn scars that reduce the soil's ability to absorb water, exacerbating the flood's destructive impact.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, intended to ease borrowing costs, has paradoxically caused long-term rates, including mortgages, to increase. While the stock market reacted positively, bond traders sold off long-term bonds, driving their yields higher amid concerns that the Fed might be underestimating persistent inflation. This market reaction highlights a disconnect between the central bank's monetary policy and investor sentiment regarding long-term economic stability and inflation risks. The development has immediate implications for consumers, as rising mortgage rates could further pressure the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Corporate travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker "NAVN." The company, formerly known as TripActions, reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months, serving over 10,000 customers including major corporations like Unilever and Adobe. This move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen the most activity since the 2021 boom, with investors showing strong appetite for tech and AI-related companies. Navan aims to disrupt the legacy business travel sector with its integrated "super app" and proprietary AI framework. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned following intense pressure from President Donald Trump. The resignation came after Siebert's office concluded there was insufficient evidence to criminally charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, a prominent political rival of the president. Trump publicly stated "I want him out" and later claimed he fired Siebert, criticizing the prosecutor's failure to secure an indictment against James. This event raises significant concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice and the erosion of its traditional independence from the White House.</p>

The move comes as Workday, under new CEO Carl Eschenbach, announced a multiyear plan to enhance shareholder value, including a $5 billion share buyback and measures to expand profit margins. Elliott has publicly expressed support for Workday's new management and strategic direction, suggesting a collaborative engagement rather than a hostile takeover.

          <p>The recent Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight, won by Crawford, serves as a cornerstone for a larger strategic plan by Saudi Arabia's Turki al-Sheikh and TKO Group to dominate professional boxing. The article details how their new venture, Zuffa Boxing, aims to create a UFC-style league, centralizing control and moving away from the fragmented model of multiple sanctioning bodies. This initiative is backed by enormous Saudi investment, which has already altered the sport's economics, drawing criticism for stifling dissent and controlling the media narrative. The plan also involves lobbying for changes to U.S. law, specifically the Muhammad Ali Act, to favor their centralized promotional model.</p>

          <p>An ongoing and intensifying drought in Vermont is placing immense strain on the state's dairy farmers, a cornerstone of the regional economy. The lack of rain has stunted the growth of essential feed crops like corn and alfalfa, forcing farmers to spend thousands on supplemental feed and, in some cases, haul water for their cattle. With 80% of the state now in a severe or extreme drought and soil moisture far below average, farmers are facing significant financial losses. While state officials are monitoring the situation, the threshold for federal disaster assistance has not yet been met, leaving farmers to adapt to increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather patterns on their own.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The administration frames the move as a way to prevent "abuse" of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers, forcing companies to evaluate if a foreign employee is valuable enough to justify the steep cost. The order, which applies to new requests, has drawn concern from tech industry groups and immigration lawyers, who argue it will stifle innovation and price out smaller businesses and startups.

The raids have disrupted key sectors of the economy like agriculture and construction, causing economic harm and alienating Latino voters, thereby undermining the president's own agenda. The negative consequences have even prompted some Republican state legislators in California to call for a more nuanced approach, focusing on deporting criminals rather than essential workers. The author suggests that the clear economic and social costs of the current strategy are creating a new, albeit reluctant, opening for a bipartisan conversation on reform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly paused a $400 million weapons aid package to Taiwan, fueling fears that the island's security is being used as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China. The reported halt on lethal munitions and drones came just before a phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where they discussed making progress on trade and other issues. While the pause could be reversed, it represents a significant shift from the previous increase in arms sales to Taiwan. Analysts worry this tactical concession could create an opportunity for Beijing to pressure Taiwan, which relies heavily on U.S. support to deter a potential Chinese invasion.</p>

          <p>Deep divisions have emerged within the UK's new left-wing political movement, "Your Party," as MP Zarah Sultana accuses former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and other senior members of "baseless attacks" on her character. The dispute centers on a membership portal launched by Sultana, which Corbyn and his allies claimed was "unauthorised," urging supporters to cancel any payments. Sultana, who has instructed defamation lawyers, alleges she has been sidelined by a "sexist boys' club." The public row reveals significant internal conflict over control and finances within the fledgling party before it has even held its founding conference.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with "sanctuary" states, threatening lawsuits and funding cuts against California, New York, and Illinois for their refusal to fully cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states honor immigration detainers, which are requests to hold individuals for federal agents after their scheduled release from local custody. The states, citing laws that limit such cooperation to protect community trust, have largely refused. The DHS now intends to involve the Department of Justice to sue the states, intensifying the federal-state battle over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>At least 14 people were killed in overnight Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, according to Palestinian health officials. One strike on a home killed six members of the same family, who were relatives of the director of Shifa Hospital. The attacks come as Israel intensifies its military offensive in the city and continues to urge hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians sheltering there to evacuate to a designated "humanitarian zone" in the south. Aid organizations have warned that another mass displacement will worsen the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and famine conditions already present in northern Gaza, and are calling for an urgent ceasefire.</p>

The incident occurred Friday afternoon when multiple rounds were fired at the building, striking a window but causing no injuries. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation. The station's parent company, Tegna, confirmed all employees were safe and that they are cooperating with law enforcement. The event drew condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which stated that "any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on our democracy itself."</p>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the Nazi party's exploitation of the 1933 Reichstag fire and the Trump administration's response to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The author argues that, just as Hitler used the fire as a pretext to suspend civil liberties and crush political opposition, the current administration is using Kirk's death to blame the entire political left and justify a broad crackdown on dissent. The piece cites threats against media, investigations into non-profits, and calls to designate "antifa" as terrorists as evidence of an authoritarian playbook. It warns that while U.S. democracy is more established than Weimar Germany's, the current moment is dangerously similar.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the tendency on both the political left and right to quickly frame the motive of Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, to fit a preferred narrative. Initially, many on the left circulated a theory that Robinson was a far-right extremist who found Kirk insufficiently radical, a narrative that lacked strong evidence. However, newly released charging documents suggest Robinson's motivations were rooted in left-leaning ideals, citing his pro-LGBTQ+ views and statements that Kirk "spreads too much hate." The author argues this episode illustrates a universal impulse toward comforting, ideologically convenient fictions and urges progressives to guard against their own biases.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang offers a novel framework for understanding the dynamic between the U.S. and China, characterizing it as a competition between a "lawyerly society" and an "engineering state." Wang argues that China's leadership, dominated by engineers, has prioritized physical dynamism, leading to rapid infrastructure development and manufacturing prowess. In contrast, he suggests America's governing class of lawyers has led to a focus on procedure that can result in physical stagnation. While acknowledging China's own significant problems, such as high youth unemployment, Wang provocatively suggests the U.S. could learn from China's successes in building and industrial policy.</p>

The incident is the second time this month a NATO member has invoked Article 4 due to Russian actions, escalating tensions and prompting calls for a stronger, more unified response from the alliance to what Estonia's foreign minister described as a pattern of Russian provocations.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but remain over open water for the next several days. The storm's current projected track takes it north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, it could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is remembered as the greatest pitcher of his generation and the central figure who guided the franchise through difficult times, including a bankruptcy period, to its current era of sustained success. His career includes three Cy Young awards and a legacy of consistent excellence, holding the lowest ERA of any pitcher in the last 100 years with a comparable number of innings. His departure is seen as the end of an era, though he leaves the team in a strong position, having just clinched its 13th consecutive postseason berth.</p>
