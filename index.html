          <p>Tokyo is bolstering its defenses against extreme flooding with the Metropolitan Outer Area Underground Discharge Channel, one of the world's largest stormwater discharge mechanisms. This subterranean channel protects Tokyo and surrounding areas from heavy rain inundation. The facility is open for tours, offering visitors a glimpse into a cavernous space reminiscent of an ancient Roman temple. The channel plays a vital role in mitigating flood damage, especially as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of severe weather events in the region.</p>

This innovative approach aims to understand the voles' habitat use, enabling targeted conservation efforts such as removing invasive species and protecting riverbanks.

          <p>A downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, combined with concerns about government debt, is causing unease in financial markets. The downgrade reflects worries about President Trump's tax policies and their potential impact on the federal deficit. The move has led to declines in stock futures and a weakening of the U.S. dollar. Analysts suggest the downgrade could challenge the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds and increase borrowing costs for the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>
