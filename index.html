          <h2>Goldman Sachs Economist Reports Early AI Impact on Young Tech Workers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 14:07:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, generative AI is already affecting the labor market, with the initial impact concentrated on younger tech workers. While widespread AI adoption is still pending, data shows a recent pullback in tech hiring that has disproportionately increased unemployment for employees aged 20 to 30. This trend is attributed to companies pausing junior-level hiring as they begin to integrate AI, which can automate many routine tasks. The analysis suggests that while the full effects are yet to be seen, this displacement of young workers is a concrete early sign of AI's broader economic transformation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly refuted claims from China that its AI data center chips, specifically the H20 model designed for the Chinese market, contain a "kill switch" or backdoor for remote deactivation. In a blog post, the company's chief security officer stated that such features would violate cybersecurity principles and harm U.S. national security interests. This denial comes as Nvidia navigates complex geopolitical tensions and U.S. export controls aimed at preventing China from using advanced AI for military purposes. The company emphasized that secret backdoors are dangerous vulnerabilities that could be exploited by any attacker.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, despite legal challenges and concerns over his implanted heart defibrillator. Witnesses reported that Black expressed being in significant pain shortly after the lethal injection began, raising questions about whether the device caused him to be shocked during the procedure. His attorneys had argued for the device to be deactivated to prevent unnecessary suffering, but a court overturned the initial order. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters, and his execution proceeded despite his declining health and claims of intellectual disability.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and numerous former attorneys general and FBI directors as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan effort seeks depositions and documents to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. This move follows the Justice Department's recent conclusion that it would not release further information, a decision that has drawn criticism and fueled demands for greater transparency. The committee aims to use its findings to inform potential legislative reforms.</p>

          <p>During a game between the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox, benches cleared after an exchange between Astros pitcher Hector Neris and the Red Sox third base coach, seemingly over sign-stealing paranoia. After the game, Neris suggested the Red Sox might have been stealing signs, prompting a pointed on-air comment from a Red Sox announcer and former player. The announcer highlighted the irony of the Astros, who were at the center of a major sign-stealing scandal that helped them win the 2017 World Series, being upset about the practice. The incident underscores the lingering tensions and sensitivities surrounding sign-stealing in Major League Baseball.</p>

The victims were identified as Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The investigation began after the victims' infant was found abandoned in a car seat in a stranger's yard, leading authorities to discover the bodies and launch the search for the armed and dangerous suspect.</p>

          <p>Following several recent emergency aircraft evacuations, including one where passengers were seen grabbing luggage, Senator Tammy Duckworth is pressing the FAA for answers on its safety standards. In a letter to the new FAA administrator, Duckworth questioned the realism of the 90-second evacuation rule, citing a recent incident that reportedly took 10-15 minutes. She is demanding data on how long recent evacuations took and an update on congressionally mandated testing that was supposed to reflect real-world conditions with luggage and a diverse mix of passengers. The senator argues that current standards may be outdated and not ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>This article explores the mechanics of reverse mortgages, a financial tool for older homeowners to convert home equity into cash. It clarifies that a borrower cannot "outlive" the loan itself, as it does not expire or come due as long as they live in the home and meet obligations like paying taxes and insurance. However, it is possible to outlive the home's equity, as the loan balance grows with interest and withdrawals, potentially leaving no value for heirs. The article advises that payment structures like monthly tenure payments or a line of credit are more sustainable for those concerned about longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, OpenAI has released two open-weight AI models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, designed to be lower-cost alternatives for developers and researchers. Unlike closed models, open-weight models have publicly available parameters, allowing for greater customization and transparency. The move positions OpenAI to compete with other tech companies like Meta and Mistral that have already embraced a more open approach. After delaying the launch for additional safety testing, OpenAI stated the models were trained to filter out harmful data and are being released under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.</p>

          <p>The acting head of NASA has directed the agency to accelerate its program to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon, setting a target launch date for late 2029. The directive emphasizes the need for the U.S. to establish a lunar power source before China and Russia, who are planning a joint reactor by the mid-2030s. The plan, called Fission Surface Power, aims to develop a 100-kilowatt microreactor to support the Artemis lunar exploration program. This ambitious goal comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and as no microreactor has yet been licensed or built in the United States.</p>

          <p>Total credit card debt in the United States rose to $1.21 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, matching the all-time high set a year prior, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The report also highlighted that delinquency rates for credit cards remain elevated, with nearly 7% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year. Researchers suggest this is partly due to consumers overextending themselves as inflation raised living costs in recent years. The data points to ongoing financial strain for many households, particularly subprime borrowers who are showing increasing signs of stress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is formally ending the "five things" program, an initiative launched by former adviser Elon Musk that required federal employees to email a weekly summary of their five main achievements. The unpopular mandate, implemented by the Office of Personnel Management to increase accountability, had already been phased out by many agencies. This official termination signals a move away from one of Musk's key policies following a public falling out between him and President Trump. The program had been criticized for being inefficient and causing confusion among the federal workforce since its inception.</p>

          <p>Shares of the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase fell on Tuesday, continuing a sharp decline that has seen the stock drop more than 30% from its record high in mid-July. The slide occurred as the company announced a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes and as the broader market adopted a more risk-averse stance. Coinbase's stock had surged earlier in the summer, fueled by legislative momentum for crypto regulation and its inclusion in the S&P 500. Despite long-term optimism from some analysts, the recent downturn suggests waning momentum after a period of rapid growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance after reporting second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to rise. The company's strong performance was driven by better-than-expected revenue from its Covid products and other key drugs. The raised outlook also reflects confidence in the company's cost-cutting measures and strategic priorities. Pfizer's guidance accounts for existing tariffs and potential drug price changes stemming from ongoing discussions with the Trump administration, which has been pressuring the industry to lower costs for U.S. consumers.

          <p>A British couple from East Sussex, detained in Iran since January on espionage charges, have been permitted to make their first phone calls home after more than 200 days without direct contact.

Their son described the brief, emotional calls as a "massive relief" but stressed that the focus must remain on securing their release.

          <p>High-profile Democrats, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin, have joined Texas Democratic lawmakers in their fight against a Republican-led redistricting plan. The plan aims to create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts, which Democrats argue is an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters and violate the Voting Rights Act. Texas Democrats have denied Republicans a quorum by leaving the state, prompting the Texas House Speaker to issue civil arrest warrants. The standoff highlights a major national battle over voting rights and political power ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced plans to restore and reinstall a statue of Confederate general Albert Pike that was toppled by protesters in Washington D.C. during the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations. The agency cited federal historic preservation law and recent executive orders from President Trump as the basis for its decision. The move has been condemned by D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, who called the decision "morally objectionable" and pledged to reintroduce a bill for the statue's permanent removal. The statue has long been controversial due to Pike's Confederate service and alleged ties to the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
