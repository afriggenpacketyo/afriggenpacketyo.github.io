          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers were dismissed for gross misconduct after performing a humiliating strip-search on a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, in 2020. The student was wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis and was searched at her school without an appropriate adult present. While a disciplinary panel did not find race to be a direct factor, the incident, which occurred while the girl was on her period, prompted widespread public outrage and has forced the police force to acknowledge significant organizational failings and implement policy changes.</p>

During an energy summit in Rio de Janeiro, representatives from SPIC and CEEC emphasized the need for long-term predictability, particularly for energy storage projects. China has become a primary investor in Brazil's energy sector, with a significant focus on clean technologies, but executives cautioned that continued delays and regulatory uncertainty could cause capital and technology to be redirected elsewhere.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Medicaid patients and providers like Planned Parenthood cannot sue states under a federal civil rights law to enforce the 'free choice of provider' provision. The case, *Medina v. Planned Parenthood*, centered on South Carolina's effort to exclude the organization from its Medicaid program. Justice Neil Gorsuch's majority opinion effectively renders much of federal Medicaid law unenforceable through private lawsuits, a move that dissenting justices warned could have sweeping, harmful implications for low-income Americans' access to healthcare across the country.</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt, debt settlement offers a potential solution by negotiating with creditors to pay less than the total amount owed. While this can provide substantial financial relief and may be a better alternative to bankruptcy, it also carries significant drawbacks. The process severely damages credit scores for up to seven years, offers no guarantee of success, and any forgiven debt may be considered taxable income. Experts advise carefully weighing these consequences and exploring all other options before pursuing this path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Florida, the lightning capital of the U.S., a specialized lab run by Florida Power and Light is creating its own powerful electrical bolts to test and strengthen energy infrastructure. Scientists and engineers subject equipment like power insulators to hundreds of thousands of volts to understand their breaking points and develop more resilient technology. This research is increasingly critical as climate change may alter weather patterns, and it aims to protect both the power grid and the public from the destructive force of lightning, which causes thousands of injuries and fatalities.</p>

The legislation aims to save £5 billion annually by tightening eligibility for disability benefits, but it has faced criticism for its potential impact on vulnerable people.

          <h2>Daughter of Murder Victims Links Misogyny on Social Media to Real-World Violence</h2>

          <p>In her first interview, Amy Hunt, whose mother and two sisters were murdered last year, described misogyny as a societal "epidemic" fueled by social media that leads to devastating consequences. The man who killed her family members had reportedly watched content from misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate before the attacks. Hunt argues that while the killer was already dangerous, society emboldens such hatred, and she calls on platforms, schools, and individuals to address the clear link between online hate and real-world violence against women.</p>

          <h2>Trump Assumes Unprecedented Veto Power Over U.S. Steel Through 'Golden Share'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 12:20:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump now personally holds a "golden share" in U.S. Steel, granting him direct veto power over key corporate decisions following the company's merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. According to corporate filings, this unprecedented arrangement gives Trump control over decisions like closing production facilities, moving headquarters, or cutting employee salaries. This power will transfer to the Treasury and Commerce Departments after he leaves office. The move, part of a national security agreement, gives the executive branch a startling degree of personal power over a major corporation. (not investment advice)</p>
