          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas after Democratic state lawmakers fled to prevent a vote on a new Republican-drawn congressional map. Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return, citing potential forfeiture of their positions. The lawmakers, who are holding events in other states, argue the proposed map is a partisan effort to unfairly secure Republican control of the U.S. House in future elections. This maneuver denies the legislature the quorum needed to conduct business, halting the bill's progress for now.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma experienced a significant 23% drop on Monday, erasing a substantial portion of the gains from its successful market debut the previous week. After its initial public offering price of $33 per share, the stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading. This recent decline reflects market volatility for the newly public company, which, unlike many tech startups, has a history of profitability. The company's valuation remains considerably higher than the price Adobe had offered in a blocked 2022 acquisition attempt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of Ireland, Spain, and Norway have officially recognized the state of Palestine. The decision, which has been under consideration in Ireland for decades, was formalized as a response to the ongoing conflict and a push for a two-state solution. Irish leaders expressed hope that other European nations like Malta and Slovenia will soon follow suit, arguing that recognition can no longer wait for a final peace settlement. Israel has strongly condemned the action, withdrawing its ambassador from Dublin in protest.</p>

          <p>Mixed martial arts star Conor McGregor is actively pursuing his previously announced intention to run for president of Ireland by launching a public petition. The petition seeks to amend the country's nomination process, which currently requires support from either 20 members of parliament or four county councils. McGregor argues this system restricts the direct will of the electorate and is advocating for a more inclusive process to get his name on the ballot. His political ambitions have been linked to his opposition to the EU Migration Pact and recent meetings with former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a nominee for an open seat on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors this week, following the departure of Adriana Kugler. This appointment is viewed as a potential tryout for the next Fed Chair, as President Trump continues to pressure the central bank to implement significant interest rate cuts. Economic advisor Kevin Hassett is considered a candidate, having recently advocated for immediate rate cuts. The decision comes as other Fed governors have also signaled a desire for lower rates, intensifying the political focus on the institution's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

His demand follows the case of two men charged in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire, who are reported to be Afghan nationals. Farage argues that withholding such information fuels online speculation and conspiracy theories, drawing parallels to the public unrest after the Southport attacks. Police officials have stated they follow national guidelines, which do not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after charges are filed.</p>

          <p>The recent firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by President Trump has drawn sharp criticism from former agency heads and economic groups. Trump alleged, without evidence, that McEntarfer manipulated July's jobs report to harm his administration. A bipartisan group of former BLS commissioners, including one appointed by Trump, called the firing meritless and a dangerous precedent that undermines the credibility of essential economic data. They have urged Congress to investigate the removal and ensure the nonpartisan integrity of the position is protected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key regulation known as the 60% rule significantly impacts homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This federal guideline limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds within the first year. The rule was designed to prevent seniors from depleting their home equity too quickly, promoting long-term financial stability. However, for those needing a large lump sum immediately for expenses like debt or home renovations, this restriction can present a challenge, delaying access to the full amount of their available funds.

          <p>Ari Buchman, a 10-year-old girl who was on a summer camp sailboat that crashed with a barge near Miami Beach last Monday, has died, her family, synagogue and officials confirmed Sunday. She's the third child killed in the incident.\n\nMila Yankelevich, 7, the granddaughter of prominent Argentine media producers Cris Morena and Gustavo Yankelevich, drowned soon after impact, investigators said. Thirteen-year-old Erin Ko Han also died by accidental drowning, authorities said.\n\nThe fourth girl, an 8-year-old, was released from a local hospital on Thursday.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard, family and Temple Menorah confirm Buchman's passing\n\n"On the saddest day of the Jewish calendar," former Bal Harbour Mayor Gabe Groisman wrote on X, referring to Tisha B'Av, a Jewish day of commemoration that marks the destruction of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, which was observed this year on Sunday, "my family mourns the loss of our 10 year-old cousin Arielle, who passed away as a result of a tragic sailboat accident that occurred early in the week."\n\nBuchman's family's place of worship, Temple Menorah in Miami Beach, made the announcement on the girl's passing Sunday morning: "With broken hearts, we announce the funeral service of our beloved Arielle Mazi Buchman." That service was set to take place Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard also confirmed her death, though they did not identify Buchman by name.\n\n"It is with the heavy heart that Coast Guard investigators announce the passing of the 10-year-old child that was in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. The child passed while surrounded by her immediate family," Capt. Frank Florio, commanding officer of Coast Guard Sector Miami, said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, the Miami Yacht Club also released a statement on Buchman's passing.\n\n"The Miami Yacht Club (MYC) and the Miami Youth Sailing Foundation (YSF) are deeply heartbroken to share that a third young sailor has tragically passed away as a result of the incident that occurred on the water earlier this week," said Lisa Mozloom, spokesperson for the MYC.\n\n"This devastating news comes after two young sailors lost their lives in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy. Now, with the passing of a third sailor, the entire sailing community is shattered by grief," she added.\n\nThe day of the deadly sailboat crash near Miami Beach\n\nThe crash occurred around 11:15 a.m. Monday between Hibiscus Island and Monument Island, authorities said. Six people, five girls and one adult camp counselor, were aboard the sailboat when it was struck. The sailboat was dragged under the barge which had a crane on top and what appeared to be pilings for a dock.\n\nMiami Beach Fire Rescue crews were first on scene, they were later joined by rescue crews from Miami, Miami-Dade, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Coast Guard. Working together they recovered all six people.\n\nA 12-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman were treated after being taken to the Miami Yacht Club and did not require hospitalization.\n\nWitnesses: "All the kids went flying off"\n\nThe children were part of a summer sailing camp operated by the Miami Yacht Club and affiliated with the Miami Youth Sailing Foundation. This was the final week of camp.\n\nCBS News Miami spoke with several of them who witnessed the crash. They said everyone on the sailboat was wearing life jackets.\n\nEnzo Pifer Eddy, 9, described the barge hitting the boat.\n\n"There was a massive boat and it hit one of the small sailboats. All of the kids went flying off. Two were found quickly and three had to go to the hospital," he said.\n\nAnother 8-year-old, who asked not to be identified, saw the crash while sailing nearby on what she called a "Wave Sailboat."\n\n"The crane just completely destroyed the boat. The boat just went under. I heard one girl yell, 'Help,' from under the crane and two girls jumped off the wave and the crane barely missed them," she said.\n\n"It was super sad and super scary. I'm just glad I wasn't on the boat, but I felt so sorry for them," she added.\n\nThe Miami Yacht Club is known for its friendly, unpretentious spirit. Membership is open to the public and they put an emphasis on introducing inner-city kids to the bay. In a statement, the club said, "The entire MYC family is devastated by this terrible tragedy."\n\nQuestions surrounding the crash\n\nOne of the questions that needs to be answered is whether the crash could have been avoided.\n\nJon Nitkin, a harbor pilot for PortMiami, said the accident happened in unrestricted waters, meaning it was wide enough that the barge had multiple avenues to maneuver around the smaller vessel.\n\n"I saw the barge. It was one of those crane barges that do work, they build seawalls and docks. Very underpowered. The move very slowly and its difficult to stop them," he said.\n\nNitkin questioned whether the captain of the tugboat, which was pushing the barge, was aware of the smaller vessel.\n\n"I don't know what kind of visibility he (tugboat captain) has from the wheelhouse. My guess, usually very poor. So they usually have a crew member up on the bow of the barge, not the tug, so he can keep a lookout," he said.\n\nCoast Guard leads crash investigation\n\nThe Coast Guard is leading the investigation into the crash.\n\n"Our hearts continue to mourn with all those impacted by Monday's tragic incident, especially with the passing of another one of Miami's children today," said Capt. Florio. "The Coast Guard remains committed to conducting a thorough investigation to ensure all facts are uncovered. We routinely seek the expertise of our federal, state, and local partner law enforcement agencies, and this case is no different. Our investigative team will be joined by investigators from Argentina, the home nation of one of the victims."\n\nThe Coast Guard has also extended an invitation to the Chilean National Maritime Authority (DIRECTEMAR) to also participate in the marine investigation.\n\ncontributed to this report.</p>
