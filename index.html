          <p>The Six Triple Eight, an all-Black, all-female World War II unit, received the Congressional Gold Medal for their crucial work in sorting mail for soldiers on the frontlines, significantly boosting morale. This unit faced racial prejudice while serving their country, and their efforts to sort through a massive backlog of mail in just three months exceeded expectations. The honor recognizes their dedication and service despite the challenges they faced. The story of the Six Triple Eight has gained wider recognition through a recent movie directed by Tyler Perry, ensuring their legacy is remembered. The Congressional Gold Medal has reinforced the principle that those who dedicate themselves fully, regardless of race or gender can be recognized at the highest levels.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a series of radical policy shifts and international disruptions, including mass deportations, sweeping tariffs, and pardons for January 6th participants.

Domestically, he has attacked the rule of law by defying court orders and threatening judges, while also targeting federal workers and dismantling government agencies.

          <p>Following Canada's general election, Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to meet to discuss economic and security relations.

Carney has stated that Canada deserves respect from the U.S. and will only agree to a partnership on its own terms, rejecting any notion of becoming the 51st state.

Meanwhile, the Teamsters union has vowed to fight any attempts to cut good-paying union jobs, and Amazon says it offered to increase UPS' volumes before the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a major rethinking of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is unrealistic. Blair's report suggests voters feel they are making financial sacrifices with minimal impact on global emissions. The report advocates for rapid deployment of carbon capture technology, greater use of AI for efficient energy grids, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. While Downing Street rejected Blair's suggestions, the report has sparked debate among political figures and environmental groups.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has completed his first 100 days of his nonconsecutive second term, marked by significant policy changes and visual moments. He has leaned heavily on executive orders, implementing a tariff regime and pursuing a mass deportation policy. With the help of Elon Musk, he has also initiated a plan to downsize the federal government. These actions have generated both support and controversy, shaping the visual narrative of his administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings have hit new lows, prompting a furious response and claims of "FAKE POLLS FROM FAKE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS." Polls indicate that more than half of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job, and a significant percentage believe he is a dangerous dictator. These numbers extend to specific issues like immigration and the economy, with consumer confidence also declining. Despite Trump's attempts to discredit the polls, the consistent negative trend suggests a growing dissatisfaction with his presidency.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured enough seats to form a government in Canada, although falling short of a majority, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre lost his own seat. Increased support for the two largest parties came at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP. Opinion polls at the start of the year had the Conservatives over 20 percentage points ahead of the Liberals, but after the resignation of former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the arrival of new PM Mark Carney and the tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, that lead evaporated.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Reverses Course on Displaying Tariff Surcharges After White House Pressure</h2>

          <p>Amazon has stated that displaying tariff surcharge pricing on products was "never approved" and "not going to happen" after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the idea. Some Amazon sellers have raised prices as a hedge against import costs stemming from Trump's tariffs. This reversal comes as tech billionaires try to maintain favor with the Trump administration. Amazon's earnings will be closely watched for how tariffs are affecting its businesses.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, seemingly powered by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. Carney declared that America wants Canada's land, resources, and water and that President Trump is trying to break them so that America can own them. Carney and Trump agreed to meet in person in the near future.</p>
