          <p>India's foreign ministry has defended its increased importation of Russian oil, stating the policy began only after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe following the 2022 conflict in Ukraine. The ministry responded to threats of steeper tariffs from former President Donald Trump by highlighting that the U.S. and EU also maintain significant trade with Russia. New Delhi asserted that its oil purchases were a matter of national necessity, unlike the trade conducted by Western nations, and noted that the U.S. had previously encouraged these imports to ensure global energy market stability. Bilateral trade between India and Russia has surged to a record $68.7 billion.</p>

          <p>Recovery operations are in progress across Scotland after Storm Floris caused widespread power outages and travel disruption, with gusts reaching up to 90mph. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks reported that approximately 50,000 homes lost power, calling it the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Network Rail is working to clear 119 reported incidents on train lines, primarily involving fallen trees, while authorities urge the public to check travel plans before departing. The storm also led to the cancellation of major events, including the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and some Edinburgh Fringe Festival shows.</p>

          <p>Over 40 protesters were arrested in New York City during a demonstration organized by the Jewish-American anti-occupation group IfNotNow. Hundreds had gathered to demand an end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to pressure the Trump administration to ensure more aid enters the territory amid reports of starvation. Speakers, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, condemned the Israeli government's blockade as a policy of forced mass starvation. After marching to the Trump International hotel, protesters blocked the street, leading to arrests by the New York Police Department for civil disobedience.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire, named the Gifford fire, is burning through Los Padres National Forest in central California, having scorched over 72,000 acres and threatening more than 450 structures. Evacuation orders have been issued in coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, with at least three injuries reported. Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the blaze, which was only 5% contained as of Monday evening, facing extremely challenging terrain and difficult conditions. Forecasts of hotter, drier weather and strong evening winds are expected to facilitate further rapid fire growth throughout the week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deportations under President Trump's asylum ban after a federal appeals court ruling limited the policy. The court found that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This decision effectively lifts a sweeping measure that had closed the asylum system to those entering illegally. Consequently, officials will resume processing migrants under standard immigration law, which allows them to apply for humanitarian refuge, though most will likely remain detained during the process.</p>

The proceedings could potentially target former officials like ex-CIA Director John Brennan and ex-FBI Director James Comey. The action is rooted in long-standing claims by Trump that the 'Russiagate' probe was a politically motivated conspiracy designed to undermine his presidency.</p>

          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers who became stranded on a remote beach at Point Reyes National Seashore after rising tides cut off their exit. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office reported that the pair called for help after realizing they were trapped near Elephant Rock. Due to the lack of safe access by land or sea, responders used a 100-foot line to hoist the hikers from the shore. The National Park Service warns that the area is hazardous due to powerful surf, strong currents, and unstable cliffs, advising visitors to check tide charts.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. By fleeing to states like Illinois and New York, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. In response, the Republican-controlled House voted to issue civil arrest warrants to compel their return. This escalates a political standoff over maps that former President Trump has advocated for ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, though Texas law enforcement lacks jurisdiction outside the state.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are advising Californians that tarantula sightings will be more common from August through December as it is the spiders' mating season. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, sometimes traveling up to 20 miles. The most common species in Southern California are the Mojave blonde and California ebony tarantulas, often spotted at dusk in chaparral, deserts, and mountain areas. Officials say the spiders are generally harmless unless provoked and advise the public to observe them from a distance, as they play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Communities across the United States are facing a critical shortage of volunteer firefighters, a workforce that comprises nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews. Between 1985 and 2020, the number of volunteers dropped by over 20%, while the volume of emergency calls more than tripled, leading to burnout and resource strain. This decline threatens public safety in smaller communities and could force them to transition to paid fire departments, which would significantly increase taxpayer costs.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest as he stands trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The decision, made by Judge Alexandre de Moraes, was prompted by Bolsonaro's failure to comply with previous restraining orders, including a ban on contacting allies. The judge cited an incident where Bolsonaro addressed supporters via a phone call at a rally, which was seen as a deliberate violation. The U.S. State Department has condemned the court order, while former President Trump has called the trial a 'witch-hunt' and used it to justify tariffs on Brazilian goods.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in People Aged 45-49, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for that age group. Two studies published in JAMA found that screening rates for people aged 45-49 rose 62% from 2019 to 2023. This uptick in screening is linked to a 12% annual jump in the detection of colorectal cancer from 2019 to 2022, primarily in its earlier, more treatable stages. While the findings are promising, researchers note that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable.</p>

          <p>A group of more than a dozen progressive Democratic members of Congress is urging the Trump administration to officially recognize a Palestinian state. Led by Rep. Ro Khanna of California, the lawmakers are circulating a letter addressed to the president and secretary of state, arguing that the current crisis highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination. The letter comes as several key U.S. allies have recently pledged to recognize Palestinian statehood. The Trump administration, however, has stated its opposition, viewing such a move as a reward for Hamas.</p>

          <p>Maui firefighters have been battling a brush fire located above Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of the area devastated by the 2023 Lahaina wildfires. The fire, which started near the old Sugar Cane Train warehouse, prompted the closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway due to smoke and firefighting efforts. The Maui County Fire Department reported on Monday that the blaze was slowly being contained. The incident caused concern in a community still recovering from the catastrophic fires nearly two years ago, which were among the deadliest in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was primarily driven by the impressive earnings reports from major technology companies. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over new tariffs, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw significant gains. Cramer argued that the market's resilience is rooted in the success of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, whose strong performance in cloud computing, search, and retail has bolstered investor confidence. These cash-rich companies with multiple revenue streams are seen as a stabilizing force in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

The new rules, which came into effect on August 5, now require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one. Additionally, police must conduct more thorough background checks, including speaking with partners and household members to identify signs of domestic abuse or other risk factors. The changes aim to ensure that only those who meet the highest standards of safety can possess firearms.</p>
