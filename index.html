          <p>Residents in Los Angeles' Porter Ranch and Granada Hills are being urged to stop using tap water, even if service is restored, due to a major water main break. A broken valve disrupted service to thousands of homes during a heatwave, and officials are struggling to repressurize the system as residents continue to consume water. The conservation plea is critical to allow crews to repair the damaged infrastructure, a complex process that has already faced setbacks, including the blowout of a temporary pipe used for the repairs.</p>

          <p>Northern China is experiencing its traditional rainy season with severe consequences, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. This year's flooding in Beijing is considered unusual because the storms primarily impacted the northern parts of the capital. This pattern contrasts with previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events raises concerns about changing climate patterns and their deadly impact in the region.</p>

His registration for La Liga was initially uncertain due to the club's financial issues and a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Furthermore, the reconstruction of the Camp Nou stadium is severely delayed, forcing his debut to be held at a small training ground stadium. Despite the surrounding chaos, Rashford has made a promising start on the pitch during the pre-season tour, impressing his new team.</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses alarm over the escalating global nuclear arms race, highlighted by Russia's formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The author notes that both Russia and NATO are increasing their nuclear capabilities in Europe, shifting the perception of these weapons from deterrents to offensive, war-winning tools. The piece laments the lack of widespread public protest compared to the anti-nuclear movements of the Cold War, questioning why there is an eerie silence as the world moves closer to potential catastrophe.</p>
