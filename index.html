          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 22:39:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft in response to President Trump's threats to cancel government contracts. This was sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill, leading to a public exchange of insults. However, Musk later retracted the decommissioning plan after receiving advice from an X user, showcasing the volatility of the situation. The Dragon spacecraft is critical as the only U.S. option for transporting crew to and from the International Space Station, and NASA affirmed it would continue working with industry partners to meet space objectives. The situation highlights the complex relationship between government contracts and private space exploration efforts, and it is unclear whether Trump will retaliate against Musk. Optimism surrounding the continuity of the SpaceX program remains, even with the controversy. </p>

          <p>The public dispute between Elon Musk and President Trump escalated with Musk accusing Trump of being connected to Jeffrey Epstein. This accusation came after Trump criticized Musk and threatened to cut off government subsidies to his companies. Musk also criticized Trump's domestic megabill, citing concerns about its impact on the national debt. Trump responded by saying Musk was "wearing thin" and that he had removed electric vehicle mandates, leading Musk to go "CRAZY!" Multiple administration officials have attempted to contact Musk without success, as the feud continues to unfold publicly.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed an amended complaint against the Trump administration's ban on foreign students, arguing that it is unconstitutional and a "government vendetta." The lawsuit claims the ban targets Harvard-bound students specifically, violating the First Amendment. This action follows previous disputes, including the administration freezing research funding and revoking Harvard's ability to sponsor international students. The university asserts that it has provided all required information and that the ban is retaliatory for Harvard's refusal to comply with demands for ideological screening and oversight of internal policies. The legal battle continues to create uncertainty for international students.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies, potentially costing Tesla and SpaceX billions of dollars. SpaceX benefits significantly from NASA contracts, including those for lunar missions, while Tesla relies on regulatory credits and electric vehicle tax incentives. Musk responded initially by threatening to decommission SpaceX's manned spacecraft program but later retracted the statement. The potential loss of subsidies could impact Tesla's revenue and the demand for electric vehicles, highlighting the financial stakes in the escalating feud. The outcome of this conflict could have substantial implications for both companies and the broader space and electric vehicle industries. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order, stating the policy risks causing "immediate and irreparable injury."

The judge's order prevents the government from enforcing the proclamation, which Trump justified by claiming Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students.

          <p>Retailers and food brands are increasingly offering products with fewer ingredients, driven by growing consumer concern about ultra-processed foods. This trend is exemplified by M&S's "Only" range and THIS's "Super Superfoods" range. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on ingredient count can lead to the omission of fortified nutrients, potentially harming public health. Experts suggest that simplifying formulas and utilizing new processing technologies can help create less processed products without compromising nutritional value.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In many states, time spent in juvenile detention does not count toward any subsequent incarceration, extending the duration of confinement. This practice is justified by the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. However, policy experts argue that it leads to disparities and allows kids to languish in detention without access to proper services or education.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for "illegitimate" targeting of Israel and the US. The sanctions block the judges' property and interests in the US. The ICC responded, deploring the sanctions as an attempt to undermine its independence. The measures follow the ICC's issuing of arrest warrants for top Israeli officials and its investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
