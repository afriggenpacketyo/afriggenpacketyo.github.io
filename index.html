        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and EU have reached an agreement addressing various post-Brexit issues, including professional qualification recognition, passport control procedures, pet travel, agricultural regulations, and musician touring. While the deal establishes dedicated dialogues for recognizing professional qualifications, a full agreement could take time. UK citizens will eventually be able to use EU e-gates, but not in time for this summer. The agreement also aims to simplify pet travel and removes veterinary checks for British farmers, who must align with EU food standards. British musicians will continue to face red tape when touring Europe, though efforts to support cultural exchange are ongoing. The agreement is expected to affect the UK's ability to boost trade around the world.</p>

          <p>An inquest concluded that the death of an 11-year-old girl at Liquid Leisure water park in Berkshire was an unlawful killing due to gross breaches in health and safety. Kyra Hill drowned in a designated swimming area in August 2022, and her body was recovered more than an hour after emergency services were alerted. Breaches included a lack of an emergency plan or risk assessment, with warning signs failing to adequately convey the depth of the water. The coroner noted that if parents were aware of the risks, Kyra's death would have been unlikely.</p>

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the decision to allow the project to move forward came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials.

The state's legislative Black Caucus expressed disappointment, arguing the veto blocked progress towards repairing the harm of enslavement.

The book suggests that many Democrats were aware of Biden's struggles but remained silent due to partisanship, political calculation, and a belief in the Biden mythology. Instances of Biden's decline, such as memory lapses and confusion, are detailed, with the book highlighting how his team masked his condition by simplifying speeches and relying on teleprompters. The book raises questions about the party's decision to prioritize defeating Trump over addressing concerns about Biden's fitness for office.</p>

Currently, the gold-silver ratio is high, suggesting silver may be undervalued.

          <p>Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer does not intend to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot's decision comes as a sluggish housing market causes sales to stagnate, with the company seeing an opportunity to gain market share by maintaining stable prices.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued a rare joint statement criticizing Israel's renewed military offensive in Gaza and its restrictions on humanitarian aid. The three nations, traditionally strong supporters of Israel, deemed the escalation 'wholly disproportionate' and warned of further action if Israel does not cease the offensive and lift aid restrictions. Prime Minister Netanyahu denounced the criticism, while European officials expressed increasing frustration with Israeli actions. The statement marks a significant shift in tone from major Western allies amid growing international concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

The timeline for British travelers to use EU e-gates remains uncertain, as it depends on individual EU countries' decisions.
