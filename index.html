          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese goods, experts predict that Temu and Shein will continue to be major players in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies are shifting to localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and using local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on these platforms have increased, analysts believe that Temu and Shein's ability to offer products at significantly lower prices than competitors like Amazon will allow them to remain competitive. Furthermore, their agile supply chains and small-batch production methods enable them to quickly adapt to consumer trends.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced an increase after the company reported a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year.

CEO Daniel Grieder acknowledged the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and global trade tensions on consumer sentiment, particularly in China. The company is closely monitoring these developments, including ongoing tariff discussions, but remains confident in achieving its full-year sales targets.</p>

The dismissals, which include high-ranking officers from the Rocket Force, raise concerns about the competence and reliability of China's military commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil suggests that Xi may not fully trust his advisors, potentially weakening his appetite for war.

          <p>Darnall Dental Clinic in Sheffield, UK, is struggling to maintain its NHS services for 4,000 patients due to a loss of funding, despite recent expansion. The clinic, which serves a high-needs area, has taken on additional patients but can no longer provide the same level of care, leading to patient frustration and verbal abuse towards staff. Manager Sarah Fletcher and dental nurse Olivia Tanner spoke about the difficulties in managing patient expectations and the abuse they face daily. MP Clive Betts has criticized the funding cut, calling it outrageous that a practice stepping up to offer NHS appointments is now facing financial strain.</p>

Harvard has vowed to fight what it describes as an "illegal government overreach," arguing that the administration is imposing unprecedented control over the university.</p>

His trajectory is outpacing both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo at the same age, with more goals and assists.

The lawsuit, initiated by Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri, seeks to roll back FDA access to mifepristone, including telehealth prescriptions and in-office visit requirements.

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz have largely dismissed President Trump's recent proposal to reopen the former prison, deeming it "insane" and "a bit of a stunt". Visitors cited the high cost of operating the island prison, its history as a site of Indigenous resistance, and the potential for historical erasure as reasons against the plan. Some also expressed concern that Trump's enthusiasm for mass incarceration was a driving force behind the proposal. While a few supported the idea, the majority of tourists and staff appeared incredulous and dismissive of the plan.</p>

The potential tariffs threaten to disrupt Bangladesh's growth and stability, particularly after a period of economic collapse and political upheaval.
