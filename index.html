          <p>Florida's Education Commissioner announced an investigation into state educators who posted celebratory or positive comments on social media following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The memo sent to superintendents described the behavior as "vile" and "sanctionable," reminding teachers they are held to a higher ethical standard as public servants. Governor Ron DeSantis supported the move, stating that celebrating the murder is unacceptable, as the state plans to review potential violations of educator conduct rules.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing company systematically discriminates against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims Uber drivers frequently deny service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for shedding, and refuse to accommodate mobility devices. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination, requires drivers to comply with accessibility policies, and deactivates those who violate them, stating it disagrees with the lawsuit's allegations.</p>

          <p>This article examines the significant and lasting impact of the late Charlie Kirk, who redefined conservative engagement with Gen Z. Through his organization Turning Point USA, Kirk cultivated a culturally relevant and confrontational brand of conservatism that resonated with young people, particularly those feeling alienated from mainstream institutions. His mastery of social media and debate-style events created a new ecosystem for right-leaning youth, fundamentally changing how a generation interacts with and perceives political discourse.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a ruling that prevents the president from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration wants a decision before next week's crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting, where interest rates will be decided. President Trump moved to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of misrepresentation on mortgage documents, but a lower court found the president had not provided a legally permissible cause for her removal.

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk, is depicted as a scholarship student from a middle-class, Republican-voting family in Utah. Photos show a seemingly typical suburban upbringing, including an interest in firearms and hunting trips with his family. However, a family member told investigators that Robinson had become more political recently and had expressed a strong dislike for Kirk, calling him a spreader of hate, revealing a sharp contrast to his public-facing persona.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contrasts the legal accountability faced by former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro with the situation surrounding Donald Trump in the United States. Bolsonaro was recently convicted for conspiracies related to his 2022 election loss and sentenced to prison, a decisive outcome for a leader who undermined democratic institutions. The author argues that Brazil's judiciary holding its former leader to account provides a stark example of "horizontal accountability" that appears to be missing in the current U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has publicly predicted the demise of Spirit Airlines, stating he believes the budget carrier will go out of business. Kirby argued that the ultra-low-cost airline model, which relies on low base fares and numerous additional fees, is fundamentally broken and unsustainable because customers "hate" it. His comments come as Spirit struggles with weak demand and high costs after recently emerging from its second bankruptcy filing in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Missouri state legislature has passed a new congressional map that heavily favors Republicans, a move supported by President Trump as part of a nationwide redistricting effort. The plan redraws districts to make the seat of longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver more conservative, potentially shifting the state's delegation from six Republicans and two Democrats to seven and one. The bill now heads to the Republican governor's desk, while Democrats have condemned the mid-decade gerrymandering as a rigged scheme.</p>

The move comes as pharmaceutical companies face pressure from the Trump administration to invest more in the U.S. and amid concerns over declining UK government support for the sector.
