          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party called the "America Party," positioning it as an alternative to the traditional two-party system in the United States. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president, has not specified who will lead the party or if it has been formally registered. This move comes after he left his role in the Trump administration over disagreements on fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million initiative to roll out "Best Start" family hubs across every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of support services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The plan, which builds on a previous rollout of 400 hubs, intends to support an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas. While the government touts it as a "lifeline," the opposition has questioned the novelty and specifics of the plan.</p>

          <p>After a lengthy trial, a Los Angeles jury found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, beauty executive Fabio Sementilli. Prosecutors argued she conspired with her lover, Robert Baker, to stage the murder as a burglary gone wrong to collect on a life insurance policy. Key evidence included cell phone data, surveillance footage, and testimony from Baker's accomplice, who claimed Monica directed the plot. Sementilli was sentenced to life in prison without parole and plans to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>A hiker in the UK's Peak District has gone viral for filming himself kicking over man-made stone stacks, arguing they harm the local environment. The walker, Stuart Cox, claims the stones are being taken from historic walls, destroying habitats for small wildlife and potentially causing path erosion. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust support his view, stating the stacks are detrimental to the area's natural and historical integrity. The video has sparked a debate, with many supporting the action while others have sent threats.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Advice for Young People on Securing a Summer Job with No Experience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Young people often struggle to find summer or part-time work due to a lack of previous job experience, creating a frustrating cycle. Career experts advise applicants to highlight skills gained from other activities, such as volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities. Recommendations include keeping CVs simple and one page long, tailoring cover letters to the specific job, and preparing thoroughly for interviews. While online applications are common, experts also suggest that speculatively dropping off a CV at local businesses can still be an effective way to show initiative.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Examining Donald Trump's Use of the "Madman Theory" in Foreign Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how President Donald Trump employs a foreign policy strategy rooted in unpredictability, often referred to as the "Madman Theory." The approach, intended to make adversaries believe he is capable of anything to extract concessions, has been evident in his dealings with allies and rivals alike. While it has yielded some results, such as increased NATO defense spending, experts question its long-term effectiveness against entrenched adversaries like Iran. The strategy risks being perceived as unreliable, potentially undermining trust in the U.S. as a negotiating partner.</p>

          <h2>UK's Lifetime ISAs Praised by Some Savers, Criticized by Others for Punitive Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle for first-time homebuyers and retirement, continues to divide opinion. While some savers praise the 25% government bonus as a significant boost, others criticize its restrictive rules, which can be punitive. A key issue is the £450,000 property price cap, which has not been updated since 2017 and disproportionately affects buyers in expensive areas. Withdrawing funds for a property above this limit, or for other reasons before age 60, incurs a penalty that results in losing part of one's own savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Participants expressed outrage and defiance over what they described as aggressive and terrifying tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
