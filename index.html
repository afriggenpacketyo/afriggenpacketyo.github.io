          <p>Volvo Cars announced a cost-cutting initiative of 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company's operating profit fell to 1.9 billion krona from 4.7 billion krona in the same period last year, with revenue also decreasing. The cost-cutting plan includes reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations, though specific details on layoffs are yet to be disclosed. Amidst broader automotive industry challenges and tariff concerns, Volvo Cars has withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, focusing on internal measures to navigate market headwinds.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Spain and Portugal, impacting millions and disrupting critical infrastructure such as airports, trains, and traffic systems. The outage, the cause of which is still under investigation, led to widespread disruptions in daily life, including halted transportation, closed businesses, and communication issues. Spain's national power company reported that nearly all power had been restored by Tuesday morning, approximately 18 hours after the initial blackout. While officials have ruled out foul play like a cyberattack, the exact cause of the "strong oscillation" in the European grid remains undetermined.</p>

          <p>Oil giant BP reported a 49% drop in first-quarter profit, amounting to $1.38 billion, due to weaker crude prices and a recent strategic reset. This figure fell short of analyst expectations, which had anticipated $1.6 billion. In response to underperformance, BP is focusing on its core oil and gas business while cutting back on renewable spending. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's strong operational performance, including high upstream operating efficiency and refinery output, and announced a dividend of 8 cents per ordinary share along with a $750 million share buyback.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have dropped some charges against Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of poisoning three relatives and seriously injuring another with a meal containing toxic mushrooms. Specifically, charges alleging attempted murder of her husband have been withdrawn, though she still faces three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder related to other family members. Patterson has consistently maintained her innocence and pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges. Her trial is set to begin in the Supreme Court of Victoria, where the prosecution will proceed on the reduced set of charges.</p>

          <p>Sophie Power's experience as an ultrarunner, particularly a viral photo of her breastfeeding during a 106-mile race in 2018, has led to significant changes for women in sports.

Power's advocacy has been instrumental in the implementation of pregnancy deferral policies by major events, including the London Marathon. Her efforts underscore the importance of inclusivity and support for women balancing motherhood and athletic pursuits.</p>

          <p>Tomoyuki Sugano, a rookie pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, delivered five scoreless innings, earning his third win in a 4-3 victory against the New York Yankees. Sugano (3-1) struck out eight batters and allowed only five hits, all singles, during his 95-pitch performance at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. He navigated a bases-loaded situation in the first inning and effectively used his fastballs and splitters throughout the game. Sugano's ERA of 3.00 is currently the best among Orioles starters, marking his first scoreless outing in six Major League Baseball games.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a victory in the Canadian election, fueled by a backlash against Donald Trump's rhetoric and policies. Trump's threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played a significant role in the election, making leadership and economic survival key issues. Carney capitalized on this by running against Trump, warning that the U.S. president aims to weaken Canada for American gain. Carney plans to initiate negotiations for a new economic and security relationship with the U.S. immediately following the election, marking a stunning debut for the political newcomer. </p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, have been released from prison after serving over four years for national security convictions. The charges stemmed from their participation in an unofficial primary poll in 2020, which was later deemed a conspiracy to commit subversion under national security legislation imposed by Beijing. Critics argue that the legislation has been used to suppress dissent and undermine Hong Kong's autonomy. The lawmakers were part of a group known as the "Hong Kong 47," most of whom faced charges related to the primary poll.</p>

This underperformance is attributed to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the ongoing tariff war and industrial transition.

          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to include milk-based drinks, milk substitutes, lattes, and milkshakes. This proposal aims to reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity by incentivizing manufacturers to lower sugar content in these beverages. The government also plans to reduce the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml. Since its introduction in 2018, the SDIL has raised £1.9 billion, with £338 million generated in the 2023-24 financial year.</p>

          <p>Europe's largest lender, HSBC, reported first-quarter results that surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its wealth business and corporate and institutional banking segment. The bank announced a share buyback of up to $3 billion, expected to be completed before its 2025 interim results. While profit before tax declined 25% year-on-year, it soared nearly 317% from the previous quarter. CEO Georges Elhedery highlighted the bank's momentum in earnings and disciplined execution of its strategy, though the bank warned of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and protectionist trade policies affecting sentiment.</p>

          <p>The model of football often associated with Pep Guardiola, which builds on the ideas of Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, is dominating modern football and shaping its future. Guardiola's development of 'juego de posicion,' or positional football, has influenced many coaches, including Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta, and Hansi Flick, who are all in the Champions League semi-finals. While some critics argue that this model can stifle spontaneity and creativity, it has proven to be a winning formula, with many top clubs adopting it. This approach is not just a style but a cultural force, influencing coaching hires, academy training, and football education worldwide.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, India has renewed its claims of Pakistani involvement. India's government called the massacre a terrorist attack and cited "cross-border linkages" to Pakistan, with a group called the Resistance Front claiming responsibility. Indian officials privately allege that the group is a proxy for Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist organization based in Pakistan, though they have provided little public evidence. Pakistan denies involvement and has called for an international investigation into the attack, while India points to Pakistan's past support for militant groups targeting India.</p>

This reform, combined with the Pension Dashboard, could transform retirement planning by providing a comprehensive view of pension wealth. Hargreaves Lansdown suggests expanding the platform to facilitate a Lifetime Pot model, where individuals choose a provider for all contributions throughout their career. In the meantime, individuals can track down their pensions using the Government's Pension Tracing Service and consider consolidating them, ensuring it's in their best interest to do so.</p>
