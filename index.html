            <p>Lord Peter Hendy, the UK Rail Minister, has admitted to using his mobile phone while driving a vintage double-decker bus in London during rush hour. The incident occurred on March 28th while he was giving a charity tour to raise money for the Railway Benefit Fund. He was reported to the police by a passenger and faces a likely sanction of six points on his license and a fine. This incident follows a similar case in 2022 where another government minister was banned from driving for using his phone behind the wheel.</p>

            <p>Iran and the US have concluded a first round of talks in Oman over Tehran's nuclear programme. Both countries described the meeting as "constructive" and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week. The talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done, after President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018.</p>

            <p>A federal immigration judge ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, is removable for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. Critics argue the decision is an attempt to deport Khalil solely for his constitutionally protected speech. Rubio alleges that Khalil engaged in antisemitic protests, but provides no evidence. The attempt to deport Khalil is meant primarily to discipline the people of the United States into silence and conformity.</p>
