          <p>International delegates are meeting in Geneva to finalize a global treaty aimed at controlling plastic pollution, a problem that has escalated dramatically in recent decades. The negotiations are stalled over key issues, including whether to cap plastic production or focus solely on recycling and waste management. While a coalition of nearly 100 countries supports production limits, oil-producing nations are resistant, highlighting the economic stakes involved for the fossil fuel industry. The article details the environmental and health impacts of plastics, which contain thousands of chemicals, many of which are hazardous.</p>

Based on the Y-20B transport plane, the prototype features a prominent rotating radar dome, suggesting significant upgrades in its detection and command functions. Despite some Western militaries moving away from this type of aircraft, Beijing's investment indicates a continued commitment to this strategic asset. The aircraft's design aims to enhance the People's Liberation Army's ability to monitor vast areas and coordinate military operations from the air.</p>

Investigators believe the attack was targeted, as Drummond had a prior relationship with the family, but have not detailed the accomplices' specific roles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is introducing a pilot program that could require some tourist and business visa applicants to post a bond of up to $15,000. This measure targets individuals from countries with high rates of visa overstays or inadequate security screening protocols. The program aims to ensure visitors comply with the terms of their visas and to mitigate financial liability for the government. The proposal is part of a broader tightening of visa requirements and would not apply to countries in the Visa Waiver Program.</p>

          <p>India has responded to threats of increased U.S. tariffs by defending its purchase of Russian oil, stating the imports were necessary after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The Indian foreign ministry noted that both the U.S. and the EU continue to trade with Russia, arguing that their criticism is hypocritical. The statement comes after former President Trump threatened to substantially raise tariffs on India, accusing it of profiting from discounted Russian crude. India maintains that its actions have helped stabilize global energy markets, a move it claims was previously encouraged by the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that the adoption of artificial intelligence was a factor in over 10,000 job losses in the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has seen the most significant cuts, with layoffs up 36% from the previous year. The report highlights AI as one of the top five reasons for job reductions, alongside federal spending cuts and economic uncertainty impacting the retail sector. The trend is also affecting entry-level corporate roles, with listings for recent graduates declining as employers increasingly seek AI-related skills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The political conflict over Texas redistricting has intensified, with fleeing Texas Democrats framing it as an "all-out war" for democracy. They have found allies in Democratic governors like California's Gavin Newsom, who has pledged to "fight fire with fire" by pursuing retaliatory redistricting if Texas Republicans proceed. The Texas Democrats, who left the state to deny Republicans a quorum, accuse the GOP's proposed map of being a "racist... scheme" designed to silence minority voters. Republicans, including Governor Greg Abbott, have condemned the move as a dereliction of duty and an abandonment of Texan constituents.</p>

The arrest warrants are intended to compel the members' return to the Capitol, though their enforcement is limited outside of Texas.

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concludes that a Chinese military blockade would rapidly deplete Taiwan's critical energy supplies. The analysis, based on 26 wargaming scenarios, found that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. The report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. This underscores the island's vulnerability and the high stakes of any potential military confrontation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including 11 prizes of £100,000, remain unclaimed in the United Kingdom. National Savings and Investments (NS&I), the government-owned bank that runs the savings scheme, is facing criticism for not doing enough to locate the winners. The issue is particularly difficult for individuals who were gifted bonds as children or only possess old paper records, making them hard to trace. While NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since 1957, critics argue the process needs reform to reunite people with their money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social in support of actress Sydney Sweeney and her recent advertising campaign for American Eagle, calling it the "HOTTEST ad out there." The ad had faced some social media criticism for its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans," which some interpreted as echoing eugenics rhetoric. Following Trump's endorsement, which also praised Sweeney as a "registered Republican," American Eagle's stock price surged by over 20%. The company has defended the campaign, stating it was always intended to be about their denim jeans and celebrating individual style. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is warning hunters and the public after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Lab tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by the consumption of a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide, either directly or through eating other poisoned animals. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target wildlife from accessing bait. They also advise hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue and to report such findings to the wildlife health lab.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people aged 45-49. Following updated guidelines, screening rates in this age group rose by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This uptick in testing corresponds with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers find the trend promising, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and are not increasing equitably across all demographics.</p>

This move comes as several key U.S. allies, including France and Canada, have recently pledged to support Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. The Trump administration, however, has stated its opposition, viewing such a move as "rewarding Hamas," creating a clear policy divergence with some members of Congress.</p>
