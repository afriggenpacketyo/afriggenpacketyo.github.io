          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, plans to distribute his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he has fathered. Durov, who is the "official father" of six children with three partners, has also donated sperm to a fertility clinic, resulting in over 100 additional children. He intends for his children to access their inheritance after 30 years, encouraging them to develop self-reliance and independence. Durov cited the risks associated with his work, particularly defending freedoms, as the reason for writing a will now, as he faces criminal charges in France which he has refuted. The charges relate to allegedly failing to properly moderate the app to reduce criminality, which he says is an absurd accusation. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding for the need to address the increasing welfare bill, but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit are not the solution. The government's bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit. Impact assessments suggest 370,000 existing claimants could lose out, saving Â£1.7 billion by 2029/30, while ministers maintain the reforms will ensure support for those who can work and protection for those with severe disabilities. As a government whip, Foxcroft felt unable to support reforms that would negatively impact disabled people's finances.</p>

          <p>The matcha industry in Japan is experiencing a boom in popularity, but faces potential challenges due to the threat of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump. Tea farmers are concerned that increased prices could dampen sales and shrink the global market for Japanese powdered tea. This uncertainty has created anxiety among experts and farmers, who fear the loss of a promising and lucrative opportunity. The Kokaen tea farm in Aichi Prefecture is among many that have benefited from the recent surge in matcha demand, but now face an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>The UNHCR reports that nearly 13 million people have been displaced in West and Central Africa due to conflict, climate shocks, and migration trends. Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon host over 80% of internally displaced persons, with drought, flooding, and violence forcing people to seek shelter within their countries. The UN is sponsoring voluntary returns, with 11,000 refugees returning to countries like Nigeria and Mali between January and April 2025. Despite these efforts, the UNHCR's regional budget has been significantly reduced, impacting the provision of essential services like food, shelter, and healthcare, and experts suggest that new strategies are needed to foster regular migration and benefit both home and destination countries.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart International Group's shares experienced a significant drop after the People's Daily newspaper criticized the company's "blind box" business model. The commentary warned against the addictive nature of these collectibles, highlighting concerns that they are "business traps" encouraging repeat purchases through unpredictable rewards. The People's Daily cited legal experts and academics who emphasized the vulnerability of minors to these tactics, calling for stronger regulations to protect them. This reflects the thinking of Chinaâ€™s policymakers, who issued a directive in 2023 banning the sale of blind boxes to children under eight years old to curb addiction.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a significant drop in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets, according to official figures. Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers reporting lower sales of alcohol and tobacco. Clothing and household goods stores also reported "slow trading," contributing to the overall downturn. Separate economic data revealed that government borrowing increased last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993.</p>

Wang stated that Beijing hopes the US can "meet China halfway" and contribute positively to the development of bilateral relations.

          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly critical of cities due to their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies, often contrasting them with more conservative areas. Cities are seen as places where the future starts, challenging the populist focus on preserving the past. The shift of many cities towards the center-left has been a bitter defeat for the right, leading to caricatures of urban governments and a disregard for their political complexity. Despite the right's animosity, cities remain crucial economic hubs, and their resistance to intolerant populism serves as an act of defiance and encouragement.</p>

Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious with potential fire hazards.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta remain committed to holding the president accountable for using the military as domestic law enforcement. The ruling allows Trump to keep control of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to quell riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

Bad Bunny's "NUEVAYoL" is predicted to be the song of the summer that inexplicably came out in January, while PinkPantheress' "Tonight" is the song for those chronically online. Lorde's "What Was That" is anticipated to be the breakup song of the summer, and KATSEYE's "Gnarly" is the song for girls and those who love them. Young Miko's "WASSUP" is the song for singles ready to mingle, and Alex Warren's "Ordinary" is the British boy ballad interpreted by an American. The biggest song of the year, and therefore the song of the summer by default, is "Luther" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential benefits and risks of military action against Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, believing it necessary to prevent weapons production. While he approved attack plans, Trump is holding off on a final decision, hoping Tehran will abandon its nuclear program. The president is reviewing options, including the use of bunker-buster bombs, and is aware of diplomatic efforts led by the UK to negotiate with Iran. Meanwhile, Iran has prepared missiles and equipment to strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.</p>
