          <p>The United Kingdom is facing continued disruption as clean-up operations begin after Storm Floris caused widespread power outages and travel chaos. Approximately 50,000 homes, primarily in the Scottish Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, lost electricity in what has been described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Gusts reached up to 90mph, leading to numerous flight and train cancellations, and forcing the closure of major road bridges. While a yellow weather warning remains in effect for parts of Scotland, authorities are working to restore services and clear debris from the transportation network.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is scheduled to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate convicted of a 1988 triple murder. The case is unique as Black has a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, raising concerns among his attorneys that the device could activate during the lethal injection, potentially causing undue pain and prolonging the execution. Despite legal challenges and claims of intellectual disability, both the governor and the U.S. Supreme Court have denied a reprieve, allowing the execution to proceed. The situation has highlighted ethical dilemmas for medical professionals and the complexities of capital punishment involving inmates with advanced medical conditions.</p>

          <p>As England looks ahead to the Ashes series in Australia, the team's prospects appear to be critically dependent on the fitness and performance of captain Ben Stokes. England has not won a Test series in Australia since 2010-11, and the current squad lacks experience in those conditions. The article posits that Stokes' all-around contributions as a player and his leadership are the key elements that give England a chance against a formidable Australian team. While England's batting lineup shows promise, concerns remain about the durability of the bowling attack and the team's overall lack of preparation.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has placed former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. The order was issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who stated Bolsonaro violated previous precautionary measures by addressing supporters via his son's phone. This development occurs as the U.S. Trump administration imposes tariffs on Brazil, linking them to Bolsonaro's legal situation and sanctioning the judge. The case has intensified political divisions in Brazil, with Bolsonaro's supporters protesting and his lawyers planning to appeal the decision.</p>

However, the game was decided by the bullpens, with the Cardinals ultimately securing the win with a go-ahead single in the ninth inning. Despite a solo home run from Freddie Freeman and a late rally attempt, the Dodgers could not overcome the Cardinals' relief pitching to secure a victory at home.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's Operation Storm, which effectively ended its war of independence, the event is remembered with deeply divided perspectives by Croatia and Serbia. In Croatia, it is celebrated as a heroic military victory that reclaimed occupied territory and is marked by patriotic events and military parades. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass expulsion and murder of approximately 200,000 ethnic Serbs from the Krajina region. This divergence highlights the lasting ethnic tensions and unresolved historical grievances that continue to shape political rhetoric and relations in the Balkans.</p>

The victory of a populist-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Donald Tusk's falling approval ratings suggest the current liberal government may be short-lived. The authors contend that post-populist governments often struggle with dismantling legal minefields left by their predecessors and fail to present a compelling future vision. They suggest Tusk's strategy of adopting some populist policies has failed, serving as a cautionary tale for democratic leaders globally.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous and medical waste in California. The suit, brought by 45 county district attorneys, followed a multi-year investigation into 140 UPS facilities. It claimed that corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials were sent to landfills not equipped to handle them. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California operations to address the issues raised in the lawsuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts in California are noting an increase in tarantula sightings as the spiders' annual mating season begins. From August through December, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, making them more visible in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. While their appearance can be alarming, experts emphasize that California's native tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their primary defense mechanism involves flicking irritant hairs from their bodies, which can cause a minor rash.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Communities across the U.S. are facing a growing public safety challenge due to a significant shortage of volunteer firefighters. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's firefighting force, saving taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually, but their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985 while emergency calls have tripled. This trend is straining existing crews and could force more towns to transition to costly paid fire departments. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment and ensure smaller communities can maintain essential emergency services.</p>

The council is being re-established as part of an executive order that also brings back the Presidential Fitness Test in schools. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, noted his respect for the office but chose to forgo this particular role.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised a controversial marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump endorsed the ad, which had drawn criticism online for its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans," with some accusing it of promoting eugenics. The president's support, which he contrasted with what he called "woke" advertising from other brands, fueled a rally in the company's stock. The retailer had recently been facing financial difficulties, including slow sales and a write-off of seasonal merchandise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has analyzed Taiwan's resilience in the event of a military blockade by mainland China. The study, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, concluded that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just three weeks, coal in seven weeks, and oil in 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. This analysis underscores the island's significant energy vulnerabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its tracing process, which can be difficult for people who were gifted bonds or only have old paper records. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of prize winners since 1957, the large unclaimed sum has drawn attention amid the ongoing cost of living crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in California are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have been exposed to a blue-dyed rodenticide, causing their fat and muscle tissue to turn blue. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) confirmed the presence of the anticoagulant diphacinone in a sample. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target species from accessing bait. They are also advising hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue and to report such findings, as rodenticide exposure may not always be visible.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45 to 49 is leading to more diagnoses at an earlier, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this demographic increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This corresponds with a significant jump in the incidence of early-stage cancer detection. While researchers find the trend promising, they note that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and that disparities exist based on education and insurance status.</p>
