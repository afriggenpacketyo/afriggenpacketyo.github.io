          <p>Gangs in Peru are increasingly preying on local businesses, demanding money and resorting to violence when refused, leading to a surge in extortions that have traumatized many parts of the country. The rise in gang activity reflects broader issues of lawlessness and economic instability, with local businesses feeling vulnerable and unprotected. The pervasive fear is stifling economic growth and disrupting daily life as residents struggle to cope with the escalating violence. This situation underscores the urgent need for effective law enforcement and community support to address the root causes of gang violence and restore stability.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that would cut significant funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially causing millions to lose health insurance. A KFF survey reveals that nearly half (45%) of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace plans identify as Republicans, with a substantial portion being "MAGA" Republicans. This situation arises as many red-leaning states did not expand Medicaid, leading more Republicans to seek coverage through ACA exchanges, especially the self-employed. If the proposed legislation passes without extending tax credits, an estimated 15 million people could lose their health insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders requiring groups to halt diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or acknowledge transgender people to receive grant funding. Judge Jon Tigar stated that pro-LGBTQ nonprofits demonstrated a likelihood of success in challenging the executive orders, arguing they violate the Constitution. The judge emphasized that the executive branch cannot weaponize Congressionally appropriated funds to single out protected communities or suppress disfavored ideas. This ruling will remain in effect during the legal case, though government lawyers are expected to appeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans, often vocal about deficit and federal spending, face a revenue problem as the U.S. collects less money as a share of GDP compared to similar countries. Tax cuts enacted under Presidents Bush and Trump have significantly contributed to the national debt, with estimates suggesting that 37 percent of the current deficit can be attributed to these tax cuts. The party's long-standing anti-tax consensus is now challenged by shifting demographics and the distributional impact of tax-cutting measures. Addressing the deficit requires not only spending cuts but also raising revenue, a concept many Republicans resist.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are warning that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful or even deadly to hummingbirds, turning a lifeline into a trap. If sugar water is left out too long, it spoils and attracts harmful microbes that can cause infections, including candida, leading to swollen tongues and starvation. The solution is to regularly clean feeders every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. By maintaining clean feeders and using the right sugar-water recipe, people can provide a valuable food source for hummingbirds.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has written to UEFA to raise concerns over Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League, citing potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on John Textor, owner of Eagle Football, which holds a 43% stake in Palace and a 77% stake in Lyon, who have also qualified for the competition. UEFA rules prevent any entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League, stands to benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible for the Europa League.</p>

These institutions are trying to resist Trump's ideological subjugation while quietly sanding down their left-wing edges, such as walking back DEI efforts and suppressing anti-Israel sentiment. Despite these efforts, it is unclear if academia's shift to the right will satisfy officials whose goal may be retribution rather than reform.

          <p>Despite a quiet offseason, the San Diego Padres are performing well in the tough National League West, currently nine games over .500 and two games out of first place. The team has integrated new players like Jackson Merrill, who replaced Juan Soto, and minor league signee Gavin Sheets. While acknowledging fan concerns about the lack of big-name acquisitions, the team remains confident in their talent and ability to make adjustments throughout the year. The Padres' success will depend on the health of their starting pitchers and their ability to acquire additional talent before the trading deadline.</p>
