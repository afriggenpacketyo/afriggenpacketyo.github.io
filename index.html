          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, highlighting his administration's efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Trump's speech emphasized changes made since his administration began, including the disbanding of student clubs like the National Society of Black Engineers. He also mentioned the removal of books related to diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries, which sparked criticism from former West Point teachers who argued against indoctrination. The president touted high recruiting numbers and plans for a military parade in Washington, D.C., while also referencing past health concerns during a 2020 West Point address.

          <p>According to the UK Home Office, a record number of Americans are seeking residency in the UK, with over 6,000 applying in the year leading up to March.

          <p>Analysts suggest that America's next-generation fighter jets and "loyal wingmen" drones could offset China's advantage in fleet size and extend operational range in the Indo-Pacific region. General David Allvin, chief of staff of the US Air Force, showcased the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle, part of the collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA). However, experts note that China is also advancing in this technology, narrowing the gap. The US Air Force has begun ground testing the initial CCA designs, with production expected in 2026.
