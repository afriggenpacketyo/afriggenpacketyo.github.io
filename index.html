          <h2>FEMA Head Reportedly Unaware of Hurricane Season, Sparks Confusion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that the acting head of FEMA, David Richardson, stated he was unaware that the U.S. has a hurricane season during a daily briefing, causing confusion among FEMA staff. While a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, current and former employees expressed concern, citing low morale within the agency due to recent leadership changes and other issues. The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1st to November, with NOAA predicting an above-average season this year, potentially bringing 13 to 19 named storms. The incident has raised questions about the leadership's preparedness for the upcoming hurricane season. Optimism is tempered by concerns about agency leadership and the potential impact on disaster response. </p>

          <p>Snowflake, a data analytics software maker, has announced its acquisition of Crunchy Data, a startup specializing in cloud-based database software, for approximately $250 million. Crunchy Data provides access to a cloud-hosted version of the PostgreSQL open-source database, which offers security and performance enhancements. This acquisition follows Databricks' recent announcement of its intent to acquire Neon, another PostgreSQL-based software company, highlighting the growing importance of PostgreSQL in the data analytics landscape. Snowflake plans to provide early access to a PostgreSQL database service, simplifying data movement into Snowflake for easier query execution on larger datasets, which will help them benefit from corporate spending to deliver artificial intelligence agents that carry out tasks on their own.

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at its fastest pace since September 2022, with a decline in new export orders. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 48.3, signaling contraction for the first time since September of the previous year. This private gauge follows the official PMI, which also indicated a contraction in manufacturing activity for the second consecutive month, although ticking slightly higher to 49.5. The private survey focuses on smaller, export-oriented firms, while the official PMI samples a broader range of companies, reflecting early signs of stabilization in the sector.

          <p>A former Taiwanese defense official, Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, has warned of increasing risks of a cross-strait military accident due to heightened pressure from Beijing on Taiwan. Yang cited the rise in "grey zone operations" by China, including more frequent activities by its coastguard forces near Taiwan, which are difficult to manage as they carry a military message without being actual military operations. He also expressed concern about the lack of official communication channels between Beijing and Taipei since 2016. Exchanges were suspended after the previous Taiwanese leader refused to accept the one-China principle, and formal talks remain halted under the current leader, further increasing the potential for miscommunication and accidental conflict.</p>

          <p>A recent court ruling against Donald Trump's global trade tariffs has prompted a response that illustrates Trump's emphasis on loyalty, as he criticized the judges and the Federalist Society for not supporting him. The article points out that Trump seems unable to comprehend a good explanation for an inconvenient court ruling other than Trump Derangement Syndrome, and that he believes anything bad for him is unfair and illegitimate. The author argues that the supreme qualification for appointments to the Trump administration has been servile loyalty to Trump, and that he expects the same from judges. The article suggests that Trump's attack on the Federalist Society signals that it, too, must bend the knee and its principles to the needs of one man.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill that encompasses much of the Republican legislative agenda. The White House is launching an "all-out advocacy effort," with administration officials engaging in direct pressure and potential state visits to sway Republican senators. Key sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential cuts to Medicaid coverage, with Trump reassuring senators that there will be no Medicaid benefit cuts. Republicans are using a reconciliation process to pass the bill with a simple majority, but changes may be necessary to comply with the Byrd rule, which requires legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction.</p>

Key provisions include increased border security, deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants, and the repeal of Biden's EV mandate.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a 72-hour stay for a Boston high school student, Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, who was detained by ICE agents while on his way to volleyball practice. Gomes, who entered the U.S. on a student visa that has since lapsed, is eligible for asylum. ICE defended the arrest, stating that Gomes was in the country illegally, while his attorney argued he has no criminal history. The state's governor expressed outrage, and hundreds protested against Gomes's detention. The judge issued the stay to allow for a review of the case.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has reversed a ruling that shielded a Los Angeles police officer from liability in a fatal shooting, potentially impacting future cases involving qualified immunity. The ruling concerns the shooting of Daniel Hernandez by LAPD officer Toni McBride, who fired the final two shots while Hernandez was on the ground. The court cited a 2017 case as precedent, stating that continuing to shoot a suspect who appears incapacitated violates the Fourth Amendment. The case will now proceed to trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.</p>
