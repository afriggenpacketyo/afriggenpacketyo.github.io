          <p>A report from insurance company Munich Re indicates that natural disasters have caused over $131 billion in global economic losses in the first half of 2025. The Los Angeles wildfires were the year's costliest event, accounting for $53 billion in damages. Scientists and insurance experts attribute the rising losses to the increasing intensity of weather events driven by climate change and growing development in high-risk areas. The report highlights that weather-related disasters, such as storms and wildfires, were responsible for 88% of the total losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal has become more personal, with legal filings alleging he directly warned owner Rupert Murdoch that a reported birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein was a fake. Trump's lawyers are now seeking an accelerated deposition from the 94-year-old Murdoch, citing his advanced age and health as reasons he may be unavailable for a future trial. This unusual legal tactic is seen by some observers as an attempt to pressure the newspaper and its parent company, News Corp. The suit highlights the complex and deteriorating relationship between the two powerful conservative figures.</p>

          <h2>DHS Signals Policy Shift, Encourages DACA Recipients to Self-Deport</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is adopting a harsher stance towards DACA recipients, with the Department of Homeland Security now openly encouraging them to self-deport. This shift comes amid efforts to strip program participants, known as Dreamers, of benefits like access to federal healthcare marketplaces and financial aid. Although the DACA program has not been formally rescinded, immigrant advocates state that increased arrests and detentions are eroding its protections. The mixed messaging from the administration has created significant fear and uncertainty for the approximately 525,000 individuals who rely on the program for temporary protection from deportation.</p>

          <p>A severe hunger crisis in Gaza is causing widespread malnutrition, with particularly devastating effects on children and pregnant women that could last for generations. Health experts report that chronic hunger stunts physical and cognitive development and can lead to long-term health issues like heart disease and diabetes. Scientific research into epigenetics suggests that the trauma of starvation can even alter gene expression, potentially passing on poor health outcomes to the descendants of survivors. The crisis has been exacerbated by disruptions in aid delivery, leading to what a UN official described as "astonishing levels of desperation."</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to tighten oversight of key manufacturing sectors, including electric vehicles and solar power. The move aims to combat excessive internal competition, a phenomenon known as 'neijuan,' and to phase out outdated production capacity through upgraded standards. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to stabilize crowded industries and promote high-tech consumer goods to stimulate domestic demand. The state's market regulator also pledged to address low-quality, cut-price competition to ensure healthier market development. (not investment advice)</p>

Gilpin defended the on-field officials, stating they followed the correct process and that the organization heavily invests in player safety.

          <p>Google is launching a new 'AI Mode' in the UK, significantly altering its search experience by providing conversational, AI-generated answers instead of a traditional list of links. While the feature is optional for now, it has sparked concern among publishers and businesses who rely on Google for web traffic. Critics fear that because AI summaries provide direct answers, users will be less likely to click through to original source websites, potentially undermining the business models of news outlets and retailers. Google argues the tool unlocks new ways for users to seek information for more complex queries.</p>

          <p>The recent EU-U.S. trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods, could unexpectedly benefit the United Kingdom, which faces a lower 10% rate. Economists suggest this tariff differential could make British exports to the U.S. more competitive, potentially boosting trade and encouraging EU-based manufacturers to shift operations to the UK to protect their profit margins. While the overall impact remains uncertain, the 5% advantage offers a potential silver lining for the British economy in a challenging global trade environment. The deal averted even higher potential tariffs, which also helps the UK by stabilizing its largest trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

This significant supply chain shift is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty.

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly placed Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko at the top of its striker wishlist for the current transfer window. However, the club's hierarchy acknowledges that any significant new signings will likely depend on their ability to offload unwanted players first to generate funds. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa has stated it is not interested in selling the 29-year-old Watkins, and Newcastle is also reportedly pursuing the 22-year-old Sesko. United feels Villa's stance on Watkins might soften closer to the transfer deadline.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese experts, China must adopt a more proactive role in shaping international discourse to counteract what they describe as a historically dominant Western narrative. They argue that Beijing should leverage its own cultural symbols and deepen engagement with scholars across Asia to build a consensus-based regional voice. This call for greater 'discourse power' comes as global dynamics shift, with emerging economies seeking a more prominent role in global governance. The experts suggest that China should take the lead in defining rules and norms in new fields to align its soft power with its economic growth.</p>

SIA began including Air India's financials in its results after a merger with Vistara, and the Indian carrier's deeper-than-expected losses have become a near-term drag on SIA's bottom line.
