          <p>Nancy Urizar is searching for answers after her 64-year-old father, Francisco Urizar, was detained by ICE agents in Pico Rivera, California. Videos circulating on social media show agents surrounding his delivery truck and taking him into custody. Nancy is seeking more information about why her father was targeted, as he fled Guatemala 35 years ago due to forced conscription and initially applied for asylum. She is frustrated by the lack of information available through the ICE Online Detainee Locator System and is concerned for his well-being while in custody. The Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to requests for information regarding Francisco's detention.</p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) currently possesses nearly five times more cash on hand compared to the Democratic National Committee (DNC), marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported having $72 million at the end of May, while the DNC held only $15 million. This financial advantage could provide the GOP with an early boost as they prepare for the upcoming midterm elections. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February (not investment advice).</p>

The move comes as Israel conducted strikes in southwestern Iran, targeting a military site containing missile launchers.

          <p>The US is moving stealth bombers to the Pacific amid tensions related to the Israel-Iran war, raising concerns about a wider regional conflict. Simultaneously, tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran. Protesters in London waved Palestinian flags and carried signs against arming Israel and waging war on Iran.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the proposed policy change, which would have capped indirect costs for universities, was arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The universities argued that the cuts would have threatened critical work in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The University of California estimated that the change would have cost it nearly $100 million a year.</p>
