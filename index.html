          <p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reports that ICE officials and a prison contractor have denied Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist in ICE custody in Louisiana, the opportunity to hold his newborn son. Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, expressed her dismay, calling the denial a deliberate act of violence that tears families apart. The ACLU stated that ICE and GEO Group cited a no-contact visitation policy and security concerns, despite federal policies encouraging contact visits between detained parents and their children. Khalil was taken into custody in early March during campus protests over the war in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Key conservatives remain opposed to President Trump's budget package, leading to overnight meetings and pressure from the president to gain support. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a challenge with a slim majority, as all Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Conservatives are pushing for stricter Medicaid work requirements and the elimination of clean energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act. Blue-state Republicans are also resisting due to concerns over the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap. Trump has urged Republicans to back the bill, emphasizing Medicaid waste reduction and compromise on the SALT issue.</p>

Ahead of the meeting, Musk-owned X faced backlash over its AI chatbot, Grok, providing unsolicited responses about attacks against white farmers, which the company attributed to an "unauthorized modification" to Grok's algorithm.</p>

          <p>Two men were sentenced to 40 years to life in prison for drugging and murdering Julio Ramirez and John Umberger after luring them from Manhattan gay bars. Jayqwan Hamilton and Robert DeMaio were convicted of murder, robbery, and conspiracy, while Jacob Barroso received 20 years to life for his role in Ramirez's death. The men systematically targeted patrons, drugging them with a fatal cocktail of drugs and draining their bank accounts. Judge Felicia A. Mennin emphasized the defendants' prioritization of luxury goods over the lives of their victims.</p>

          <p>Rapper Rod Wave was arrested in Fulton County, Georgia, on charges stemming from an incident in April, including possession of a firearm and assault. His attorneys assert his innocence, stating he was the victim of a burglary and committed no crimes. The charges reportedly stem from a dispute at his Atlanta-area home following a burglary, where a semiautomatic pistol was allegedly fired. This is not the first time that the rapper has had run-ins with the law, as he was previously arrested for battery.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson described the Republican approach to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as ranging from surgical to forceful. President Trump, a proponent of drilling, denounced the law as the "Green New Scam," influencing Republicans to consider abolishing it. Trump exerted pressure on party members during a private caucus on May 20th, threatening primary challenges to dissenters. The article highlights the tension between targeted modifications and a complete repeal of the IRA, Joe Biden's climate law.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments following mounting political pressure, with more than 10 million pensioners losing out on the payments last year. The government will change the threshold to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, though details remain unclear. The policy change will be announced at the autumn Budget, and ministers will only "make decisions we can afford." The move follows criticism from unions and pensioner charities, as well as concerns from Labour MPs about the policy's impact on local election results.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $33 million in FEMA funds for earthquake retrofits in California, prompting criticism from Senator Adam Schiff. The grants were intended to strengthen vulnerable apartment buildings, a measure considered critical due to the state's earthquake risk. FEMA defended the cancellation, citing the program as wasteful and politically motivated, but Schiff argued the move endangers lives and increases displacement risk for vulnerable populations. The funds would have supported retrofits for between 750 and 1,500 apartment buildings.</p>

          <p>The future of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" hinges on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, which has become a point of contention among Republicans. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped the SALT deduction at $10,000, angering Republicans from high-tax states. Trump has since pledged to end the cap, but fiscal conservatives resist raising it, viewing it as subsidizing blue states. An overnight deal to raise the cap to $30,000 has further complicated efforts to pass the bill.</p>

The parliament's committee on legal affairs will review the request to waive their immunity, with a final decision to be made by a vote of all 720 members.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the deportation of eight men to South Sudan "unquestionably" violated his order requiring migrants to have a meaningful opportunity to challenge their removal to third countries. Judge Brian Murphy expressed concern that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) actions were violative of the court's order. The DHS confirmed the aircraft carrying the deportees had landed but did not disclose the location, citing safety concerns. The administration has been working with other countries to accept both their citizens removed from the US, as well as citizens of other nations.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced scrutiny over conflicting statements regarding cuts to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. While Kennedy claimed a team was addressing lead exposure in Milwaukee schools, a senator and the city's health commissioner refuted this. Kennedy's approach to health agencies has been marked by downsizing and restructuring, even in areas he claims are priorities. The contradictions highlight concerns about the impact of the cuts on critical public health efforts, particularly in addressing lead poisoning in children.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin briefly touched a new all-time high before slipping as rising Treasury yields pressured risk assets. The flagship cryptocurrency traded flat at $106,678.74 after reaching $109,857. Factors contributing to the new high included softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The market has benefited from both liquidity and risk-off scenarios, with investors anticipating further regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments. (not investment advice)</p>
