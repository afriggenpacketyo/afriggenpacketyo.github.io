          <p>A 17-year-old male has been arrested in connection with the death of Sunshine Stewart, a 48-year-old paddleboarder in Union, Maine. Stewart's death, caused by strangulation and blunt force trauma, was ruled a homicide after her body was discovered under unusual circumstances in Crawford Pond. Police have not released the suspect's identity or specific charges, but the arrest has brought a sense of relief to the local community, which had been unsettled by rumors and fear following the killing.</p>

          <p>Top Trump administration officials, including the interior secretary and attorney general, have toured the former Alcatraz prison as part of a plan to reopen the facility. The proposal aims to house high-risk criminals on the island, which closed in 1963 and now operates as a major tourist attraction. California leaders, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco's mayor, have strongly condemned the idea, labeling it impractical, exorbitantly expensive, and a "diversionary tactic."</p>

          <p>Netflix announced positive second-quarter financial results, with revenue growing by 16% to $11.08 billion, slightly exceeding analyst expectations. The company's net income rose to $3.1 billion, and it increased its full-year revenue and free cash flow forecasts, citing healthy member growth and ad sales. Despite the strong performance, shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading, likely due to a warning that operating margins will be lower in the second half of the year because of higher content spending.

          <p>Veteran Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party pending an investigation into her recent comments on racism. The suspension follows an interview where she reiterated controversial views, suggesting that racism experienced by Jewish and Traveller communities is different from that faced by Black people due to skin color. This action comes after a previous year-long suspension for similar remarks, and her recent comments have drawn criticism from senior party figures, including the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing internal tensions over the Jeffrey Epstein case, which is complicating their efforts to pass a government spending cuts bill demanded by Donald Trump. Democrats have been using procedural maneuvers to force votes on releasing documents related to Epstein, creating a difficult political situation for Republicans. The controversy, fueled by frustration among some of Trump's base over the administration's handling of the files, has delayed the crucial vote on the spending package.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing mild swelling in his legs. A comprehensive exam, which included a vascular study, ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. Officials described the condition as benign and common for his age, stating the president remains in "excellent health." The announcement also attributed recent bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking combined with his use of aspirin for cardio-vascular prevention.</p>

It argues that while flying has become more mundane and fraught with indignities like cramped seats and extra fees, it has never been a truly glamorous or comfortable experience. Early aviation was dangerous and exposed, and even mid-century travel was expensive, crowded, and lacked modern amenities. The essay concludes that the transformation of a technological miracle into a tedious routine is a natural cycle for any world-changing innovation.</p>

          <p>A multi-billion dollar lawsuit brought by Meta shareholders against Mark Zuckerberg and other executives over the company's handling of privacy breaches has been settled. The lawsuit, filed in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, sought to hold leadership accountable for the financial damages incurred by the company from fines and legal costs. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the agreement brings an end to the case before key figures like Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg were required to testify.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that 23% of Americans over age 50 are now planning to delay their retirement, a significant increase from 14% last year. The primary drivers for this decision are economic volatility and financial uncertainty, with many expressing concerns about inflation and potential market downturns. The findings highlight the financial precarity facing many in Generation X as they approach traditional retirement age, with a separate study noting the median savings for a 55-year-old is only $50,000.

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a Los Angeles woman with faking her own kidnapping by ICE agents in a scheme allegedly designed to generate public sympathy and financial donations. The woman, Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon, claimed she was taken by masked men, sparking a protest by immigrant rights groups. However, an investigation using cellphone records and surveillance footage revealed the story was fabricated. The U.S. Attorney criticized the "dangerous rhetoric" of such hoaxes, which occur amid a climate of fear over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, announcing that Juul can continue selling its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products in the U.S. The agency stated that Juul's studies sufficiently demonstrate that its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. The decision is a major victory for the company, which was widely blamed for fueling the teen vaping crisis, and is certain to face strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups and public health advocates.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court actions indicate its conservative majority strongly supports the president's authority to control federal agencies, including making sharp cuts to staffing and spending. The court has issued brief, unexplained orders siding with the Trump administration against lower court rulings that had blocked layoffs at various departments. This trend is rooted in the "unitary executive theory," which posits that the president has full control over the executive branch, a view that explains why the administration has been successful in its recent appeals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially rescinded $4 billion in federal funding allocated to California's ambitious high-speed rail project. The Department of Transportation cited a lack of a viable path forward for the project, pointing to missed deadlines, budget shortfalls, and a failure to secure billions in additional required funding. California's governor criticized the move, while the transportation secretary defended the decision, stating the project has become a "boondoggle" after 16 years with no track laid and costs soaring to over $128 billion.</p>

          <p>The new animated "Smurfs" movie primarily serves as a vehicle for pop star Rihanna, who voices Smurfette and contributes a new song. The film's plot centers on a nameless Smurf who discovers magical powers, leading to a dimension-hopping chase to prevent the evil wizard Razamel from achieving world domination. According to this article, the movie feels like a modest, kid-friendly cartoon, with a light-hearted but forced tone and stale attempts at humor for adults, ultimately failing to elevate the franchise beyond its Saturday morning origins.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to officially classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under federal law. This change to the Stafford Act would allow states and local governments to request federal disaster assistance from FEMA for heat waves, similar to how they do for hurricanes or floods. Proponents argue this is critical for funding cooling centers, water infrastructure, and adaptation projects, as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, but the idea faces some opposition.</p>
