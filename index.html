          <h2>Trump Administration Alters Annual Global Human Rights Report, Drawing Criticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly revised the annual U.S. report on global human rights, reducing criticism of allies like Israel while increasing it for countries like Brazil. The restructured document eliminates entire sections on issues such as government corruption and LGBTQ+ persecution, which the State Department claims is to improve readability. Critics, including former officials, argue this move abandons core American values and signals that human rights abuses may be overlooked for political expediency. The report also newly criticizes European democracies like the UK for alleged restrictions on free expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on social media, disputing the bank's predictions that his tariffs would harm the economy. Trump asserted that foreign entities, not U.S. consumers, are bearing the costs and suggested Solomon should focus on his past hobby as a DJ rather than leading a major financial institution. This follows a Goldman Sachs report stating that U.S. consumers absorbed a significant portion of tariff costs, with that share potentially rising. Trump's attack is part of a pattern of targeting corporate leaders who disagree with his policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is deliberating whether to revoke the emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children under the age of five. Pfizer confirmed it is in discussions with the agency, emphasizing that the review is not related to the vaccine's safety or efficacy profile. This potential move follows other policy changes by U.S. health agencies under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic. If pulled, it could leave many young children without an available COVID-19 shot, as other vaccines have more limited approval for this age group.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Youngkin stated that federal cooperation under Trump has been crucial for dismantling criminal networks, drawing a parallel to fighting transnational gangs like MS-13. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares contrasted this with the Biden administration, which he claimed was unresponsive to requests for a similar interagency task force. The officials emphasized that tackling human trafficking requires a multi-state and federal approach to be effective.</p>

Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report as flawed due to frequent revisions and suggested relying on more accurate, albeit less timely, quarterly data instead. His nomination follows the firing of the previous BLS commissioner after a jobs report that disappointed the president. The White House has indicated a desire for more trustworthy data, but experts note that declining response rates to government surveys pose a growing challenge for timely economic reporting.

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is establishing a new culture at the club ahead of the season, emphasizing inclusivity and a collective team spirit. In a notable early move, he invited all staff, including non-technical employees, to a first-team meeting to foster a sense of unity. Frank is known for his hands-on, detail-oriented coaching style and a "glass half-full" optimistic personality, which contrasts with his predecessor's approach. While his vision for team spirit is clear, his long-term tactical strategy is still developing amid pre-season challenges, including injuries and the departure of key players.</p>

While Trump pledged to clear homeless encampments and change local laws, these actions fall outside his emergency powers.

Trump initiated the summit in an effort to broker a peace deal, a key promise from his presidential campaign, though Ukrainian officials are not expected to attend. The meeting is viewed by Trump as a "feel-out" to gauge Putin's seriousness, but it has raised concerns in Kyiv and Europe over potential land concessions made without their involvement.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing stability against flexibility. A CD offers a fixed interest rate for a set term, providing guaranteed returns, while a high-yield savings account has a variable rate that can change with market conditions. Current calculations show that for shorter terms like three months, a high-yield account might earn slightly more, whereas for terms of six months to a year, a CD could have the edge. However, for longer terms, the higher variable rate of a savings account could yield more if rates remain stable or rise. (not investment advice)</p>

The experience aims to be fully immersive, featuring 4D elements like haptic seats, environmental effects, and custom scents. Despite the high cost of the project, the strong demand is seen by some analysts as a significant and underappreciated catalyst for the company.</p>

          <p>An ice dam at Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release a massive basin of rainwater and snowmelt, prompting evacuation orders for some residents of Juneau. Officials predict the resulting flood could set a new record, with the Mendenhall River expected to crest significantly higher than in previous years. This phenomenon, known as a glacier outburst flood, has become an annual threat, with floods in 2023 and 2024 causing extensive damage and sweeping away homes. A temporary levee was installed this year to protect over 460 properties, but the long-term threat is expected to persist for decades as the glacier continues to retreat.</p>

          <p>Paraguay is exploring a new law that would allow companies to assemble electronic goods locally using imported components, primarily from China. Government ministers presented the plan to lawmakers, arguing it could create jobs and diversify the economy by taking advantage of global trade tensions. The strategy aims to position Paraguay as an attractive assembly hub, particularly in light of recent U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian exports. This economic proposal is unfolding amid a growing political debate within Paraguay about whether to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to finalize the mechanics of a deal that grants export licenses for China-specific AI chips from Nvidia and AMD in exchange for a 15% tax on those revenues. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt confirmed the arrangement and stated that its legality is still being determined by the Commerce Department. President Trump negotiated the deal directly, viewing it as payment for allowing the companies access to the Chinese market. This move has raised questions among trade law experts regarding the government's authority to implement such a revenue-sharing requirement for export licenses. (not investment advice)</p>

A letter from administration officials stated the goal is to eliminate "improper, divisive or anti-American ideology" ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. This move follows a March executive order from President Trump and places the institution's exhibitions, online content, and curatorial processes under direct political scrutiny.

Kerley immediately announced his intention to challenge the suspension, with his lawyer stating a belief that he was not at fault for at least one of the missed tests. The suspension puts the career of one of the world's top sprinters in jeopardy, following his withdrawal from the U.S. trials in July.</p>
