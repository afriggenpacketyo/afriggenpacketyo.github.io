            <p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration's deregulatory actions would not adversely affect public health or the environment, emphasizing the importance of balancing environmental protection with economic growth. Zeldin argued that previous regulations under the Biden administration were too broad and costly, impacting the American economy. He encouraged public participation in the upcoming deregulatory process, ensuring common sense is applied to environmental regulations. Zeldin highlighted the public's focus on economic concerns and the need to reduce compliance costs, amounting to trillions of dollars. Optimism Score: 70</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, prompting Solicitor General John Sauer to call the order "unprecedented."

He emphasized the absence of lower court findings on the government's notice and appeal process for AEA detainees. Sauer urged limiting the order to AEA removals only, not all Venezuelan gang member deportations. Optimism Score: 50</p>

Van Hollen countered that he is defending due process rights, not the individual, and that the administration has presented no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13 in federal court.
