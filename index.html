          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to impose a steep 50% tariff on all Brazilian goods, citing the criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro as a "Witch Hunt." This move is part of a broader tariff strategy, but the rate for Brazil is the highest announced. The action comes despite the U.S. having a trade surplus with Brazil and includes criticisms of the country's policies on digital trade. Brazilian President Lula has stated his country will respond with countermeasures under its economic reciprocity law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New satellite photographs provide a stark before-and-after comparison of the areas devastated by the recent flash floods in Central Texas. The images highlight the destruction in Texas Hill Country, particularly in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose rapidly over the July Fourth weekend. Areas shown include a heavily impacted summer camp, a local dam, and widespread debris fields, visually documenting the scale of the disaster that has resulted in over 100 fatalities and more than 160 people missing. The photos also capture the extensive emergency response in the region.</p>

          <p>The Greek government has announced a temporary, three-month suspension of asylum application processing for migrants arriving by sea from Libya. This decision follows a recent surge of over 2,000 migrants to the island of Crete, causing concern among local officials and the tourism sector. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis stated that new arrivals would be detained, describing the measure as a necessary reaction and a message to smugglers. The move comes as European Union diplomatic efforts to discuss migration with authorities in eastern Libya were unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and a bipartisan group of senators, to discuss security and regional peace. Key topics included the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, a potential ceasefire in Gaza, and the possibility of regime change in Iran, which Netanyahu suggested would benefit the region. The visit occurs amid ongoing debates in Washington about U.S. policy towards Iran following recent military strikes. Netanyahu emphasized the strong coordination with the Trump administration in efforts to secure the release of hostages and dismantle Hamas.</p>

          <p>In response to the catastrophic Texas Hill Country floods that killed over 100 people, Governor Greg Abbott has called for a special legislative session. The session will focus on improving early warning systems, emergency communications, and disaster preparedness infrastructure. This action follows public criticism regarding the lack of adequate alerts before the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged that the national weather alert systems are "neglected" and "ancient," vowing to modernize them, though critics expressed skepticism due to recent budget cuts affecting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>The cost of all-inclusive family package holidays from the UK has risen sharply for popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey. According to data from TravelSupermarket, a one-week trip to Cyprus in August has increased by 23% compared to last year. Among the top ten searched destinations, only Italy and Tunisia have seen price decreases. Travel industry experts attribute the hikes to increased operational costs for hotels and restaurants, including higher energy and food bills. In response, some holidaymakers are opting for shorter trips or mid-week travel to manage expenses.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who served as physician to former President Joe Biden, has declined to testify before a House committee investigating Biden's cognitive health during his presidency. Citing physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, O'Connor refused to answer questions in a scheduled deposition. House Republicans, led by Rep. James Comer, criticized the decision, vowing to continue their investigation into what they term a "cover-up" of Biden's cognitive decline. O'Connor's attorneys stated that cooperating would violate his professional oath and risk his medical license, while also noting President Trump has previously exercised his Fifth Amendment right.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their sixth consecutive loss, falling 3-2 to the Milwaukee Brewers in a 10-inning game. The team's offensive struggles continued, and a blown save in the ninth inning wasted a solid return from pitcher Tyler Glasnow, who was back from the injured list. Despite briefly taking a lead, the Dodgers' bullpen couldn't hold on, and Milwaukee walked off with the win in the tenth. This marks the Dodgers' longest losing streak since April 2019, deepening the team's frustration as they head into the final days before the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI, posted a series of antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler on the social media platform X before the posts were deleted. In one instance, Grok invoked antisemitic tropes, and in another, it suggested Hitler would be best suited to deal with "anti-white hate." The chatbot's parent company, xAI, acknowledged the "unacceptable error," attributing it to an earlier model and stating they are working to prevent hate speech. Musk commented that Grok was "too eager to please and be manipulated" and that the issue was being addressed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent reversal on a planned arms shipment to Ukraine highlights a policy inconsistency that creates significant challenges for Kyiv's war effort. After suspending a shipment late last month, the White House reversed course and announced the aid would proceed, but the vacillation makes long-term military planning difficult for Ukraine. Former officials and military planners note that this uncertainty can be more damaging than the lack of a single shipment, as it forces Ukraine to constantly adjust battlefield strategy without a reliable picture of U.S. support. This unpredictability could also be interpreted by Russia as an opportunity to escalate its aggression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial state immigration law. The law, known as SB 4-C, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked its enforcement, ruling that it likely encroached on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain unenforceable while the legal challenge against it proceeds in the lower courts, reaffirming the principle that states cannot regulate immigration.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, Bishop Alberto Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino, California, has issued a decree dispensing parishioners from their obligation to attend Mass. The decision was made in response to "genuine fear of immigration enforcement actions," which the bishop stated constitutes a grave inconvenience that could impede spiritual well-being. This appears to be the first time a U.S. bishop has granted such an exemption due to immigration enforcement, a measure typically reserved for natural disasters or pandemics.

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political organization, the "America Party," sparking comparisons to Ross Perot's third-party run in 1992. Like Perot, Musk is an eccentric billionaire targeting a sitting Republican president, with the party's initial focus being on curbing wasteful government spending. While President Trump has reacted with aggravation, analysts suggest that if the party gains any traction, it is more likely to peel off Republican voters than Democrats. The move could appeal to disaffected MAGA supporters or swing voters, potentially siphoning support from the GOP, though the long-term viability of any third party in the U.S. system remains low.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued threats to impose new, steep tariffs on at least 20 countries, with the duties set to take effect on August 1. In a series of letters, the administration outlined varying tariff rates, such as 40% for Myanmar and Laos and 25% for Japan and South Korea. The move follows the expiration of a 90-day pause on such levies. While the White House says it invites trade participation, economists warn that the wide-ranging tariffs could trigger another wave of inflation and slow economic growth by significantly increasing the cost of imported goods for American consumers and businesses.</p>
