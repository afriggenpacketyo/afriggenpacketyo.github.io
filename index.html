          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade deal, setting a 15% tariff on most South Korean goods, a reduction from the threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will invest $350 billion in selected U.S. industries, including shipbuilding and semiconductors, and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. While Seoul successfully protected its sensitive beef and rice markets from further opening, the deal has been criticized for negating the benefits of the existing U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing analyst expectations. The decline was driven by a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial semiconductor division, attributed to inventory adjustments and export restrictions. Despite the downturn, the company's mobile division saw increased sales, and leadership expressed optimism for a recovery in the second half of the year, fueled by demand in AI and robotics.

Ryanair's leadership called for the resignation of the NATS CEO, citing a failure to learn from past incidents.

While overall earnings met expectations, the company's net income dropped 42% from the previous year. CEO Rene Haas also confirmed that Arm is exploring designing its own processors or chiplets, a strategic shift that could turn its current customers into competitors and introduces new execution risks. The move is intended to provide better starting points for clients like cloud service providers. (not investment advice)</p>

Sub-indexes for employment and new orders also showed contraction. Authorities attribute the decline to seasonal factors and extreme weather, while top leaders have not signaled any plans for major new economic stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, generated tsunami waves that prompted warnings and advisories across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast.

Experts noted that a tsunami is a series of waves that can continue for hours, posing a prolonged risk of dangerous currents even if initial wave heights are small. The powerful quake also appeared to trigger a volcanic eruption on the peninsula.</p>

          <h2>Explainer: The Science Behind How Earthquakes Generate Tsunamis</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Russia, experts explain the science behind how such events create tsunamis. A tsunami is typically generated by a strong underwater earthquake, usually at least a magnitude 6.5, that causes a vertical shift in the seafloor. This displacement creates a series of powerful waves that can travel across deep oceans at the speed of a jet airliner. As the waves approach shallower coastal waters, they slow down and increase dramatically in height, releasing immense energy and causing destructive flooding, as this article details.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Thriving Communities of Life in Deep Pacific Ocean Trenches</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:02:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The Chinese-led research team observed dense beds of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these "chemosynthetic" communities may be widespread in the planet's deepest trenches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of scientists are challenging the widely held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains, arguing that the scientific evidence is often flawed and inconclusive. Researchers like psychologist Pete Etchells point out that many studies rely on unreliable self-reporting and fail to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some studies link high social media use to depression, others find little to no connection between screen time and poor mental health, suggesting factors like loneliness may be more significant. This scientific uncertainty complicates guidance for parents.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used near-infrared digital photography to reveal the stunningly intricate tattoos on a 2,500-year-old "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution images show detailed decorations of mythical creatures and animals that were previously difficult to see, showcasing a high level of sophistication. The analysis suggests the tattoos were likely made using a multi-pointed tool, possibly from animal bone, and a stencil. The discovery provides a closer look at the personal life and cultural practices of these ancient nomadic people.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become a veteran leader, or "Yoda," in the Los Angeles Rams' young secondary. After joining the team mid-season last year and earning a starting role, Witherspoon was re-signed to a one-year deal, providing stability to the defensive backfield. The 30-year-old is embracing his role as a mentor to younger players, recognizing that his experience is crucial for a defense that features an ascending front line. He expressed confidence that the combination of the team's defensive talent will be "special" this season.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has ignited between France and Spain after a group of French Jewish teenagers was removed from a Vueling flight in Valencia. French ministers condemned the "brutal" handcuffing of the group's female leader by Spanish police and a now-deleted social media post from a Spanish minister calling the teens "Israeli brats." The airline claims the group was removed for disruptive behavior, including mishandling safety equipment, an account disputed by other passengers and the group's lawyer, who suggested antisemitism was a factor. Vueling and the Spanish police have denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>NBA veteran Marcus Morris Sr. has been released from a Florida jail after being arrested on felony fraud and theft warrants from Nevada. The charges stemmed from two unpaid casino markers, each for over $100,000. Morris was held for more than two days before being released, reportedly after a large payment was wired to resolve the debts. In a social media post, Morris stated the "money paid back and lesson learned," but objected to being portrayed as a fraud, claiming the issue was a matter of delayed payment, not an inability to pay.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched a major recruitment campaign, using patriotic messaging and signing bonuses of up to $50,000 to hire thousands of new staff. The push to add 10,000 new deportation officers, investigators, and lawyers is funded by a recent congressional appropriation aimed at expanding immigration enforcement. The campaign aims to help the administration reach its goal of one million annual deportations. However, the rapid expansion has raised concerns among former officials about potentially lowered hiring standards and a lack of proper oversight.</p>
