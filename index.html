          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 07:30:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are taking a more cautious approach to summer vacations this year due to trade tensions and recession fears, leading to scaled-back spending plans, according to a Deloitte report. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, they are opting for more budget-conscious choices, such as cutting back on in-destination spending and choosing cheaper lodging options. Travel costs, including hotel rates and airfares, have generally declined, providing some relief to travelers seeking to stretch their budgets. Despite lower prices, inflation continues to impact spending habits, prompting travelers to seek flexibility in their plans to save money.</p>

          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, which significantly boosted Strategy's market capitalization, is now being adopted by various companies, including meme stock firms and media conglomerates. Despite this growing trend, Wall Street remains skeptical, with shares of Trump Media and GameStop declining after their bitcoin-related announcements. Saylor, however, views this as a long-term shift in corporate finance, noting increasing interest in bitcoin treasury companies globally. The Trump administration has also taken steps to treat bitcoin as a long-term store of value, further legitimizing its role in the financial landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In a move signaling improved relations, Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to elevate their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing, where Chinese officials expressed their willingness to assist in improving relations between the two countries. Relations have been strained due to accusations that Kabul harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. Despite this upgrade, no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021, though a handful of countries have agreed to host Taliban government ambassadors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that media coverage of NPR's lawsuit against President Trump over defunding attempts is biased. The article claims that NPR's lawyers arrogantly argued that Trump's actions violated the First Amendment, requiring conservatives to fund speech they oppose. The author points to examples of what they perceive as liberal bias in NPR's reporting and interviews, including an interview with Harvard's president and coverage of NPR "founding mothers." The piece concludes by asserting that there is no objectivity or balance on NPR, citing an investigation that found a significant disparity in voter registration among NPR news employees.</p>

          <p>Employees at the U.S. Department of Energy are raising concerns that budget cuts and deregulation are undermining the department's ability to function effectively, potentially leading to increased energy costs for consumers. Proposed budget cuts and the elimination of energy efficiency standards are expected to negatively impact household utility bills and hinder energy innovation. Morale within the department has reportedly declined due to attacks on civil servants and the departure of numerous employees. Critics argue that these actions will result in lawsuits, legal challenges, and negative impacts on renewable energy research and development, ultimately raising prices for consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is entering the Atlantic hurricane season with significant staffing gaps due to recent federal job cuts, raising concerns among meteorologists about the agency's ability to provide accurate and timely forecasts.

The Weather Service has updated its service level standards and is attempting to transfer staff to understaffed locations, but experts warn that this may not be a sustainable solution.

          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's use of antisemitism as a justification for repressive policies on college campuses. They are protesting the administration's funding cuts, demands for universities to curtail academic freedom, and the detention of pro-Palestinian students. These Jewish organizers argue that the administration's actions do not represent their Jewish values and that they are being used to silence criticism of Israel. They emphasize the need for nuanced discussions about Israel, antisemitism, and Jewish identity, while condemning the exploitation of antisemitism for political gain.</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked discussion among experts about whether the U.S. may follow suit. While some see it as a potential solution to Social Security's looming funding challenges, others argue that it may not be suitable for the U.S. due to income inequality and disparities in life expectancy. Raising the retirement age could disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who already receive benefits for a shorter period. Experts also note that phasing in such a change would take time, making it less effective in addressing immediate funding needs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic asserts that President Trump and the MAGA movement have abandoned the principles of constitutional conservatism, displaying a disdain for laws, procedures, and the Constitution. The author argues that Trump seeks to empower the federal government for his own purposes, disregarding checks and balances and individual liberty. The piece contends that the Trump administration has embraced a philosophy of "might makes right," with laws and the Constitution being malleable to serve its agenda. The author concludes by warning that America is heading toward a form of authoritarianism under Trump's leadership.</p>

The lawmakers claim that CalRecycle exceeded its authority by proposing regulations that contradict the statute, specifically regarding polluting recycling technologies and exemptions for products under USDA and FDA purview. They fear that these regulations could increase costs and allow producers to unilaterally determine which products are subject to the law.

Attorneys for the Board of Parole are reviewing inmate files to identify cases where a new hearing is warranted, with concerns raised about the impact on inmates seeking medical treatment for addictions.

Some critics view Trump's pardons as "transactional" and influenced by powerful individuals, rather than driven by a coherent drug policy philosophy.

The project, initially drawn up in 1990, faced enormous overspends, major delays, and a global pandemic.
