            <p>A Japanese bus driver with 29 years of service was fired and lost his $84,000 retirement package after being caught stealing $7 from passenger fares. Despite initially winning a lawsuit arguing the punishment was excessive, the Supreme Court overturned the verdict, ruling that the man's conduct could undermine public trust. The city hailed the decision, emphasizing the importance of maintaining public trust in employees handling public money.</p>

Trump's trade war, cuts to scientific funding, and restrictions on immigration have jeopardized the US's economic performance and its leadership in innovation. Despite receiving regulatory relief, the tech right's investment in Trump has proven to be a disaster for their stated objectives.</p>
