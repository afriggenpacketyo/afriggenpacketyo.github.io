          <p>World-leading battery scientist Guo Zaiping has left her long-held position in Australia to join City University of Hong Kong as a chair professor of energy materials. Her research, particularly in advanced materials for energy storage, is considered crucial for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries. This work has significant implications for the electric vehicle industry, potentially leading to substantial improvements in driving range and performance. Her move is a notable gain for Hong Kong's academic and scientific community, which aims to be a leader in materials science.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning reforms to licensing rules aimed at protecting pubs and music venues from noise complaints that threaten their operation. The proposed changes would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing measures. Additionally, the plan seeks to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas in designated locations. The government hopes these measures will revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry, though critics argue other government policies have harmed the sector.</p>

          <p>A stampede at the Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar, northern India, has resulted in the deaths of at least six people and injuries to more than 30 others. The incident reportedly occurred when a high-voltage electric wire fell onto a path, causing panic among the thousands of devotees gathered at the popular Hindu pilgrimage site. This tragic event is one of several deadly stampedes that have occurred in India this year, highlighting ongoing concerns about crowd management and safety at large religious gatherings. Authorities have launched rescue operations and are investigating the cause.</p>

          <p>Ghana's President John Mahama has initiated a "24-hour economy" policy, a cornerstone of his plan to revive and diversify the nation's economy. The strategy involves transitioning key industries like agriculture and manufacturing to operate in three eight-hour shifts daily, aiming to create jobs and shift Ghana from an import-based to a self-sufficient economy. However, economists express skepticism, pointing to significant hurdles such as the need for billions in funding and inadequate infrastructure, including reliable power. The success of this ambitious vision will depend on securing private sector investment and overcoming these practical challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The MEK is designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, though it was delisted by the US and EU in 2012.

The official, Huang Qiang, called for a clear explanation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, referring to them by their Chinese names (Fuyu, Gaogouli, Bohai) rather than their Korean ones (Buyeo, Goguryeo, Balhae). The history of these kingdoms is a contentious issue, with both nations claiming them as part of their heritage. This call to assert a specific historical narrative could strain diplomatic relations between Beijing and Seoul.</p>

          <h2>China's Suppression of News on Deadly Attacks Prompts Online Complaints from Citizens</h2>

          <p>The Chinese government has been increasingly suppressing information about mass casualty attacks, such as stabbings or vehicle rammings, a shift from its previous practice of releasing basic details. Recent incidents near schools have seen news reports quickly scrubbed from the internet and replaced with vague police statements that omit key facts. This growing censorship, aimed at preventing unrest and copycat crimes, is facing pushback from some Chinese citizens who are taking to social media to demand transparency and the truth. The trend highlights the tension between the state's desire for information control and the public's right to know.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival, civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration names RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo as president and directly challenges the legitimacy of the internationally recognized army-led government. This development raises fears of a permanent partition of the nation, with the army controlling the north and east while the RSF holds sway in Darfur and other regions. The UN has warned this could further fragment Sudan and undermine peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has made phone calls to the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, urging an immediate ceasefire to their recent deadly border clashes. Both nations thanked him for his efforts, with Cambodia agreeing to the ceasefire and Thailand stressing the need for dialogue first. However, shelling reportedly continued along the border despite the intervention. Trump linked the restoration of peace to the resumption of trade talks, as U.S. tariffs on both countries are set to take effect soon. The intervention comes after weeks of fighting that has killed dozens and displaced thousands.</p>

          <p>Turkey has recorded its highest temperature in history, hitting 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as a severe heatwave grips much of the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures soaring well above seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with dry conditions and strong winds, has fueled dozens of disastrous wildfires across Turkey, forcing evacuations in several provinces, including near the popular resort city of Antalya. Neighboring countries like Greece are also battling major blazes as the entire region swelters under the prolonged extreme weather event.</p>

          <p>Despite starting the game with back-to-back home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately fell to the Boston Red Sox 4-2. Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet settled down after the rocky start, striking out ten and preventing further damage over six innings. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled to hold the early lead, giving up three runs in the second inning and another in the fifth. The Dodgers' efforts to rally were also hampered by several runners being thrown out on the basepaths, leading to a frustrating loss at Fenway Park.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of China's "low-altitude economy," which includes drones and other aerial activities below 1,000 meters, has spurred the creation of new specialized jobs. China's Ministry of Human Resources has officially designated "drone flight planner" as a new occupation. These professionals are responsible for planning complex multi-drone flight paths, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. This development reflects Beijing's strategic focus on this emerging industry as a key driver for innovation, job creation, and future economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
