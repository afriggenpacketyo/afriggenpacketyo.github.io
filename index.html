            <h2>Buffett Camp Denies Trump Tariff Endorsement</h2>

            <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway refuted social media reports claiming Buffett endorsed President Trump's tariff policies. The statement came after Trump shared a video suggesting Buffett praised his economic moves, which Berkshire Hathaway denied. Buffett has publicly stated that tariffs tend to increase prices and could lead to a trade war, potentially harming the global economy. He has also described tariffs as "an act of war, to some degree."</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates experienced a sharp increase, reaching a one-month high due to market uncertainty stemming from President Trump's newly announced global tariffs. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped significantly, reversing previous declines. The bond market, mirroring the stock market's volatility, influenced mortgage rates, which loosely follow the 10-year Treasury yield. Market analysts suggest the initial rate drop was an overreaction to economic fears, and rates are now stabilizing as officials discuss tariff negotiations.</p>

            <p>Representative Melanie Stansbury, a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of a "fire sale approach" in offloading federal real estate, while Republicans aim to reduce government spending. Stansbury alleges that the administration is stripping the government for parts to pay for tax cuts, while Republicans highlight cost-cutting efforts by the General Services Administration (GSA), which have resulted in lease terminations and taxpayer savings. The debate also includes criticism of Elon Musk's involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and potential conflicts of interest related to government contracts.</p>

The survey indicates that most Americans disapprove of the U.S. taking over Greenland or Gaza, ending USAID programs, withdrawing from the WHO, and leaving the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, a significant percentage believes Trump favors Russia too much. These findings highlight a divergence between Trump's foreign policy decisions and public sentiment.</p>

            <p>President Trump is touting falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive signs of his tariff policy, but experts caution that these trends indicate expectations of an economic slowdown. Lower oil prices suggest diminished energy demand due to potential recession, while falling Treasury yields reflect investors seeking safe-haven assets. While these trends may offer some near-term relief to consumers, experts warn they are not necessarily indicators of a healthy economy. Oil prices and Treasury yields ticked up slightly on Tuesday as the Trump administration signaled negotiations with some countries targeted by tariffs.</p>
