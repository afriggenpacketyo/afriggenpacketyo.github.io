          <p>Under the Trump administration, opportunities for student loan forgiveness are diminishing, with the SAVE repayment plan likely to be dismantled. The Education Department is arguing that a court ruling requires ending loan forgiveness under repayment plans beyond SAVE. While the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program remains intact, changes are possible, and borrowers are advised to maintain thorough documentation of their payments and employment. The Teacher Loan Forgiveness program remains as another option, but it cannot be combined with PSLF. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a conscious parenting coach, telling a child "You're okay" when they are upset can be detrimental to their emotional development. This phrase can invalidate their feelings, teach them to doubt their emotions, and short-circuit emotional processing. Instead of building resilience, it can lead to emotional avoidance and condition children to suppress their emotions to remain accepted. It can also rewire a child's stress response, making it harder for them to trust, regulate, and feel safe being themselves.</p>

          <p>Iran and the US are engaged in the third round of nuclear talks in Muscat, Oman, aiming for a breakthrough on Iran's nuclear program. These talks are focused on building trust and providing assurances regarding Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. A successful agreement could lower the risk of conflict and potentially ease economic sanctions on Iran. Key challenges include conflicting signals from US officials and deep mistrust between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Amazon and Nvidia have indicated that all energy sources, including fossil fuels, are being considered to power artificial intelligence data centers. This comes as the tech industry acknowledges the growing energy demands of AI and navigates a changing political landscape under President Trump, who supports increased fossil fuel production. While both companies remain committed to reducing carbon emissions, they recognize the need for reliable power to meet customer demands in the near term. The possibility of using coal was met with unease by some, but other options are being explored.</p>
