        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin reached a new record high, trading above $113,000 and continuing a rally from the previous day. The surge is attributed to a broader investor appetite for risk assets and a significant volume of short position liquidations, which exceeded $318 million in 24 hours. This price increase, fueled by both institutional buying and ETF inflows, has also lifted other cryptocurrencies, with altcoins like Ether and Dogecoin seeing notable gains. The momentum follows a period of stable trading above the $100,000 mark for over two months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a state visit to London, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled several key agreements. The centerpiece is a "one in, one out" pilot program for returning migrants who arrive in small boats to France, in exchange for the UK accepting an equal number of asylum seekers with family ties. The leaders also committed to ordering more Storm Shadow missiles for Ukraine and establishing a new European-led military headquarters in Paris. Additionally, Macron advocated for a joint recognition of a Palestinian state to promote peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in New York has affirmed the $5 million civil verdict against Donald Trump for the sexual abuse and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll. The unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel found no errors in the original trial's proceedings that would justify a new trial. This verdict, from May 2023, found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and defaming her in 2022. Trump is separately appealing another, larger verdict of $83.3 million for different defamatory statements made while he was president.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for 850,318 Ford and Lincoln vehicles because of a faulty low-pressure fuel pump that can fail during operation, potentially causing the engine to stall. The issue increases the risk of a crash, although no injuries have been reported. The recall affects various models from 2021-2023, including the F-150, Bronco, and Explorer. Ford has not yet determined a remedy but will notify owners starting July 14, with a second letter to follow when a solution is available.</p>

During a flood, the primary rule is to never walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters, as just six inches of moving water can sweep a person away. After the storm, residents should wait for an all-clear from authorities before returning home and check for structural damage and electrical hazards.</p>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers using Certificates of Deposit (CDs) should be more strategic. This article warns against three key errors: assuming CD rates will only drop after official Fed action, as banks often adjust rates preemptively; prioritizing high short-term rates over locking in a solid long-term rate that protects against future cuts; and failing to calculate potential earnings and penalties before committing funds. Proactive planning is crucial to maximize returns in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's trade war, particularly the removal of a key tax exemption for low-value shipments, has challenged Asian e-commerce giants Temu and Shein. While new tariffs have eroded their price advantage, some analysts believe their highly flexible, low-cost business models will allow them to adapt and remain formidable competitors to Amazon. These companies can manufacture and distribute products cheaply and have been shifting to U.S.-based warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. Their future success in the U.S. market, however, still largely depends on the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With prices for summer travel soaring, there are several strategies to keep costs down for a holiday abroad. Experts advise booking trips for July and August as early as possible and flying mid-week on early morning flights, which are typically cheaper. For accommodation, last-minute deals can be found on package holidays, and house-swapping presents a low-cost alternative. When spending abroad, paying in the local currency on a card is usually more economical than exchanging cash at the airport. Finally, weighing luggage and pre-ordering toiletries for airport pickup can help avoid extra fees.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has proposed a rule change that would relax the criteria for a financial institution to be considered "well-managed." Under the new proposal, a bank could still meet the standard even with one "deficient" rating across the categories of capital, liquidity, and governance. This status is crucial as it allows banks to engage in activities like acquisitions. The move, supported by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, drew immediate criticism from her predecessor Michael Barr, who argued it would weaken safeguards and introduce greater risk to the banking system.

          <p>The new film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, offers a bracing look at a white family's life in 1980s Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a civil war. Directed by Embeth Davidtz, the story is told through the eyes of 7-year-old Bobo (Lexi Venter), who navigates a childhood filled with racial tension, political uncertainty, and casual violence. The film powerfully contrasts the child's naive perspective with the harsh realities of the era, exploring themes of colonialism and entitlement. The review praises the film's unflinching tone and the astonishing lead performance by the young Venter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to complement and enhance Social Security benefits for retirees. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, thereby maximizing their monthly government payout. This strategy creates a reliable "paycheck" that covers essential expenses and fills income gaps left by Social Security alone. Furthermore, certain types of annuities can offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income and helping manage overall financial risk in retirement.

          <p>While the newly announced UK-France migrant returns deal sounds simple, its implementation is fraught with potential legal, political, and practical challenges. The pilot scheme, which involves returning one migrant to France for every asylum seeker the UK accepts, is based on a sound legal principle. However, it will likely face legal challenges over the fairness of its selection process. Politically, the UK must convince EU nations that migrants won't end up in their territory, and practically, determining who qualifies to be sent to the UK could be difficult. The small scale of the pilot may not be a significant deterrent initially.</p>
