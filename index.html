          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi addressed employee concerns regarding the company's decision to increase in-office requirements and alter sabbatical eligibility. At an all-hands meeting, Khosrowshahi stated that the changes were a risk the company decided to take for the sake of collaboration, innovation, and company culture, and that Uber needs to be on its A game as a Gen-AI powered company. He apologized to employees who were negatively impacted, but emphasized the need for employees to focus on learning and their impact on the company rather than benefits. Khosrowshahi denied that the changes were aimed at cost cutting or driving attrition. </p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) journalists are protesting being silenced by the US government, following an executive order aimed at dismantling their parent company. Journalists claim that their broadcasts went dark for the first time since WWII, and that hundreds of VOA journalists remain shut out of their newsroom. The Trump administration has defended the decision to cut the broadcasters as part of its effort to downsize the federal government and slash what it described as "frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American values or address the needs of the American people". Press freedom advocates warn that this action rewards dictators and despots and undermines the US's ability to counter disinformation in unfree societies.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. By removing the HMGB1 gene, irrigated rice developed longer, thicker roots, similar to upland rice, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments. This discovery could significantly improve food security by allowing rice cultivation in regions facing water scarcity, and the researchers published their findings in the journal Molecular Plant. This advancement addresses a critical need for drought-resistant crops amid increasing climate challenges.</p>

          <p>Despite negative economic news, including a contraction in first-quarter GDP, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Mortgage interest rates dropped slightly for the second straight week, but applications for home purchases rose significantly, particularly for conventional loans. The increase in demand for conventional loans, typically sought by move-up buyers, was a surprising move given lingering economic uncertainty.

          <p>A three-judge panel of the US Court of International Trade will hear a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, with small businesses arguing that the tariffs are illegal. The plaintiffs argue that the tariffs are economically significant, reducing the average US household's income, and lack justification as an emergency measure. Former Republican officials have filed an amicus brief against the tariffs, but the court's decision remains uncertain due to the novelty of the major questions doctrine.

          <p>A report indicates that the IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors following cost-cutting measures implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This reduction in auditors, who handle complex cases involving wealthy taxpayers and corporations, raises concerns about the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue. While DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, critics argue that the savings are offset by lost productivity, re-hiring costs, and potential revenue loss due to decreased tax compliance. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to these cuts.</p>

The move is viewed as a softening of Chinaâ€™s previous refusal to negotiate under duress, with officials emphasizing de-escalation over immediate deals. Both countries seem interested in reducing tariffs, but neither wants to make the initial concession, and the Chinese side will likely treat the talks as a fact-finding mission.</p>

          <p>Despite advancements in AI, human forecasters still outperform machines in predicting future events, according to recent forecasting tournaments. AI models struggle with quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills, but are improving rapidly. AI's potential to analyze unstructured data quickly could be useful in various fields, but trust in AI forecasts remains a challenge. While the world may not currently demand human superforecasting, AI superforecasting may have a big impact if it can forecast better than the best humans today.</p>

          <p>Sixteen people, including a Sinaloa cartel leader, have been arrested in what is being called the largest fentanyl bust in DEA history. The operation spanned several states in the West and resulted in the seizure of three million fentanyl-laced pills, over 400 kilograms of fentanyl pills, and other narcotics. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the individuals, if convicted, will remain in American prisons, possibly Alcatraz, and the Justice Department said that drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 44.</p>

The German economy is struggling, relations with the Trump administration are strained, and the far-right AfD party has gained traction. Merz's initial failure to secure enough votes in Parliament highlights the fragility of his coalition, which could complicate his agenda of tightening borders, modernizing bureaucracy, and increasing military spending. This instability may also impact Germany's role in leading Europe.</p>
