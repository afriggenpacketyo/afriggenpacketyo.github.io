          <p>Hong Kong's IPO market has seen a strong resurgence in 2025, providing investors with impressive returns exceeding 30%, despite a sluggish economy and property sector. Data indicates that holding new shares from the 34 companies that have launched IPOs this year would result in an average return of 34%. The attractive returns have drawn institutional investors back to the Asian stock market, and individual investors are shifting from the struggling property market to capitalize on the IPO boom using financial leverage. This shift highlights the potential for significant gains in the IPO market amidst broader economic challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are proposing to sell off the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) new electric vehicle (EV) mail trucks and cancel the contract for the remaining deliveries. This provision, included in a bill enacting President Trump's agenda, aims to cut costs and refocus USPS on mail delivery rather than environmental initiatives. However, USPS officials argue that selling the EVs would cost more to replace them and would cripple the agency's ability to modernize its aging fleet, highlighting a conflict between environmental goals and fiscal conservatism.</p>

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London is set to display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. This labrador-sized dinosaur was initially misclassified but is now recognized as a distinct species, offering insights into the evolution of small dinosaurs into larger forms. The Enigmacursor's unique features, including its leg bones, differentiate it from other dinosaurs of the Late Jurassic period. The discovery underscores the importance of accurate species identification in understanding dinosaur diversity and evolutionary pathways.</p>

          <p>The article examines how voters' attitudes toward scandal have shifted, enabling politicians like Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump to make comebacks despite past controversies. Factors contributing to this trend include a changing perception of sex scandals, the cognitive load of processing multiple scandals, and increasing political polarization. The author suggests that while scandals can still hurt a politician's electability, they are now just one factor in a cost-benefit analysis for voters. The article argues that voters are now more willing to overlook misdeeds if they believe a candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose the rival's worldview.</p>

          <p>Mar de Copas, a Peruvian rock band with 34 years of existence, is embarking on its first U.S. tour, aiming to break the curse that has hindered the international recognition of Peruvian rock bands. The tour follows a European tour that included performances in Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, and Milan. The band acknowledges the social and political instability in the U.S., but emphasizes that Mar de Copas has never been a political band and does not intend to address such themes.

          <p>The Trump administration has authorized a $30 million grant to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial aid organization linked to private security contractors. GHF has been accused of "politicizing" food distribution in Gaza and faces criticism for its close ties to the Israeli government. The decision to issue the grant has raised ethical concerns and objections from career staff within the State Department. Advocates have warned that private contractors operating in Gaza in collaboration with the Israeli government risk complicity in crimes under international law.</p>
