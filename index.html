          <p>Russia's military claimed to have neutralized over 55 Ukrainian drones in an overnight attack across its southern regions, resulting in several injuries and property damage. The assault occurred as the United States signaled increased pressure on Moscow, with President Trump announcing new tariffs and additional weapons for Ukraine. Meanwhile, diplomatic activities intensified, with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping to bolster their alliance. These developments highlight the escalating military and diplomatic conflict, with both sides seeking to strengthen their positions through force and international partnerships.</p>

          <p>U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a crucial speech as investors grow concerned about the nation's slowing economy and government debt approaching 100% of GDP. Markets are looking for clear strategies to fill a growing fiscal hole ahead of the Autumn Budget, with speculation about potential tax increases on financial services or wealthy individuals. Reeves is also expected to announce an overhaul of the pensions system to manage rising costs, though she has committed to maintaining the politically sensitive "triple lock" protection. The address is seen as a critical test of the government's ability to restore confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a phone interview, U.S. President Donald Trump described himself as "disappointed but not done" with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing frustration over stalled ceasefire negotiations for Ukraine. The conversation came hours after Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a deal is not reached within 50 days. Trump conveyed that while he has attempted to secure a peace agreement multiple times, Russia's continued aggression, such as bombing Kyiv, has undermined these efforts. He also reaffirmed his support for NATO, a significant shift from his previous criticisms of the alliance.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a new scheme offering drivers discounts of up to £3,750 to encourage the purchase of new electric cars. The grants, part of a £650 million fund, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are intended to help meet the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, critics and industry figures point to the insufficient number of public charging points as a major barrier to adoption. The move has sparked political debate, with the opposition arguing it forces a product on consumers before the necessary infrastructure is ready.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that for the United States to lead the global AI revolution, it must leverage its abundant natural gas resources to meet the immense energy demands of data centers. The author contends that relying solely on renewable energy is impractical at the required scale and that a pragmatic approach is needed to prevent AI innovation from moving overseas to countries like China. By co-locating gas-powered generation with data centers, the U.S. can provide affordable, reliable electricity without straining the public grid. The piece praises the Trump administration's focus on this strategy as vital for economic strength and national security.</p>

His departure, described as "quite sudden," is anticipated to follow an upcoming EU-China summit. Kvarnström, a fluent Chinese speaker and former Swedish diplomat, has been a key figure in shaping the EU's China policy and was instrumental in organizing the bloc's first Indo-Pacific summit in 2023. Insiders suggest his exit will create a significant void within the EU's diplomatic apparatus concerning China, leaving a major role to be filled at a critical time.</p>

Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, solidifying his position at the top of the sport.

President Putin has declared population growth a national priority, but births fell to their lowest level since 1999 last year.

The test simulated key mission phases for the rocket's powerful nine-engine first stage, which held up under all conditions. This success marks a significant milestone for the company, especially after a mishap a year ago when the rocket unexpectedly lifted off during a similar static-fire test and crashed. The Tianlong-3 is designed to be reusable, and proving the structural integrity of its tail section is crucial for its future missions in the competitive commercial launch market.</p>

          <p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has revealed plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build massive AI data centers across the United States in a push for "superintelligence." The first of these multi-gigawatt facilities, named Prometheus, is slated to be operational in 2026, with another, Hyperion, planned for Louisiana. One of the proposed sites is described as covering an area nearly the size of Manhattan, underscoring the immense scale of the investment. This move signals Meta's ambition to be a leader in the AI race, though it also raises concerns about the enormous energy and water consumption of such facilities.</p>

          <p>A new report commissioned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews has found a "specific unaddressed issue of antisemitism" within the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The report, which took evidence from various sectors, made several recommendations, including that the NHS hold a summit to tackle the problem and include antisemitism in all diversity training. It also calls for a standardized qualification for antisemitism trainers and for Judaism to be recognized as both an ethnicity and a religion to ensure proper handling of discrimination. The findings highlight a surge in antisemitism and a failure to apply equal protections to Jewish people.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing a rare jury trial to determine its responsibility in the 2019 death of a woman who was struck by a Model S operating on its Autopilot feature. The woman was stargazing in Florida when the car, allegedly traveling at nearly 70 mph, collided with her. Lawyers for the victim's family argue that the driver assistance system failed to warn the driver or brake, making Tesla partially liable. Tesla contends the driver was solely to blame as he was distracted by a dropped cell phone. The trial is significant as most past cases against the company have been dismissed or settled out of court.</p>

          <p>According to analysts, the United States is unlikely to succeed in pressuring its key allies, Japan and Australia, to make public commitments on their potential actions in a conflict over Taiwan. The effort is seen as part of a U.S. strategy to amplify the "China threat" and encourage allies to increase their defense spending and military cooperation. However, both mainland Chinese and U.S. analysts suggest that such public pledges are improbable. They interpret Washington's push as a sign of weakening confidence in its own ability to manage the escalating regional tensions with Beijing without more explicit support from its partners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, ending a long-standing trade agreement. The Commerce Department stated the move is designed to protect American farmers from what it calls unfair trade practices and cheap imports that have undercut domestic producers. While supporters, particularly in Florida's tomato industry, have praised the decision as a victory, critics warn it could lead to higher prices for consumers and harm U.S. businesses that rely on the imports. The move comes amid a broader push by the administration to use tariffs as a tool in its trade policy.</p>

          <p>New research from Tel Aviv University has provided the first evidence that animals respond to sounds produced by plants, potentially opening up a new field of ecological study. Scientists found that female moths avoided laying eggs on tomato plants that were making ultrasonic "screaming" noises associated with distress, such as dehydration. These sounds, which are outside the range of human hearing, are perceptible to many insects and some mammals. The discovery suggests that an entire invisible ecosystem of sound-based communication may exist, influencing behaviors like pollination, feeding, and seeking shelter among various species.</p>

          <p>A joint report from the WHO and UNICEF has revealed that more than 14 million children worldwide received no vaccinations at all in 2024. The report highlights a worrying trend, with childhood vaccination rates stagnating or declining in regions like Europe, leading to a surge in preventable diseases such as measles and whooping cough. Officials attribute the widening coverage gaps to the spread of misinformation and significant cuts in international aid.

The decision comes despite assurances from the Secretary of State that food aid would not be wasted.

They argue that provisions designed to make it cheaper for leaseholders to extend their leases or buy their freeholds violate their human rights to enjoy private property. The claimants contend the changes could cost them hundreds of millions and leave them without adequate compensation. Leaseholder campaign groups, who are not represented in court, fear the legal battle will stall much-needed reforms for years, trapping them in unfair property arrangements.</p>
