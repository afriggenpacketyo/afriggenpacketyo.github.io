          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan to cut jobs and reorganize numerous federal agencies. Judge Susan Ilston stated that the executive branch cannot disregard Congress's mandates regarding federal agencies' creation, funding, and duties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit filed by unions and advocacy groups challenging President Trump's executive order aimed at transforming the federal bureaucracy. The Trump administration has requested an emergency pause from the Supreme Court, arguing the injunction impedes executive branch operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his recommendation for a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union starting June 1, citing ongoing trade negotiation difficulties. Simultaneously, he threatened Apple with a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, pushing for domestic production. These announcements immediately impacted financial markets, causing U.S. stock futures and European stock markets to decline. Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested the tariffs aim to expedite trade discussions with the EU, however, analysts remain skeptical about the long-term implementation due to potential harm to the U.S. economy.</p>

The 50-foot-long vessel, identified as an American-built gunboat from the 1770s, was initially used during the Revolutionary War before being repurposed as landfill in the 1790s. Over the past 14 years, experts have worked to preserve and gather information about the ship with help from Texas A&M University historical preservationists.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances reveals that clownfish exposed to a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea shrank in size. Researchers measured 134 clownfish monthly over six months and found that most of the fish got shorter, possibly as an adaptation to survive hotter temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, suggesting that downsizing may help clownfish cope with heat stress. This study adds complexity to understanding how marine life adapts to climate change, particularly in the face of devastating coral reef damage.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to address costs associated with plant closures and restructuring. The automaker may also book an additional 60 billion yen in restructuring expenses this fiscal year as it continues its turnaround strategy.

The company is seeking to streamline operations and return to profitability amid declining sales and U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an operation to terminate immigration court cases for certain migrants, allowing ICE to arrest and place them in expedited removal proceedings. This process enables quicker deportations without a court hearing for those who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for over two years. Immigration lawyers report arrests outside courthouses, advising clients to attend hearings despite the risks. Critics argue this strategy circumvents due process, while DHS maintains it enforces existing laws and faults the prior administration for not deporting migrants quickly enough.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt and negatively impact the lowest-income Americans.

          <p>President Trump announced via social media that Apple will face a tariff of 25% or more on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. Shares of Apple subsequently fell about 2% following the post. Trump's statement comes as Apple has been shifting some of its iPhone production to India, in part to avoid tariffs on products made in China. Analysts estimate that producing iPhones in the U.S. could increase the price of the device by at least 25%, with some estimating the cost could reach as high as $3,500 per device.</p>

          <p>Recent observations of exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years from Earth, initially suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a molecule potentially indicative of life. However, three independent analyses of the data have refuted these claims, finding no compelling evidence for life on K2-18b. While the combined data showed strong signals of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane, there was no clear evidence of dimethyl sulfide. These conflicting interpretations underscore the challenges of observing distant planets and interpreting faint signals from their atmospheres.</p>

          <p>A bill passed by House Republicans aims to repeal subsidies that support electric vehicles (EVs), which would impact the growth of the technology.

Republican leaders argue the subsidies benefit affluent car buyers, while Democrats say the changes would increase emissions and hurt low-income populations.
