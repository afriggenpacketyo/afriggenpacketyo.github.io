          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform Max back to HBO Max, reversing a decision made two years prior. The company aims to emphasize quality over quantity in its programming, focusing on distinct and great content for adults and families. This move comes as WBD seeks to scale back its content volume and focus on quality programming, mirroring a similar strategy shift by competitor Disney. CEO David Zaslav stated that the rebranding aims to leverage the HBO brand, representing the highest quality in media, to further accelerate growth, as the streaming business has turned around its profitability by almost $3 billion in the last two years and scaled globally with around 22 million subscribers added in the last year.</p>

          <p>Three Yale professors, Marci Shore, Timothy Snyder, and Jason Stanley, are moving to the University of Toronto due to concerns about the regression of American democracy. These experts in authoritarianism highlight attacks on civil liberties, the rule of law, and the courts as reasons for their departure. Professor Stanley is protesting the Trump administration's attacks on civil liberties, while Professor Shore cites the sharp regression of American democracy. Professor Snyder is primarily leaving to support his wife and children, but shares concerns about the difficulty of having conversations about freedom in the U.S. This article emphasizes the professors' shared analysis that ignoring attacks on democratic institutions spells trouble for the country's future.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a House committee, defending the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to HHS. Kennedy stated his goal is to focus on chronic disease and improve services while cutting costs to taxpayers, and that the new budget addresses mental health, addiction, nutrition, food safety, cybersecurity, and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion funding. Democratic representatives criticized the cuts, asserting they would harm life-saving work and result in deaths. Kennedy also faced questions about his views on vaccines, declining to say if he would vaccinate his own children, and rebuked criticism of the agency's response to the measles outbreak.</p>

          <p>Israel attempted to assassinate Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas military commander in Gaza, but the long-term impact of his potential death remains uncertain. While his death would be a tactical success for Israel, Hamas has proven resilient despite past assassinations of its leaders. Analysts suggest that even if confirmed, Sinwar's death might not significantly alter Hamas's strategic outlook or soften Israel's approach to cease-fire negotiations. The article highlights that Hamas's survival does not depend on a single individual and that Israel's broader goals of achieving "total victory" over Hamas extend beyond targeting specific commanders.</p>

          <p>Exceptionally low river levels in the UK raise concerns about water supplies for households, farmers, and businesses, with the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology warning that conditions could worsen in the next three months. The warning follows the driest spring in England since 1961, and the Environment Agency has indicated a medium risk of drought, cautioning households about potential water restrictions. Some farmers are already irrigating crops earlier than usual, leading to concerns about food production and increased imports.

          <h2>Most Americans Can't Afford Basic Costs of Living, Analysis Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and what they need to achieve a basic standard of living is growing. The analysis looks beyond daily necessities to consider technology tools, higher education, and health care costs. For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach, with these households needing to make $67,000 annually to afford basic items, while earning an average of $38,000. The cost of affording a basic level of economic security has doubled since 2001, with housing and health care costs surging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roki Sasaki, a highly anticipated rookie pitcher for the Dodgers, has been placed on the 15-day injured list due to a shoulder issue. Manager Dave Roberts stated that Sasaki's underperformance in his major league starts was due to the shoulder pain, which he kept secret. The explanation raises concerns about a potential chronic problem, as Sasaki has a history of shoulder issues. The article questions whether Sasaki's struggles are due to a chronic injury or a lack of readiness for the major leagues, either of which would be problematic for the Dodgers.</p>

Authorities are treating the men as foreign agents directed by Russian state actors. The arrests come after warnings that Germany has become a target of Russian hybrid attacks.</p>

          <p>As the world awaits potential cease-fire negotiations, Russia is sending a message that it is winning in Ukraine and should get what it wants. President Putin and his officials have been making hardball demands, insisting Ukraine accept strict limitations on its military and cede territory. The Trump administration finds these demands unrealistic, given the costly and incremental nature of Russia's gains. Any success in the talks will depend on convincing Putin that he stands to benefit more from warm ties with the United States than from costly gains on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, who have spent over three decades in prison for murdering their parents, are one step closer to potential freedom after being resentenced. Their sentences were reduced from life without parole to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The brothers maintained that the killings were in self-defense, alleging sexual abuse by their father. A Netflix documentary and docudrama brought renewed attention to the case, and there is new evidence bolstering their sexual assault claims. The brothers' fate now rests with state parole officials and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p>
