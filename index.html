          <p>Chinese scientists have tested key components for quantum-based communication networks during a rocket flight, marking a step towards building a space-ground system for secure communications. The test involved a laser module and a phase encoding device on board a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket, which reached 2.5km during a vertical flight. The experiment assessed the modules' resilience to vibration and radiation during rocket ascent, a critical phase in developing quantum secure direct communication (QSDC). QSDC, proposed by Chinese physicists, sends messages directly through a quantum channel, skipping key-sharing and making the system efficient and secure.</p>

          <p>San Francisco has intensified its efforts to address the homeless crisis, conducting targeted sweeps of encampments. Between June 2024 and June 2025, nearly 1,000 people were arrested or cited for illegal camping, although few face charges. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city leads with services, focusing on shelter, mental health, and drug treatment, while maintaining a tough-on-crime stance. Visible results include an increase in sheltered homeless individuals, rising from 35% in 2019 to nearly half of the 8,000 homeless in the city.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that in many states, young offenders are denied credit for 'dead time' spent in juvenile detention before adjudication. Unlike the adult system, this time often doesn't count toward their ultimate sentence, extending their confinement. Policy experts argue this practice wastes resources and negatively impacts young people, who are essentially being warehoused without access to rehabilitative services. The juvenile justice system, theoretically focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment, ironically results in diminished constitutional protections for minors compared to adults.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is challenging President Trump's proclamation barring international students from enrolling, arguing it is illegal and seeks an immediate block pending litigation. The university claims the ban denies students their right to education and the university's right to teach them, asserting that Harvard is not Harvard without its international students. The White House alleges Harvard is a hotbed of anti-American sentiment, jeopardizing national security, but Harvard denies these claims. Harvard argues the proclamation violates federal law by failing to substantiate national security concerns and is retaliatory for refusing to accede to demands to control the school's governance.</p>

          <p>A preliminary NTSB report indicates that an American Airlines flight that caught fire after takeoff from Denver had several engine parts installed incorrectly, leading to fuel leaks. The report detailed a loose part inside the right engine, installed in the wrong direction, and fuel leaking from a fitting also incorrectly fastened. The crew noticed high engine vibration shortly after takeoff, and upon landing, passengers and crew observed fire and smoke in the cabin. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, 12 passengers and six crew members suffered only minor injuries.</p>

According to the attorney, there were no red flags before the girls disappeared, and the parenting agreement was working well until the tragic event. She emphasized that Decker was an 'active dad' who was always involved in his children's activities, and the ex-wife feels empathy for him despite the horrific crime. The attorney is now advocating for changes in mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

          <p>The bromance between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump has ended in a very public breakup, with disagreements over Trump's Republican mega-bill leading to personal attacks. Musk's claim that Trump appears in documents about convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. This marks the end of an alliance that saw Musk become a major Republican donor and a key member of Trump's inner circle. The feud escalated after Trump threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Musk's companies.</p>
