          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the Fed would have likely lowered interest rates by now if not for the Trump administration's tariff policies. The tariffs introduced significant uncertainty and upward pressure on inflation forecasts, causing the central bank to adopt a "wait-and-see" approach. Despite pressure from the White House, Powell emphasized that future decisions on rate cuts will be data-dependent, with no specific timeline set for adjustments. The Fed's current stance reflects a cautious strategy amid unpredictable global trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate conducted a marathon "vote-a-rama," setting a record for the most votes in a single session as they debated President Trump's major legislative package.

Despite the prolonged session and some cross-party votes on specific amendments, Republican leadership worked to maintain party unity to advance the bill.

The facility, located at a former airport, is expected to hold up to 5,000 people. The administration stated it is a low-cost way to detain and process individuals for deportation.</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not significantly increased consumer prices in the U.S., with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. The ongoing uncertainty and frequent changes in trade policy have also made businesses hesitant to immediately pass on costs. However, experts warn that these are short-term buffers and price increases could still materialize later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to NYU professor and author Suzy Welch, asking "What kind of person should not work at this company?" is a highly effective way for job candidates to uncover a company's true values. This disarming question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct inquiries about company culture, revealing potential misalignments in work-life balance or collaboration styles. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, ideally after an offer is made, to gauge the authentic work environment. The strategy helps candidates assess if a company is the right fit.</p>

          <p>A new report from a defense analytics firm warns that the U.S. is "not prepared" for a potential war with China due to its significant reliance on Chinese suppliers for critical defense programs. In 2024, Chinese firms constituted 9.3% of the top-tier contractors for the Pentagon across nine essential sectors, including aviation, maritime, and missile defense. The analysis concludes that U.S. supply chains are "incredibly brittle," with the missile defense sector showing the highest dependency.

          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis of the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill" concludes that it would shift resources from the poor to the rich. The report finds that the lowest-earning 20% of households would see their annual income decrease by about $700, while the top 20% would gain an average of $5,700. This disparity is primarily due to sharp cuts in social programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). These cuts are used to offset the costs of extending tax cuts that disproportionately favor wealthier Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review of Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" examines the growing genre of literary kink and its shift from a taboo subject to a more mainstream category. The article discusses how nonfiction works aim to demystify BDSM, while fiction like Newell's explores the complex psychology and emotional landscapes of sex work and kink with literary depth. Newell's novel, set in San Francisco's sex industry, is praised for its sensory detail and nuanced portrayal of a protagonist navigating identity and loneliness. It reflects a broader cultural trend of redefining and destigmatizing once-forbidden sexual behaviors.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club announced it is selling a portion of its holdings in Broadcom to lock in a substantial 220% profit. The move comes after the tech stock surged nearly 90% from its April lows, reaching new all-time highs. While remaining bullish on the company's long-term potential in artificial intelligence, the sale is a disciplined move to take profits and raise cash while the market is considered overbought. The trim reflects a strategy to avoid greed after a period of strong outperformance. (not investment advice)</p>
