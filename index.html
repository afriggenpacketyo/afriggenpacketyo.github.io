          <p>Following weeks of heightened tensions stemming from a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India conducted strikes against Pakistan, targeting sites associated with militant groups, resulting in casualties on both sides. Pakistan responded by claiming to have downed Indian aircraft, though the exact details remained unclear. The international community is urging both nations to exercise restraint to prevent further escalation, with concerns rising about the potential for a protracted conflict amid severe economic challenges in Pakistan. The article notes that the nature of the strikes and subsequent statements from both sides may offer an offramp to de-escalate the conflict.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, a prominent Harvard scholar known for his theory of "soft power" and influence on U.S.-Japan relations, has died at the age of 88. Nye's work emphasized nonmilitary strengths, such as cultural influence, in international relations, and he played a key role in shaping the U.S.-Japan alliance. Along with Richard Armitage, Nye led a bipartisan group that developed proposals to strengthen the bilateral relationship, focusing on integrated partnerships and command-and-control architecture.

          <p>The British film and TV industry is concerned about the potential impact of proposed tariffs by President Trump on films made in "foreign lands." After enduring pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, the industry worries that these duties could cause significant disruption, as nearly 90 percent of film and high-end TV production spending in Britain comes from abroad, mainly the United States. The British government is in active discussions with the U.S. administration regarding these tariffs, with many trade experts questioning how such measures could be effectively enforced given the increasingly international nature of film productions.</p>
