          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, stating that its independence to pursue social and political values has been eliminated under its parent company, Unilever. The decision follows a significant public dispute in which the ice cream brand attempted to halt sales in West Bank settlements, a move that conflicted with Unilever's corporate direction. Greenfield expressed profound disappointment that the core principle of independence, which was a condition of the sale to Unilever, is now gone.</p>

          <p>A former Pentagon official has described recent direct talks between U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his Chinese counterpart as signaling a "significant shift" in American policy toward Beijing. The official highlighted Hegseth's statement that the United States does not seek conflict, regime change, or the "strangulation" of China. This messaging is viewed as a crucial de-escalatory signal that the Chinese side must acknowledge to help stabilize relations.</p>

          <p>A new production of Jonathan Spector's play "Eureka Day" at the Pasadena Playhouse is being praised for its timely and explosive satire of vaccine mandate debates. The comedy, written before the COVID-19 pandemic, is set at a fictional, progressive private elementary school in Berkeley where a mumps outbreak forces a confrontation between parental choice and community health. The play hilariously skewers the clash between anti-science sentiment and the school's overly accommodating "woke" culture.</p>
