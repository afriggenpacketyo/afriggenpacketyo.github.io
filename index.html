        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study on the Galleri blood test indicates it could significantly advance early cancer diagnosis by detecting fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. The trial, involving 25,000 adults in North America, successfully identified over 50 types of cancer, with more than half found at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently lack any routine screening programs, such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. While researchers are optimistic about its potential, further evidence from a large-scale NHS trial is needed to confirm if the test reduces cancer mortality rates.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of nationwide "No Kings" protests against former President Donald Trump and his policies, Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have activated their National Guard troops. Organizers expect demonstrations at over 2,500 locations, building on a previous event that drew millions of participants. The protests aim to challenge what organizers describe as Trump's "authoritarianism," while some of his allies have labeled the gatherings as "Hate America" rallies. The mobilization of troops has drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as an attempt to suppress peaceful dissent.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year prison sentence of ex-congressman George Santos, leading to his immediate release. Santos had served less than three months after being convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited what he called the "horrible" mistreatment of Santos in prison and praised his record of voting with the Republican party. The decision, which followed a public plea from Santos, has drawn sharp criticism from several New York Republicans and Democrats, who argue the short time served does not constitute justice for his crimes.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani produced one of the most dominant postseason performances in baseball history, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers and a 4-0 series sweep. Ohtani achieved a rare feat by hitting three home runs and recording 10 strikeouts as the starting pitcher in the same game, a post-season record. His heroics, which included a 469-foot home run, secured the National League Championship Series MVP award for him.

          <p>The Israeli military has identified remains returned from Gaza as those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage who was killed during the October 7th attack. His body was subsequently taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz into Gaza. This confirmation comes amid ongoing tensions regarding the terms of a recent ceasefire deal, under which Hamas was expected to return all deceased hostages. While Hamas claims it remains committed to the agreement, it has cited difficulties in locating bodies due to destruction from Israeli strikes. Margalit is the tenth deceased hostage whose remains have been repatriated from the territory.</p>

The technology addresses a major inefficiency in cloud services, where many GPUs are allocated to AI models that are used only sporadically, leading to wasted resources.

Tensions escalated when officers moved to clear a roadway, leading to physical altercations and detentions. The protest was one of several recent demonstrations at the facility, which have been met with a strong law enforcement presence and previous use of chemical irritants. The clash occurred just one day after a court ordered federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations following complaints about their conduct.</p>

          <p>The popular Chinese television drama "Silent Honour" has inspired a wave of public appreciation for the country's historical intelligence agents. Following the show's success, there has been a notable increase in visitors to a memorial square in Beijing to pay respects at the tomb of Wu Shi, a real-life agent. Wu was a high-ranking Kuomintang general who secretly worked for the Communist Party while stationed in Taiwan in 1949. Visitors have been leaving flowers and thank-you notes, honoring him as an "unsung hero" and reflecting the drama's powerful impact on contemporary perceptions of national history.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Diplomatic Approach to Ukraine War Faces Scrutiny After Zelensky Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 21:29:56 EDT</div>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump's strategy for the Ukraine war is under review following a White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Trump deferred a decision on supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles. The meeting was preceded by a surprise phone call from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who proposed another summit and trade deals, seemingly influencing Trump to delay the weapons transfer. This contrasts with Trump's recent approach in the Middle East, where he applied significant pressure to broker a ceasefire in Gaza. Critics suggest that without similar leverage applied to Russia, progress toward peace in Ukraine remains unlikely.</p>
