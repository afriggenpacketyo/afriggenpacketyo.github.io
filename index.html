          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is under investigation by Parliament's standards watchdog for not declaring free theatre tickets in a timely manner. While Reeves declared the trip on her ministerial register, she failed to update the MPs register of interests within the required 28 days, violating the parliamentary code of conduct. A spokesperson for Reeves stated that her interests are fully declared and up to date, but the investigation continues to assess the breach of protocol regarding the late declaration. This incident highlights the importance of adhering to transparency regulations for members of Parliament.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Trump attributed the recent GDP contraction to his predecessor's policies and defended his sweeping tariffs, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. The Commerce Department reported a 0.3% annualized GDP decrease, the first since Q1 2022, which Trump immediately blamed on Biden's "overhang." However, the report indicates that the GDP decline was influenced by companies importing goods to preempt Trump's tariffs and cuts in government defense spending. Experts also link declining payroll numbers and consumer confidence to uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff policies, creating a complex economic picture.</p>

          <p>Etsy shares experienced a significant drop after reporting mixed first-quarter results, with earnings per share falling short of expectations despite revenue exceeding projections.

The stock decline coincided with broader market fears of a recession driven by President Trump's tariff policies. Etsy CEO Josh Silverman noted that the company is staying nimble amidst the tariff uncertainty, although the company is vastly less dependent on products from China.</p>

CEO Peter Arduini stated that GE HealthCare is actively driving mitigation actions in response to the global trade environment. Despite the tariff concerns, the company noted strong customer demand in many markets and plans to invest in future innovation.</p>
