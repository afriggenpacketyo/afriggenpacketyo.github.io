          <p>Spotify's stock experienced its most significant single-day drop in over a year after the company's second-quarter financial results and future guidance disappointed investors. The music streaming service reported a net loss and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, citing increased operational costs. For the upcoming quarter, Spotify projected revenues lower than analysts' forecasts, attributing part of the weakness to foreign exchange headwinds, which overshadowed its steady growth in monthly active users and premium subscribers.

          <p>High-level trade negotiations between the United States and China in Stockholm have concluded without an agreement to extend a temporary pause on tariffs. U.S. officials stated that any extension of the truce, which is set to expire on August 12, requires final approval from President Donald Trump. If the deadline passes without a deal, tariffs could revert to their higher April levels. Despite the lack of a breakthrough, both sides described the discussions as constructive and agreed to continue dialogue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had "stole" Virginia Giuffre from the spa at his Mar-a-Lago club in the early 2000s. Trump stated this was one of multiple instances where Epstein poached employees from his property, which he cited as the reason for ending their friendship. These comments come amid ongoing legal and political fallout from the Epstein case, including Trump's defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a separate Epstein-related story.</p>

          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition alleges that American labor activist Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. Smalls, a co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union, was aboard an aid ship attempting to breach the Gaza blockade when it was intercepted by the IDF. According to the coalition, Smalls was choked and kicked by uniformed individuals after being taken into custody. The group is condemning the alleged violence and demanding accountability for what it describes as discriminatory treatment.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," a critical scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action aimed at reducing costs for consumers and industry by repealing emissions standards for vehicles and other sources. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have condemned the decision, arguing it ignores overwhelming climate science and constitutes a dereliction of the agency's duty to protect public health.</p>
