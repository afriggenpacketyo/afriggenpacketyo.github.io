          <p>SpaceX is preparing for its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from the Texas Gulf Coast, aiming to evaluate numerous upgrades after three consecutive in-flight failures. This crucial mission involves deliberately stressing the vehicle and testing unique engine configurations, including intentionally disabling one landing engine for data collection. The Starship will deploy simulator satellites and attempt an in-space engine restart, while the Super Heavy booster is slated for a controlled splashdown. Success is vital for SpaceX's Starlink and Mars ambitions, as well as NASA's Artemis lunar landing program, which relies on Starship for astronaut transport and complex in-space refueling operations.</p>

          <p>Psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, a renowned trauma research pioneer, ignited controversy by comparing Israelis to "Nazis" and disparaging Orthodox Jewish patients during a workshop. The Omega Institute apologized for his "inappropriate and antisemitic comments," but van der Kolk later threatened to sue for libel, denying the antisemitism claim. This incident highlights a concerning trend of antisemitism within the mental health community, where Jewish trauma is increasingly devalued or mischaracterized. The article argues that ideological frameworks are compromising ethical standards and the healing process.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has denied he will quit, but cannot guarantee his future beyond the transfer window due to a strained relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Nuno expressed frustration over the club's transfer activity, despite the team signing eight senior players and performing well in their recent match. Discussions with Marinakis and global head of football Edu are planned to address transfer needs, particularly for a new goalkeeper and two full-backs. The uncertainty has reportedly spread to the playing squad, though fans remain supportive of Nuno.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's presence is expected to be inescapable at the 2026 World Cup in the US, following his repeated public appearances with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. Trump announced the World Cup draw will take place at Washington DC's Kennedy Center, a venue he now controls and has renamed. Infantino's deferential behavior, including allowing Trump to hold the World Cup trophy and endorsing his DC crackdown, suggests FIFA is eager to maintain favor with the president. Critics warn that Trump's political agenda will overshadow the tournament's spirit, turning it into his personal plaything.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in northern Napa County has grown to over 6,800 acres with only 11% containment, fueled by hot and dry conditions. The blaze, which started northeast of Calistoga, has prompted evacuation orders for residents and threatens homes and vineyards in the region. Despite challenging weather, fire crews have successfully held the fire within established control lines on its eastern edge. Over 1,200 personnel are battling the fire with extensive equipment, as California faces elevated fire weather conditions and multiple other wildfires across the state.</p>

          <p>Millions across the Western US, including parts of California, Oregon, and Washington, are enduring a dangerous heatwave with temperatures soaring above 100 degrees, intensifying wildfire risks. The National Weather Service warns of extreme heat through Tuesday, with little nighttime relief, increasing the threat of heat illness. Officials urge residents to stay hydrated, seek air-conditioned spaces, and check on vulnerable individuals. The severe conditions are exacerbating ongoing wildfires, such as the 6,800-acre Pickett Fire in Napa County and the 18,000-acre Flat Fire in central Oregon, complicating containment efforts for firefighters.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western European leaders of not wanting peace in Ukraine, while praising Donald Trump's efforts to end the conflict. Vice-President JD Vance acknowledged Russian concessions, including recognizing Ukraine's territorial integrity and security guarantees, but noted the war isn't over. Lavrov stated no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned without a prepared agenda, a stance echoed by Zelenskyy who believes Russia doesn't genuinely seek to end the war. This diplomatic stalemate persists despite Trump's public frustrations and threats of sanctions.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans a major overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to cut delays and reduce the number of migrants housed in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators, intended to process appeals more swiftly than current courts. While initial asylum decisions have accelerated, 51,000 appeals currently await a ruling, taking over a year on average. The Refugee Council, however, argues that reducing mistakes in initial decisions is the fastest way to alleviate the appeals backlog, as nearly half of overturned decisions were initially flawed.</p>

Trump, who federalized DC's police and deployed the Guard there, responded on Truth Social by attacking Moore's record and reiterating his offer to send troops.

This contrasts sharply with only 5% living the "dream." The financial stress stems from insufficient savings, with the average 401(k) balance for those 70 and up at just $250,000, far below the $1.26 million perceived as comfortable.

          <p>Emma Raducanu achieved a significant milestone by winning her first US Open match since her 2021 championship, defeating Japanese qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 in just 62 minutes. This victory marks a mental hurdle overcome for the British number one, who has shown improved form and confidence this year under her new Spanish coach, Francisco Roig. After painful first-round exits in previous years, Raducanu's solid performance against a lower-ranked opponent signals her steady rise in the rankings and renewed vigor at Flushing Meadows.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old New York Democratic mayoral candidate, is facing skepticism over his ambitious campaign promises, which include tax hikes on the wealthy, free buses, free childcare, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. Critics suggest that many of these proposals, while appealing, have little realistic chance of becoming tangible policies. The article highlights a common political dynamic where candidates make grand pledges that may be difficult to implement given the constraints of their office.</p>

          <p>Internal Jesuit correspondence from the 1970s and 80s reveals that numerous officials were aware of Donald B Dickerson's history of sexually assaulting children but allowed him to be ordained as a priest. Despite warnings and psychological reports detailing his manipulative behavior and a "psychosexual problem," Dickerson continued to abuse minors at various institutions. These revelations, stemming from a pending lawsuit, raise serious questions about accountability within the church and the ongoing canonization cause for former superior general Pedro Arrupe, who was aware of the concerns but did not stop the ordination.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new legislation allowing courts to impose pub and travel bans as part of community sentences, aiming to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding. These reforms, inspired by a review from former Justice Secretary David Gauke, also include restricting short prison sentences and a scheme for early release of well-behaved inmates. The Ministry of Justice intends to expand the range of offenses for which such bans can be applied, and enhance probation conditions with more mandatory drug testing. Critics, however, voice concerns about implementation, funding, and the burden on hospitality venues and probation services.</p>

The freed individuals were believed to be part of a group abducted during a recent assault on a mosque in Unguwan Mantau that claimed 50 lives.
