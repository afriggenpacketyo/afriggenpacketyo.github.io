        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has definitively denied the Department of Justice's request to unseal grand jury materials from Jeffrey Epstein's criminal case, marking the third and final rejection of the Trump administration's efforts. Judge Richard Berman criticized the DOJ for focusing on a mere 70 pages of grand jury transcripts, primarily hearsay, when it possesses over 100,000 pages of Epstein-related files, suggesting the motion was a "diversion." The judge also emphasized the administration's failure to adequately notify victims and warned of potential threats to their safety and privacy if the records were released. This ruling effectively ends the public release of these specific grand jury documents, though other Epstein files are expected to be shared with Congress soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to a 10-month low, many prospective homebuyers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, remain on the sidelines due to persistently high home prices and a significant undersupply in the market. In New York City, for instance, median listing prices exceed $829,000, making entry difficult for first-time buyers whose average age is now 38. Uncertainty about future rate movements also contributes to hesitation, with many waiting for further price and interest rate declines. This situation has led to the lowest share of first-time buyers on record, highlighting a complex affordability crisis in the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives has reconvened to advance a controversial Republican-backed redistricting plan, designed to significantly improve GOP political performance by potentially adding up to five congressional seats. This move follows a two-week quorum break by Democrats protesting the bill, who have since returned. Democrats, like State Rep. Chris Turner, argue the legislation is illegal and racially discriminatory, a claim Republicans refute by citing Supreme Court rulings on partisan gerrymanders. The bill is expected to pass the House swiftly, despite ongoing protests and a separate legal challenge regarding police escorts for lawmakers.</p>

          <p>A high-profile South African animal breeder, John Hume, 83, and five others have been detained on charges of operating an illegal rhino horn smuggling network valued at $14.1 million. Hume, who once owned one of the world's largest rhino herds, is accused of exporting over 900 horns using false domestic permits, despite international bans on overseas sales. This complex investigation, which began in 2017, underscores South Africa's commitment to protecting its natural heritage against poaching. The case highlights the ongoing demand for rhino horns in illegal markets, sought as status symbols and for their unproven aphrodisiac properties.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting show officials were divided on economic risks, with most agreeing it was too soon to lower interest rates despite concerns about the labor market and inflation. Two governors voted against holding rates steady, advocating for cuts. Policymakers debated the uncertain effects of President Trump's tariffs on inflation and acknowledged a weakening in labor market conditions, even before later-reported weaker payroll growth figures. The summary highlights potential difficult tradeoffs if high inflation persists while employment declines, setting the stage for Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming address on policy direction.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has issued cease-and-desist letters to two organizations and a doctor, threatening lawsuits for allegedly mailing or facilitating abortion pills to Texans, asserting the actions are unlawful. This escalation follows the state's near-total ban on abortions and the surge in abortion pill availability since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Despite the threats, one organization, Her Safe Harbor, vowed to continue its services, reporting a significant increase in requests from fearful Texans. Paxton's actions repeatedly cite the Comstock Act of 1873, an old anti-vice law, signaling an intensified campaign against abortion pill providers.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man, Jason King, has been sentenced to nine years in jail for shooting a police officer with a crossbow during a neighbor dispute near High Wycombe, UK.

The judge noted King's actions were an attempt to "settle a score with police" and posed a "significant" risk, commending the bravery of the officers involved. King, who bought the crossbow online for under £20, pleaded guilty to multiple charges including unlawful wounding and wounding with intent.</p>

However, others, including psychologist Natasha Tiwari, suggest that rewarding effort rather than just grades is a more sustainable strategy, warning that large financial treats can make achievements seem "transactional."

          <p>Ernesto Barajas, a popular Mexican musician from the group Enigma Norteno, known for his "narco-corridos" celebrating drug cartel exploits, was shot dead in a Zapopan parking lot. This incident marks another death among performers of this controversial music genre, with two men on a motorcycle opening fire on him. Enigma Norteno's songs include tributes to notorious figures like "El Mencho" of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and "Los Chapitos." The U.S. government has recently revoked visas for artists linked to the genre, reflecting efforts to curb the glorification of criminal groups amidst ongoing violence.</p>

          <p>Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has declared that Moscow will only agree to security guarantees for Ukraine if it retains veto power over them, dismissing any non-consultative efforts as a "road to nowhere." Lavrov cited the 2022 Istanbul framework as a potential blueprint, which Ukraine previously rejected due to its provision for Russian veto power. This demand comes amidst accelerated diplomatic efforts for peace, with European leaders considering troop deployments and the U.S. hinting at air support. Russia also accused European leaders of attempting to manipulate President Trump into aligning with their "aggressive" stance on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Oregon are in a desperate race to save the Doerner Fir, one of the world's tallest and oldest trees, from a persistent fire that has been burning since Saturday. The giant fir, over 325 feet tall and estimated at 450 years old, has already lost approximately 50 feet from its top due to the blaze, potentially impacting its global height ranking. Despite hot and dry weather forecasts, efforts continue, including helicopter water drops and ground containment lines. Officials have even considered unconventional methods like scaffolding to reach high flames, though they believe the tree's massive size prevents it from burning completely.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had previously stated the U.S. government would require an equity stake for such funds, which Intel views as dilutive.

          <p>State and local governments are bracing for less federal disaster relief aid as the Trump administration reshapes FEMA, with President Trump indicating a shift towards less, more direct funding from his office. Critics, including the Government Accountability Office, argue FEMA has been slow to pay out and coordinate recovery programs, with over 600 open disaster declarations, some dating back decades. This policy change could place a heavier financial burden on states, as exemplified by North Carolina's Hurricane Helene recovery, where federal funds covered only a fraction of the $59.6 billion in damages. FEMA maintains its principle of federally supported, state-managed, and locally executed disaster response.</p>
