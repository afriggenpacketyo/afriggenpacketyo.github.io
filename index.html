The annual online tournament, where the public votes for their favorite bear bulking up for hibernation, will feature past champions and new contenders. Park officials note that the abundance of food has led to less conflict and more playful behavior among the bears, providing a more harmonious backdrop for the celebrated event.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered Google to share parts of its search index and user click-and-query data with competitors as a penalty for monopolizing the search market. While intended to foster competition, this ruling has sparked significant privacy concerns among tech analysts, who warn it could expose sensitive, personally identifiable information. A new technical oversight committee will be established to determine which companies qualify for access and to create security measures, but experts worry about balancing competitive goals with user data protection.</p>

          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban government has ordered the removal of all books authored by women from the country's university teaching system. This is part of a wider decree that also bans 18 academic subjects, including human rights and gender studies, deeming them contradictory to Sharia law and Taliban policy. The move is the latest in a series of severe restrictions imposed on women and girls, who are already barred from most forms of education, further suppressing female voices, ideas, and perspectives from public and academic life.</p>

          <p>Human remains believed to belong to Travis Decker, a former soldier wanted for the murder of his three young daughters, have been found in a remote wooded area in Washington state. Decker had been the subject of a massive manhunt since early June, when the bodies of his daughters were discovered at a campsite. The girls, aged 5, 8, and 9, had been bound and died of asphyxiation. Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to formally confirm the identity of the discovered remains.</p>

          <p>For the sixth time, the United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council draft resolution that called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages. The U.S. envoy argued the text did not adequately condemn Hamas or acknowledge Israel's right to self-defense. All 14 other council members voted in favor of the resolution, highlighting the increasing diplomatic isolation of the U.S. and Israel on the issue as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen.</p>

          <p>The discovery of the largest fisher ever recorded in Ohio, found as roadkill, marks a significant milestone in the mammal's return to the state after a 200-year absence. The species, part of the weasel family, had disappeared from the region due to deforestation and unregulated trapping in the 1800s. Experts believe the resurgence of fishers, along with other wildlife like bald eagles and river otters, is a positive indicator of an improving and expanding ecosystem in the state.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed a large-scale black market for Premier League tickets operated by overseas companies, making it difficult for genuine fans to purchase tickets at face value. These companies are believed to use computer software and bulk memberships to acquire thousands of tickets, which are then resold illegally at prices two to four times their original cost. The practice raises concerns about fan access and safety, as it can undermine strict segregation rules designed to keep rival supporters apart.</p>
