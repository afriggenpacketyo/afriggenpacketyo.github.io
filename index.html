          <p>The UK's Labour government executed a major U-turn on planned cuts to disability benefits following internal party rebellion. The initial plan aimed for short-term savings to meet self-imposed borrowing rules, but critics argued it was a cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine long-term reform to address rising health-related welfare claims. The reversal has raised questions about the government's ability to manage its agenda and whether its focus on fiscal targets is undermining more substantive, structural reforms.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that two of its research aircraft will be flying at low altitudes over the Los Angeles Basin, Salton Sea, and Central Valley. The flights are part of the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP), where students gather atmospheric data by performing maneuvers like vertical spirals and simulated missed landings. Officials are reassuring the public that the unusual flight patterns, occurring between 1,000 and 10,000 feet, are for scientific purposes and not a cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>In a passionate closing argument, Sean "Diddy" Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo urged the jury to acquit the music mogul, portraying the prosecution as a "fake trial." Agnifilo argued that the government exaggerated evidence of a "swingers lifestyle" to build false charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, admitting to domestic violence but insisting it was separate from the alleged criminal enterprise. The defense painted Combs' accusers as motivated by money and not credible, asking the jury to "summon that courage" to find Combs innocent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a significant expansion of presidential authority. The author contends that by curbing the power of lower courts to block illegal executive actions, the court has effectively given the president a green light to defy the Constitution, with citizens having to seek relief on a case-by-case basis. The ruling is described as an "existential threat to the rule of law" that creates a chaotic patchwork of rights across the country.</p>

          <p>This article posits a potential resurgence of the Tea Party movement's ideas within the Republican party, driven by opposition to President Trump's spending plans. Original Tea Party-era figures like Senator Rand Paul are once again advocating for fiscal discipline and spending cuts, clashing with the current GOP leadership over a major tax bill. This emerging rift mirrors the internal party conflicts of the early 2010s, though this time the dissenters are challenging a popular Republican president from their own party.</p>
