          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a key Belarusian opposition figure, was unexpectedly released after five years in prison and reunited with his family in Lithuania. Tsikhanouski, who had been held in solitary confinement and subjected to harsh conditions, credited Donald Trump with aiding his release, stating that Belarusian authorities are seeking to improve relations with the West. Despite his deteriorated health, Tsikhanouski expressed his determination to continue fighting against the Lukashenko regime and emphasized the need for unity within the opposition movement, while also blaming Vladimir Putin for supporting Lukashenko's government. He plans to undergo medical examinations and resume his political and blogging activities. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Detectives have renewed their appeal for information ten years after the murder of John "Goldfinger" Palmer, who was shot six times in his garden in 2015. Palmer, known for his alleged involvement in the 1983 Brink's-Mat robbery and timeshare fraud, was found to have been watched by a contract killer through a spyhole in his fence. Police believe the murder may be linked to Palmer's fraud trial, and they are hoping that shifting loyalties within the criminal underworld may encourage individuals to come forward with information. Despite previous arrests, no one has been charged in connection with the murder. The optimism score is 40.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) at the upcoming summit in The Hague, driven by pressure from the U.S. and ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The 5% target includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, though some members are hesitant to meet this goal. While some countries like the UK, Poland, and Germany have expressed intentions to increase spending, others like Spain and Italy are seen as major holdouts. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for long-term commitments to enable them to scale up production capacity. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while illegal on the streets, is being explored for its potential to make patients more receptive to psychotherapy, with some individuals reporting positive experiences. Concerns remain regarding the potential for misuse and side effects, but proponents hope that the treatment will become more widely available through the NHS. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Maureen Welch, the mother-in-law of chef Aldo Zilli, sustained life-altering injuries after being struck by a cyclist on a Lime e-bike who failed to stop at a red light. The Zilli family is now advocating for stricter regulation of e-bikes, citing a lack of rules and regulations that allow riders to speed, jump red lights, and use mobile phones. While the government is considering new offenses for dangerous cycling, responsibility for managing dockless e-bikes in London falls to local councils and the Department for Transport. Trauma surgeons are also witnessing a spike in injuries from e-bike accidents, leading to calls for better maintenance and regulation. The optimism score is 45.</p>

          <p>The article criticizes Western leaders for their feeble response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, arguing that their calls for diplomacy are undermined by their unwillingness to challenge the root causes of the conflict. The author argues that Western leaders are essentially passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom and failing to uphold international law and human rights. They are accused of prioritizing unconditional support for Israel over a coherent system of international law, and of displaying a hypocritical disregard for human life. The author concludes that these leaders are unrepresentative and unable to manufacture consent, contributing to a growing gap between politics and reality. The optimism score is 15.</p>

          <p>NATO's ambitious goals, including a proposed defense spending target of 5% of GDP, are placing heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide the necessary resources, the proposed spending level faces skepticism and criticism within the government and opposition. Experts argue that increased investment in the armed forces is crucial for Germany's national security, given the threat posed by Russia. In addition to financial commitments, NATO also requires additional troops, potentially necessitating the recruitment of tens of thousands of new soldiers, with discussions ongoing regarding the possible reinstatement of compulsory military service.

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, potentially giving Donald Trump a win while also rebalancing the alliance. NATO countries are expected to commit to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, with Secretary-General Mark Rutte advocating for 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for security-related investments. However, Spain is seeking an exemption, and Italy is requesting more time to meet the obligation, raising concerns about NATO's credibility.

Some papers highlight Iran's vow to retaliate and the risk of a wider conflict, while others focus on the impact on global security and the UK's response. The headlines reflect a range of concerns, from the potential for a drawn-out war to the threat of terror attacks on US allies. Amidst the international tensions, some papers also include domestic news, such as the UK's new industrial strategy and Reform UK's policy on non-doms. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of Marine Corps veteran Adrian Clouatre, was detained by ICE while still breastfeeding their 3-month-old baby. She had been seeking a green card to legally live and work in the U.S., but ICE had issued an order for her deportation in 2018 after her mother failed to appear at an immigration hearing. This case highlights the Trump administration's strict immigrant enforcement policies, which have reduced discretion for military families seeking legal status. Despite Marine Corps recruiters promoting enlistment as a means of protecting families lacking legal status, such protection is no longer guaranteed. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference.

The UN nuclear watchdog chief remains cautious in assessing the damage, and reports suggest some highly enriched uranium was moved before the strikes.
