          <p>Prince Harry is in the U.K. for charity engagements, marking the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death. His visit has fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his estranged father, King Charles III, and brother, Prince William, whom he has not seen in months. While a meeting with the King is considered a possibility to mend relations, experts believe a reunion with Prince William is highly unlikely due to their deeply strained relationship. Harry's last meeting with his father was a brief encounter in February following the King's cancer diagnosis.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a series of arrests in Chicago as part of "Operation Midway Blitz," targeting individuals with criminal records. During a ride-along, Fox News witnessed the arrest of a Mexican national who resisted, forcing agents to break his car window to apprehend him. The operation, which also led to the arrest of a convicted child sex offender, is named in honor of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old killed by an undocumented immigrant in a drunk-driving incident. The agency stated they will continue to pursue high-priority targets.</p>

          <p>Deodorant brand Mitchum has issued an apology after numerous customers reported severe skin irritation, including itching, burning, and rashes, from its 48-hour roll-on products. Consumers took to social media to share their experiences, with some describing the pain as feeling like their armpits were "on fire." The company stated that a change in the manufacturing process for a raw material, not a formula change, was the cause. Mitchum is now removing the affected batches from stores in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa and has reverted to its original manufacturing process.</p>

          <p>One year after Brian Niccol took over as CEO, Starbucks is undergoing significant changes to revive its brand and reverse declining sales, with mixed results so far. Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy focuses on improving the customer experience by reintroducing personal touches, enhancing store ambiance, and aiming for faster service. While some customers are returning, the company still faces shrinking traffic, and its stock has fallen 7% over the past year. The turnaround plan has also involved corporate layoffs, a stricter return-to-office policy, and ongoing tensions with the Starbucks Workers United union.</p>

          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard is celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles with a powerful painting of a bald eagle, a piece he started even before the team's last Super Bowl victory. The artwork, which features no players or stadiums, aims to embody the strength and pride of the team and the city. After losing his job as a chef, Richard returned to his passion for art, which he has pursued since childhood in Trinidad. He hopes the painting will be acquired by the Eagles' ownership or players, viewing it as a tribute to "Bird Nation."</p>

          <p>Following a recent controversy over a logo change, Cracker Barrel is now facing allegations from employees about declining food quality. Staff members claim the restaurant chain began cutting corners in its kitchens earlier this year, such as serving day-old biscuits and microwaving pre-cooked meatloaf to save time and money. These changes, reportedly implemented to boost efficiency amid staffing shortages, have led to customer complaints about "rock hard" biscuits and watery side dishes. The allegations suggest a broader shift in operations under CEO Julie Felss Masino that has prioritized efficiency over the chain's traditional homestyle freshness.</p>

This commentary analyzes Trump's statement, arguing that it aligns with archaic legal views that once considered violence within the home a private matter outside the law's reach. The article connects this perspective to the Trump administration's broader actions, such as cutting funding for domestic violence services.

          <p>China is advancing its "Air Silk Road" initiative, a plan to help dozens of partner countries develop their civil aviation infrastructure as part of the broader Belt and Road Initiative. A recent government report outlines goals to enhance air route connectivity, establish express air traffic corridors, and promote China's domestically produced aircraft, such as the Comac C919. This strategy aims to strengthen trade and logistical ties with nations primarily in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Eastern Europe. The initiative is seen as a way for China to expand its global influence in the aviation sector.</p>

          <h2>The Rise of Debit Cards Reflects a Cultural Shift Towards Debt Aversion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 11:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans, particularly younger generations like Gen Z, are increasingly favoring debit cards over credit cards, signaling a cultural shift driven by a fear of accumulating debt. While credit cards once dominated transactions, debit usage has steadily climbed, fueled by a desire for greater financial control and influenced by events like the Great Recession. This trend has prompted financial companies, including Venmo and Klarna, to launch new debit cards with rewards programs to attract these consumers. The preference for debit reflects a conscious effort by many to live within their means.</p>

          <p>The public release of a 238-page scrapbook made for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday has renewed focus on his network of powerful associates. The book, released by House Democrats, contains a sexually suggestive note and drawing allegedly signed by Donald Trump, which the president has denied creating. It also includes a second, previously unknown reference to Trump involving a large check and a comment about Epstein's "early talents with money + women." The scrapbook features glowing messages from numerous high-profile figures, suggesting Epstein's behavior was an open secret in his elite circles.</p>

          <p>According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, the German government failed to seize an additional 45,000 Bitcoin, now worth over $5 billion, linked to the defunct piracy website Movie2K. This stash is separate from the nearly 50,000 BTC that German authorities confiscated from the site's operators in early 2024. Arkham claims to have identified a new cluster of wallets belonging to Movie2K based on matching activity patterns and transaction origins with the previously seized funds. German authorities have not commented on the new findings, citing policy on ongoing investigations.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Case Over Trump's Tariffs Could Result in $1 Trillion in Government Refunds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 10:50:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing a high-stakes legal battle that could force the U.S. government to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs. After lower courts ruled that many of President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs" were illegally imposed, the administration has asked the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn those decisions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that refunding the tens of billions already collected, plus future projections, would be economically disruptive. The case centers on whether Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency economic powers to implement the widespread levies.</p>
