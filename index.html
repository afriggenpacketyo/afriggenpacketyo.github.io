          <p>Representative Nanette Diaz BarragÃ¡n is urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement multilingual Wireless Emergency Alerts for natural disasters, expressing concern over delays under the Trump administration. The delay jeopardizes the ability of non-English speakers to receive life-saving information, particularly in diverse areas like Los Angeles. The FCC was supposed to publish an order allowing multilingual alerts, but the Trump administration's regulatory freeze has stalled the process.

          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of protecting sharks. Pugh endured cold water and challenging weather conditions during the 12-day swim, which he described as one of the toughest in his career. He aims to change public perceptions of sharks, often portrayed negatively in media like the movie "Jaws," and highlight the need for their conservation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery has drawn criticism for including self-congratulatory remarks and partisan jabs. He spoke of his achievements, the upcoming Olympics and World Cup, and criticized unchecked migration. The speech also included tributes to fallen soldiers, though his remarks have been characterized as inappropriate for the solemn occasion.</p>

          <p>Kevin O'Leary, a celebrity investor and Harvard Business School professor, is pushing back against the Trump administration's plans to halt Harvard's ability to enroll international students. O'Leary argues that these students are vital for American innovation and economic growth, eager to build businesses in the U.S. He is urging President Trump and Harvard's president to reach an agreement, as the move leaves international students in limbo and could deter top global talent from attending U.S. universities.</p>

This shift comes amid increasing criticism from countries like Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada, and France regarding Israel's actions. While these countries still support Israel in many ways, the change in tone and some practical limitations on Israeli interests indicate a growing unease with Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach.</p>

          <p>An examination of early electric vehicles and their decline in the face of cheaper gasoline powered cars, this article draws parallels to today's market. Electric vehicles may be in trouble, at least in the United States, as Republican leaders are pushing legislation that would eliminate many Biden administration programs intended to promote electric vehicle sales, including a $7,500 federal tax credit. A restored 1909 Baker Electric in Jay Leno's collection, and a discussion about gender stereotypes and policy decisions from the past, offer a historical context for current challenges.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's delay of imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union, market watchers warn that the potential for trade tensions remains high. While the delay provides a window for negotiations, analysts express uncertainty about the Trump administration's goals and the EU's willingness to concede. The EU is likely to offer phased tariff cuts, but Trump's "America-first bravado" could lead to a tariff showdown that would hurt both economies. (not investment advice)</p>

The Dodgers are encouraging Scott to focus on getting more swings and misses, even if it means walking a few more batters, especially given injuries in the bullpen.</p>
