          <p>The Trump administration has ended the US tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800, impacting businesses and supply chains. This change, which officials say is permanent, introduces normal duty rates on all global parcel imports. A six-month transition allows postal service shippers to pay a flat duty based on the country of origin. The administration claims this will save lives by restricting narcotics and increase tariff revenues. The de minimis exemption had fostered small business growth on e-commerce platforms, but was also blamed for allowing unscreened packages and fentanyl to enter the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck Soo for allegedly abetting the short-lived martial law bid by ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol. Former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, Yoon's wife, faces corruption and bribery charges, including providing funds for a stock manipulation scheme and receiving luxury gifts. These indictments follow President Lee Jae Myung's approval of investigations into Yoon's martial law bid and allegations against his administration. The developments mark a significant shift in South Korean politics following Yoon's impeachment and removal from office earlier this year.</p>

          <p>UK firms are expressing concerns over new US taxes on low-value parcels, fearing uncertainty and potential price increases. President Trump's decision to end the "de minimis" exemption means parcels valued under $800 will be subject to tax. The Federation of Small Businesses warns this will raise costs and create barriers for small UK firms competing with larger brands. Some businesses have already halted shipments to the US due to uncertainty about costs and potential charges, significantly impacting their sales and market access. (not investment advice)</p>

The charges are part of a broader investigation into Yoon's martial law declaration last December. Prosecutors allege Kim violated the Political Funds Act, accepted bribes for mediation, and received polling data during the 2022 presidential elections. Kim's lawyers deny the charges, but she could face years in jail if convicted, marking the first time a South Korean first lady has been indicted.</p>

The biggest unfinished project is upgrading the city's sewage and stormwater system, requiring $111 million, but FEMA has denied the request twice. The mayor describes dealing with FEMA as "just ridiculous" and compares it to dealing with insurance agents who "delay, depose and deny."</p>
