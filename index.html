          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk is expected to draw over 100,000 mourners to State Farm Stadium in Arizona, prompting a top-level security designation from Homeland Security. President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to speak, called Kirk a "great man" with a "tremendous influence" on youth and stated the event should be a time of healing. Other high-profile speakers include Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, and members of Trump's cabinet. The large-scale event underscores Kirk's significant, and often controversial, role in American conservative politics.</p>

The White House has been negotiating a deal with China's ByteDance that would place the app's U.S. operations under American control, with a U.S.-majority board and Oracle managing data and privacy.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron condemned comments by U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner as an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." Kushner had publicly accused Macron's government of inaction against antisemitism and linked it to France's foreign policy on Israel. Macron firmly rejected the notion that criticizing the Israeli government is inherently antisemitic, emphasizing that such public rebukes from a diplomat violate diplomatic norms and are an improper use of taxpayer money. The dispute highlights growing international tensions over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a software provider owned by RTX, has caused major disruptions at several European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack disabled the 'Muse' check-in and baggage system, forcing airlines to resort to manual processing with pen and paper, which led to extensive delays and hundreds of flight cancellations. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as the company has not yet delivered a secure, functional version of the system, signaling that disruptions will continue.</p>

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland athletics team concluded the World Championships in Tokyo without a single gold medal, marking their worst performance at the event in 22 years. The team secured a total of five medals, their lowest count since 2005, and failed to win any relay medals for the first time since 2003. Officials cited a combination of missed opportunities, key athlete injuries, and challenging conditions, including extreme humidity, for the disappointing results. The performance stands in stark contrast to their success in recent championships.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asserted that the United States is facing "one of the most dangerous moments" in its history, accusing President Trump of weaponizing the federal government to punish political opponents. Murphy claimed that Trump is using the FCC and the Department of Justice to silence critics, drawing parallels to tactics used in authoritarian states like China and Iran. He specifically referenced the recent preemption of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' as an example of government coercion and called on Republicans to defend the fundamental American value of free speech.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, emphasizing the central bank's demonstrated independence and projections for two more cuts this year. He clarified that the Fed's action directly impacts overnight bank lending rates but does not automatically lower consumer borrowing costs for items like mortgages and auto loans. Cohn also pointed to recent data indicating a significant cooling in the U.S. labor market, as companies reduce their workforce to protect profit margins amid rising input costs.

          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can speed up the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress accelerates this decline, which can lead to health issues. Epel suggests that this damage is reversible through daily practices aimed at restoring cellular health. She recommends simple, sustainable lifestyle changes such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, and prioritizing deep rest to create an anti-inflammatory state and slow aging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on plastic flying rings at its beaches to prevent harm to seals. The decision follows a campaign highlighting the danger these toys pose, as curious young seals can get the rings stuck around their necks, leading to serious injury, infection, and death. This local ban is part of a broader movement, with other councils and major retailers like Tesco and Sainsbury's also taking action to remove the hazardous items from sale and use in coastal areas.</p>

          <h2>Study Identifies Nine Key Practices of Parents Raising Children with Strong Social Skills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 10:23:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 families, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children to handle minor conflicts on their own to build problem-solving skills. The foundation of strong social skills is not memorizing polite phrases but growing up in an environment where emotional safety, authentic connection, and resilience are consistently fostered through everyday interactions.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a new mutual defense pact, strengthening their long-standing security partnership at a time of growing regional uncertainty. Analysts suggest the agreement reflects a strategic move by Gulf Arab states to diversify their security alliances amid concerns about the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor. The pact indicates that Riyadh is seeking to "put its eggs in different baskets" by securing protection from Pakistan, a move that could also create new opportunities for Chinese arms sales in the region.</p>

          <p>As premium travel credit cards increase their annual fees, a credit expert advises consumers on how to maximize their value. Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, warns against three key mistakes: choosing no-fee cards that offer poor rewards, hoarding points that can be devalued by issuers, and failing to negotiate with the card company for retention offers before downgrading. He emphasizes that even a modest annual fee is often worthwhile for the superior perks and that users should regularly reassess if their card still aligns with their lifestyle and spending habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, and Australia, this analysis explores the significant practical challenges that remain. Key obstacles include the absence of defined territory, the deep political and geographical separation between the West Bank and Gaza, and the lack of a unified, functioning government. Palestinian politics has been stagnant for years, with no elections since 2006, creating a leadership vacuum that complicates any tangible steps toward establishing a viable and coherent state, even with newfound international support.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that will ban most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents from ICE, from wearing face masks. The legislation, which takes effect in 2026, was created in response to federal agents wearing masks during immigration raids in Los Angeles and aims to prevent the use of what Governor Gavin Newsom called "secret police." The law includes exceptions for specific situations like undercover operations or protection against disease, but federal officials have called the ban a "flagrant attempt to endanger our officers."</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing DNA from two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter have identified a previously unknown North African genetic lineage. The remains belong to female herders from the 'Green Sahara' period, when the region was more humid. Their genetic makeup was distinct from expected Sub-Saharan populations, showing a deep divergence that occurred around the same time modern humans migrated out of Africa. This finding suggests the group remained largely isolated, and that practices like pastoralism likely spread through cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration.</p>

Former England star Fara Williams, who played for Beard at Liverpool, described him as "more than a manager" and someone with "the purest of souls" who cared deeply about his players and the sport.

A Taliban spokesman emphasized that Afghanistan's territorial integrity is paramount and cited the Doha Agreement, in which the U.S. pledged not to threaten the country's sovereignty. Trump had recently claimed that discussions were underway to get the base back, asserting that the Taliban "need things from us," a claim the Taliban's firm denial appears to contradict.</p>

          <p>This historical analysis examines the parallels between the role of women in Nazi Germany and the rhetoric of contemporary right-wing movements in the United States. The article argues that authoritarian regimes often rely on women to uphold social stability by promoting traditional domestic duties—the "cradle and the ladle"—as essential to national strength. This ideology is now amplified by a digital "womanosphere" of influencers who glorify homemaking, which helps normalize a political agenda that rolls back women's rights and autonomy under the guise of celebrating family values.</p>
