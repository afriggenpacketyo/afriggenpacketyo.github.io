          <p>Kristen Saban, the daughter of legendary college football coach Nick Saban, has publicly refuted rumors that her father might be considering a return to coaching. Speculation arose after a former player mentioned a potential comeback and Kristen posted a nostalgic photo, which some fans interpreted as a hint. However, she clarified on social media that her father is not coming back, stating that his time in coaching is over. The article notes Saban's previous comments on the changing landscape of college sports, particularly regarding NIL deals, as a factor in his retirement decision.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that a majority of high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more annually, also struggle with credit card debt, often due to lifestyle inflation. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for these earners, who typically have good credit scores and access to higher credit limits. The options discussed include using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates and leveraging 0% APR balance transfer cards. Other methods involve negotiating directly with creditors for better rates or consulting a financial advisor for a personalized payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>CBS Cancels 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' Amid Financial Pressures and Political Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," with the program set to end when Colbert's contract expires in May 2026. While the network cited purely financial reasons, the decision comes amid speculation about political motivations, particularly concerning parent company Paramount Global's potential merger and perceived pressure from Donald Trump. The article contextualizes the cancellation within the broader decline of late-night political comedy, a genre Colbert helped pioneer. The move is seen by some as symbolic of a changing media landscape and the fading influence of a once-dominant comedic style.</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has claimed that FBI agents reviewing files related to Jeffrey Epstein's criminal case were instructed to specifically "flag" any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump. In letters to the Justice Department and the FBI, Durbin questioned the rationale behind this directive and the decision to reassign hundreds of personnel to review the records under a tight deadline. This development adds to the scrutiny over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein files, particularly the decision not to release more evidence to the public. The senator is demanding an explanation for these apparent discrepancies and instructions.</p>

On Thursday, ether-based ETFs saw higher daily inflows than bitcoin ETFs for the first time, signaling a potential shift in market leadership. Analysts note that ether's recent performance could indicate a trend reversal, as the new law is expected to embed stablecoins more deeply into the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a federal push for more states to implement such requirements, Georgia's struggles demonstrate the potential for bureaucratic inefficiency and wasted taxpayer dollars.

While Trump denied reports that he was likely to fire Powell, he maintained that the Fed's current rates are harming the economy and the housing market. Economists note that the Fed has held rates steady due to persistent inflation risks, which are partly influenced by the administration's tariff policies. The article explains that a premature rate cut could reignite inflation, ultimately leading to a more painful economic adjustment for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and historian Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the centuries-old mystery of the two princes in the Tower of London. Contrary to the popular narrative that they were murdered by their uncle, Richard III, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting both princes survived. The research challenges the historical account largely shaped by the Tudor dynasty that succeeded Richard III. Langley argues that documents point to the elder prince, Edward V, living on under a different identity, shifting the burden of proof to those who maintain the murder theory.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been extradited from California to Oregon to face a second-degree murder charge in the 1983 death of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni. Peroni, 27, disappeared after a party where she was last seen with Sanfratello. Her skull was found in 1997, but the case remained cold until it was reopened in 2024. Investigators used modern forensic testing and re-interviewed witnesses, leading to a grand jury indictment against Sanfratello. The Oregon Attorney General highlighted the case as an example of how new technology can bring progress to decades-old investigations.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for severe weather as the Met Office has issued an amber warning for thunderstorms and torrential rain, particularly in south-east England. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday, creating a high risk of dangerous flash floods. The heavy downpours follow a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, exacerbating the flood risk. The severe weather is expected to cause significant disruption to transport, potential power cuts, and flooding of homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>The European Union has adopted a new, extensive package of sanctions against Russia aimed at crippling its war machine and pressuring Moscow to end the conflict in Ukraine. The measures include a dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on transactions via Nord Stream pipelines, and an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the EU has sanctioned more Russian banks, numerous shipping vessels in Russia's "shadow fleet," and over two dozen entities, including some in China and Turkey, for supplying dual-use technologies.

          <p>The nation's 37 tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) are facing a severe funding crisis due to a proposed 90% budget cut from the Trump administration for the 2026 fiscal year. These institutions are heavily reliant on federal funding, and leaders warn that such drastic reductions could force many to close their doors, severely impacting Indigenous students and communities. The proposed cuts are seen by advocates as a betrayal of treaty obligations and a direct attack on tribal self-determination. In response, school leaders, students, and non-profits are lobbying Congress to prevent the cuts and uphold the federal government's commitment to Indigenous education.</p>

The State Department confirmed the decision, stating it could not find "eligible buyers" due to rules restricting aid to organizations involved with abortion services. Critics, including Democratic senators, have condemned the move as a waste of taxpayer money and an abdication of U.S. leadership in global health, noting the urgent need for these supplies in many countries.
