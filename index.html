          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. This proposal has faced criticism from Conservative Party leaders who describe it as "free movement through the back door". Starmer insists that the scheme is not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, as Labour has a "red line in our manifesto about freedom of movement" and that "youth mobility is not freedom of movement". The BBC reports that an agreement in principle is expected at Monday's summit, though the final details are still under negotiation, with the EU pushing for longer stays than the UK is willing to consider.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs onto customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had stated that the magnitude and speed of price increases were creating a challenging environment. Walmart responded that it would continue working to keep prices as low as possible, absorbing some costs and expecting suppliers to do the same.

          <p>The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) reported record revenues and member payouts for the 2023-24 season, but also saw a significant increase in legal expenses due to lawsuits from Clemson and Florida State. The league's revenue increased to $711.4 million, allowing an average payout of nearly $45 million to its football-playing members. The launch of the ESPN-partnered ACC Network has boosted TV revenue, but legal expenses jumped by 70.2% amid challenges to the league's exit fees. The ACC has revamped its revenue-distribution plan to factor in TV viewership and reward top-draw schools, aiming to generate more revenue amid a growing gap behind the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences.</p>

The discovery reveals that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts, with a multi-segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills.

          <p>The release of audio recordings from former President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals a president struggling to recall dates and details, confirming concerns about his age and mental acuity. The audio, obtained by Axios, contrasts with Democrats' previous assurances of Biden's sharpness and competence. The recording highlights Biden's memory lapses, digressions, and struggles to maintain focus, reinforcing Hur's assessment that a jury would perceive him as a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory". The article suggests that the release of the audio may prompt Democrats to confront the reality of Biden's cognitive state.</p>
