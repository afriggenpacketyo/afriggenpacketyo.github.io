          <p>Peter R. Orszag, former director of the Office of Management and Budget, argues that America's fiscal situation has significantly deteriorated, warranting serious concern. Annual federal budget deficits are high, interest rates have more than doubled, and the government is projected to spend more on interest payments than on defense, Medicaid, or Medicare. Orszag suggests eliminating the debt limit, extending the maturity of Treasury debt, and generating fiscal savings in entitlement programs. He cautions that the current budget legislation would exacerbate the challenges and emphasizes the need to reduce the budget deficit to manage fiscal risks and achieve trade goals.

Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles III to formally open Canada's 45th session of parliament.

          <p>Keith Hackett, a former referees' boss, has criticized the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for appointing Thomas Bramall to officiate the Aston Villa vs. Manchester United match. Hackett deemed it a "poor management decision," arguing that Bramall, an inexperienced referee, was assigned to a high-stakes game. Hackett also questioned why top referee Michael Oliver was assigned to VAR duties instead of officiating the match, suggesting a more experienced official should have been in charge. </p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed rare criticism of Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, condemning the attacks on civilian targets. However, he has not taken concrete action to increase pressure on Russia, such as joining European sanctions or providing additional aid to Ukraine. This contrasts with his previous stance and raises questions about the U.S. commitment to addressing the conflict. Despite criticizing Putin, Trump has maintained his desire for a summit and has not linked his actions to any tangible consequences for Russia.</p>

          <p>A pursuit that began in Imperial Beach ended with the closure of both northbound and southbound lanes of Interstate 5 near Carmel Valley. The chase started after a San Diego County Sheriff's Department deputy attempted a traffic stop on a reckless driver. California Highway Patrol (CHP) took over, deploying a spike strip and a pit maneuver to stop the vehicle. The driver, suspected to be under the influence, resisted arrest, requiring officers to use gas to safely take him into custody, causing significant traffic delays in the area.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union to allow officials from both sides to start a new negotiating push and reach a trade deal. The goal is to find some solution before July 9, when the 50 percent levies are now set to take effect. The United States and the European Union still have different priorities, ones that could remain an obstacle to a rapid agreement, and it is not clear that either the demands or offers on the table have changed. </p>

          <p>A century after electric vehicles (EVs) faded from prominence, the US may be poised to repeat history as the Trump administration undermines their growth.

Republican leaders aim to eliminate EV subsidies and impose new fees, potentially setting the industry back. The article draws parallels between the gender stereotypes and marketing tactics of the past and present, highlighting the complex factors influencing the adoption of EVs. </p>

          <p>Market analysts are advising investors to prepare for potential volatility despite President Trump's delay of 50% tariffs on the European Union. While the delay provides a window for negotiations, significant uncertainty remains, and experts caution that trade tensions could escalate.

The effectiveness of Trump's negotiation tactics and the ultimate outcome of the trade discussions are uncertain. </p>

          <p>Nine European Union member states, led by Italy and Denmark, are advocating for a "new interpretation" of the European Convention on Human Rights. The letter calls for "more room" to "decide on when to expel criminal foreign nationals" and "more freedom" to track "criminal foreigners who cannot be deported." This move has sparked controversy and concerns about judicial independence in Europe.
