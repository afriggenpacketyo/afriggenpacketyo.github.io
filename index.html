          <p>A sniper who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing one detainee and wounding two others, left behind a note expressing a desire to inflict "real terror" on the agency's agents. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, revealing the shooter had researched ICE agent locations and downloaded security documents. The attack occurs amid heightened political rhetoric and a significant increase in assaults against ICE personnel, prompting officials to place all agency facilities on higher alert and call for an end to inflammatory language against law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a deal to prevent a ban on TikTok in the United States, allowing its parent company ByteDance to retain a minority stake. Under the agreement, the cloud computing firm Oracle will host American user data and review the app's code to ensure security and proper algorithm behavior. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake in the new U.S.-based joint venture. However, some lawmakers have expressed concern that the deal may not go far enough to sever operational ties with ByteDance, particularly concerning its influential content algorithm.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital identification scheme, arguing it would help combat illegal working and modernize state services. The proposal revives an idea previously blocked by a Conservative-led coalition, with Starmer suggesting the public's attitude has shifted due to the widespread use of digital credentials. The plan has drawn skepticism from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and condemnation from Reform UK, which labeled it a cynical ploy that would infringe on the freedoms of law-abiding citizens while failing to deter illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is facing renewed criticism for not returning or donating $32,000 in campaign contributions it received from the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the mid-1990s. This stands in contrast to several other Democratic politicians and committees that have disavowed similar funds following Epstein's federal charges in 2019. A DNC spokesperson dismissed the issue as related to "decades-old contributions" while continuing to criticize the Trump administration over its own connections to Epstein, prompting accusations of hypocrisy from political opponents.</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives improperly released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her Republican opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosed file contained highly sensitive personal information, including her Social Security number and home addresses, in a potential violation of the Privacy Act. The National Personnel Records Center acknowledged the "egregious blunder," attributing it to a technician who failed to follow standard procedures, and has since apologized to the congresswoman and launched an internal review.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it used deceptive practices to enroll customers into its Prime membership program and made cancellation intentionally difficult. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in any FTC rule violation case, and allocates $1.5 billion for refunds to approximately 35 million affected customers. As part of the agreement, Amazon must also make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent and straightforward for consumers, though the company did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

The proposed fee hike over the next five years aims to make the system self-funding, with the government claiming the saved money would represent a "funding boost for Ofsted to improve state schools."</p>

          <p>The founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), who acquired the brands of bankrupt retailers like RadioShack and Pier 1 Imports, have been accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of running a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The lawsuit alleges that Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez defrauded hundreds of investors by falsely claiming their portfolio companies were profitable and generating strong cash flow. Instead, they allegedly used money from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones and diverted at least $16 million for their own personal use.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a "phased restart" of its operations after a major cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. The company reports that some financial and parts logistics systems are back online, allowing it to process payments and clear a backlog of orders for spare parts. However, JLR's three UK car manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month, and concerns are growing for the financial stability of the many small businesses in its supply chain affected by the prolonged halt.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered by a road in Spain in 2005 has finally been identified as Liudmila Zavada, a Russian national who was 31 at the time of her death. The breakthrough in the 20-year-old cold case came as part of Interpol's "Identify Me" campaign, which shares details of unsolved cases internationally. Police in Turkey matched the victim's fingerprints to their national database, and a subsequent DNA test with a close relative confirmed her identity, bringing a name to the victim long known only as "the woman in pink."</p>

          <p>A new paper by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb suggests that 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, is significantly larger and more massive than scientists initially thought. By analyzing its trajectory and the rate at which it shed gas and dust, Loeb's team inferred a mass greater than 33 billion tons and a diameter of over three miles. This would make it orders of magnitude more massive than previous interstellar visitors, deepening the mystery surrounding its origins and its unusually close trajectory to several planets, including Mars.</p>
