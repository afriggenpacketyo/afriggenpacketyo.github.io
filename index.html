The arrests follow criticism and public outcry regarding safety measures at the event, where tens of thousands gathered. The government has also suspended five senior police officers, including the city's police chief, citing "negligence and irresponsibility" in connection with the incident, which is under investigation.

          <p>Israeli forces launched airstrikes on a southern suburb of Beirut, targeting what they claim was a Hezbollah drone production unit, amid escalating tensions between Israel and the Iranian-backed group.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the strikes as a violation of international accords, while the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon emphasized the importance of diplomacy.

          <p>A public dispute has erupted between former allies Donald Trump and Elon Musk after Musk criticized Trump's "big, beautiful" spending bill, leading to a series of insults traded on social media.

The feud has sparked reactions from politicians and business leaders, with some urging reconciliation and others calling for investigations into Musk's government contracts. The conflict began after Musk, who briefly served in the Trump administration, publicly criticized the spending bill, leading Trump to defend the legislation and question Musk's motives.

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, coupled with weak domestic demand, has led to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among global economies about potential harm to local industries. Despite tariffs deterring exports to the U.S., Chinese producer prices have remained in deflationary territory, while consumer inflation is near zero. However, economists suggest that this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to inflation-hit economies, potentially leading to more rate cuts across Asia. For markets with limited manufacturing, such as Australia, cheap Chinese imports could alleviate the cost-of-living crisis and help lower inflationary pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked a proclamation by President Donald Trump that sought to ban foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University. The judge, Allison Burroughs, stated that Harvard had demonstrated it would sustain "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced before she could hear from all parties involved. Harvard had filed a legal challenge, arguing that the proclamation was illegal retaliation for the university's rejection of White House demands. The ruling extends a previous temporary hold on the administration's attempts to restrict Harvard's international student enrollment. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to job losses and wage cuts, new research from PwC suggests that AI actually increases the value of workers. The 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, which analyzed over 800 million job ads, found that both jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations, including those most susceptible to automation. The report challenges six common myths about AI's impact, highlighting that AI is driving productivity growth, increasing wages for workers with AI skills, and enriching jobs by freeing employees to focus on more complex tasks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales are collapsing annually due to lost, damaged, or missing police evidence, according to a BBC investigation. Data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reveals that over 30,000 prosecutions failed between October 2020 and September 2024, including serious violent and sexual offenses. The increase in collapsed cases is attributed to resourcing issues and cuts to police forces, leading to challenges in storing and managing evidence. Former police officers and experts believe the loss of the dedicated Forensic Science Service in 2012 has contributed to the problem, as police forces now struggle with evidence storage and expertise.

          <p>Sweden's Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson has expressed concerns about the impact of U.S. trade tariffs on the country's economy and households. The tariffs, imposed by President Donald Trump, have created uncertainty in financial markets and shaken household confidence, particularly among the large portion of Swedes who invest in funds and stock markets. The Swedish economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, and the finance ministry has revised its growth forecasts downward, citing tariffs as a contributing factor. While Sweden's public finances remain solid, the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy is hurting the country's growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The recent death of three congressional Democrats has further amplified these concerns, bolstering the Republicans' majority in Congress.

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban, restricting foreign nationals from 19 countries, comes as part of a broader effort to implement stricter immigration policies. This ban follows a series of measures, including suspending the asylum system, ending temporary legal residency for various groups, and restricting student visas. Experts note that these actions create layers of restrictions, significantly disrupting immigration practices.
