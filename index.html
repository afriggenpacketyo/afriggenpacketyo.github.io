          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, shares his excitement about the show's first episode set in Nigeria, a significant milestone for the series. Growing up in the 1980s, Kukoyi was captivated by the time-traveling Doctor, viewing him as a guiding figure. The episode, set in Lagos, marks the first time the show is primarily set in Africa and features a vibrant barber shop, a bustling market, and potentially Anansi, a West African folklore character. The article also touches on why it has taken 62 years for the Doctor to visit Africa, suggesting a lack of confidence in telling authentic African stories and the Doctor's need to blend in, which is now changing with the casting of Ncuti Gatwa, an actor of African descent.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has advocated for the reopening and substantial enlargement of Alcatraz prison to house America's most violent offenders. In a Truth Social post, Trump described the need to rebuild and open Alcatraz as a symbol of law, order, and justice, citing the plague of repeat criminal offenders. The article provides a brief history of Alcatraz and profiles some of its most infamous inmates, including Al Capone, George "Machine Gun" Kelly, Robert Stroud (the "Birdman of Alcatraz"), Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, and Morton Sobell. It notes that during its 30 years as a federal prison, Alcatraz housed over 1,500 inmates.</p>

          <p>As formal trade talks resume between China and the United States, analysts predict a wide range of outcomes, from a deal that reduces tariffs to a complete breakdown. The best-case scenario would be a pause in tariffs similar to what the US offered other countries, while the worst-case would involve either party walking out without an agreement, causing market instability. Since President Trump's return to the White House, tariffs on Chinese imports have increased significantly, prompting retaliatory measures from China. The article highlights the high stakes of these negotiations for the global economy.</p>

          <p>Russia has stated that a precondition for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine is the cessation of arms supplies from the United States and the European Union to Kiev. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov argued that without this condition, Ukraine would use the ceasefire to mobilize troops and train personnel. Peskov expressed hope that President Trump would influence Ukraine to engage in talks, claiming Ukraine is avoiding negotiations. This announcement comes as European leaders convene in Kyiv and as the three-day pause in fighting, ordered by Putin, concludes.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes Xi Jinping's long-term strategy to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, positioning China as a dominant force in global supply chains. Since 2020, Xi has ramped up exports, deepened China’s manufacturing base, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls and blacklists. This strategy aims to deter foreign parties from disrupting supplies to China and challenges the supremacy of the United States. While China still relies on the West for some advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain may cleave the world into competing spheres of influence.</p>

          <p>Fighting between India and Pakistan has intensified, with both sides targeting air bases and military sites, each accusing the other of initiating the attacks. Pakistan reported that India targeted three of its air bases, while India claimed it struck Pakistani military targets in response to drone attacks. The escalating conflict has prompted international concern and diplomatic efforts from various countries to de-escalate tensions. Despite claims from both sides that they want to de-escalate, the confrontation has only intensified since India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan earlier in the week.</p>
