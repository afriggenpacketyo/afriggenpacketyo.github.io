          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at the Delaney Hall detention center during a visit with members of New Jersey's congressional delegation, being charged with trespassing. Baraka says he was there to support the members of Congress touring the facility, while U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba stated that he ignored warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center. Gov. Phil Murphy expressed outrage over Baraka's arrest, while congressmembers Menendez and Watson Coleman claim the arrest was an act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs is implementing job cuts as part of the DOGE initiative, aiming to reduce its workforce by 15%. Secretary Doug Collins insists that these cuts will not affect veterans' health care, but concerns are raised about existing shortages of medical providers. VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz stated that deferred resignations for health care staff will only be approved in limited circumstances to fulfill mission needs. Veterans and VA staff express concerns that the cuts could impact veteran benefits and health care, with employees fearing the mental stress of job insecurity will affect patient care.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a major shopping destination amid the intensifying trade war with the United States. The island plans to launch its own separate customs regime, avoiding the high retaliatory tariffs Beijing has placed on American imports. The hope is that the promise of cheaper US goods, such as iPhones and cosmetics, will drive a surge in visitors to Hainan's duty-free stores, which have struggled due to sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The ruling stated that the administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government likely exceed its legal authority, requiring Congressional cooperation. The restraining order affects 20 federal agencies and blocks further cuts or administrative leave related to the executive order, remaining in effect for at least 14 days while the case is considered.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are advancing Senate Bill 17, designed to prevent hostile foreign powers like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing land in the state. The bill prohibits entities and individuals affiliated with governments designated as national security threats from buying real estate if it poses risks to public health or safety. The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals through court-ordered receivership. The bill includes exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and property intended as a personal homestead.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting productions to the UK due to generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized national funding for film. President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries has created uncertainty in the industry. Several major Hollywood films, including Barbie, Jurassic World: Dominion, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and The Batman, have been filmed in the UK, taking advantage of the country's financial benefits and diverse locations.</p>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person to challenge their detention in court, to address the illegal immigration problem. The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in cases of rebellion or invasion when public safety requires it. Legal experts argue that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress. This potential move would curtail a constitutional right to due process for migrants.</p>

          <p>An upcoming BBC drama series, The Bombing of Pan Am 103, dramatizes the Scots-US investigation into the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and its impact on victims' families and Lockerbie's locals. Kara Weipz, whose brother died in the bombing, recalls learning of his death through a news report, highlighting flaws in the victim response system. Lobbying by UK and US-based family groups resulted in key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening, to people-centered responses to major disasters. The drama also portrays the strength of bonds forged between people in the wake of the bombing.</p>

          <p>Experts say that the economies of the world’s two biggest countries are highly intertwined and pulling apart would inflict pain equally on both sides. Since Trump returned to the White House in January, imposing tariffs on America’s trading partners and upending the global trade order. China has borne the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, with goods from China penalized with levies of as much as 145 per cent. Mutual trust between the two sides has significantly declined, and once trust is lost, financial relations are particularly vulnerable, as finance relies heavily on commitments across time.</p>
