          <p>China has announced it is considering U.S. overtures to begin trade negotiations, signaling a potential path toward resolving the ongoing trade war that has unsettled financial markets. A spokesperson for the commerce ministry stated that senior U.S. officials have reached out multiple times, expressing interest in starting talks on tariffs. However, Chinese authorities reiterated that the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity and build mutual trust. President Trump has imposed tariffs of 145% on imported Chinese goods, leading to retaliatory levies of 125% from China, with both sides granting exemptions on some products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene impacted East Tennessee waterways seven months ago. The study aims to determine if excessive debris from the hurricane has negatively affected the sport fish population by comparing current data to surveys from the past 30 years, looking for deformities or injuries. Structures like debris can provide fish a place to lay eggs, hunt and feed, so the disruption of the shoreline habitat may force fish to find a new place to congregate. Sport fishing accounts for about 80% of tourism in the area, bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 23:13:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has approved a measure to overturn an EPA rule tied to the Clean Air Act that limits emissions of seven hazardous air pollutants from heavy industry. The 52-46 vote, along party lines, marks the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act in its 55-year history. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required major sources of pollutants like mercury and PCBs to maintain strict pollution controls, but Republicans argue it disincentivizes companies from adopting new pollution-reducing technologies. Environmental groups have criticized the move, saying it will allow polluters to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer and other health problems.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to accelerate tariff talks, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement possibly by June, following progress in discussions. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief negotiator, stated that ministerial discussions will intensify from mid-May after preliminary talks, focusing on non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation. While emphasizing Japan's commitment to protecting its national interests, Akazawa acknowledged the possibility of a deal during a potential meeting between Prime Minister Ishigeru Ishiba and President Trump at the G7 summit in Canada. Japan is considering increasing purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and simplifying screening processes for imported cars as part of the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio now holds four key government positions: Secretary of State, Acting Administrator of USAID, Acting Archivist for the National Archives, and Interim National Security Advisor. This accumulation of roles is unprecedented in modern U.S. history, raising questions about his capacity to effectively manage each position, particularly under President Trump's unconventional governing style. The appointment was unexpected, with State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce learning of it during a press conference. While some view this as a sign of Trump's trust in Rubio, others express concern about potential conflicts of interest and the practical challenges of managing such diverse responsibilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor, nominating him as ambassador to the United Nations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will temporarily replace Waltz while continuing his duties as America's top diplomat. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed, which likely influenced the decision. Sources indicate Trump respects Waltz but also perceived issues with his vetting of National Security Council staff. Some officials suggest the administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing for his complete removal without direct firing.</p>

Apple's sales in China fell 2.3% in the last quarter, while overall earnings and revenue increased.

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to allow the removal of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously terminated an extension of TPS granted by the Biden administration, leading to a lawsuit alleging procedural violations and racial bias. A federal judge blocked the administration's efforts, citing irreparable harm to hundreds of thousands of people and billions in economic losses. The administration argues that the law creating TPS bars judicial review of executive branch decisions, while the judge contends that his ruling addresses the authorization of Noem's actions.</p>
