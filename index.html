          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, contributing to a significant rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. The unemployment rate for recent graduates aged 22 to 27 is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, with a notable mismatch between the supply of graduates and the demand in certain sectors, particularly technology. Economic uncertainty, driven by factors like tariffs, is also causing businesses to slow hiring, exacerbating the challenges for young graduates, and some are becoming underemployed in roles that don't require a degree.</p>

          <p>During a live broadcast of an American Hockey League playoff game between the Abbotsford Canucks and the Colorado Eagles, Canucks' announcer Brandon Astle was confronted by a rowdy fan who threw a chair, striking him in the leg.

A study showed that even minor track imperfections could cause violent vibrations at cruising speeds of 1,000km/h, leading to an "extremely unpleasant" ride. The engineers, working on a full-scale test line in China, reported reducing turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort to "pronounced, but not unpleasant" levels using supercomputer simulations and prototype tests.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, demonstrating significant progress, but an apparent propellant leak led to a loss of control, causing the spacecraft to re-enter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled and likely disintegrate over the Indian Ocean. The mission, launched from Starbase, Texas, aimed to test payload deployment and heat shield improvements, but the inability to open the payload doors prevented the Starlink satellite deployment test. Despite the challenges, SpaceX continues to gather valuable data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions to the moon and Mars.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but both stages were lost before controlled descents could be achieved. The Super Heavy first stage failed catastrophically upon engine reignition, while the Starship upper stage reached its suborbital trajectory but experienced a door failure preventing the release of simulated Starlink satellites. An apparent propellant leak then caused the Starship to spin out of control, leading to its breakup during reentry; however, Elon Musk noted the mission's significant improvements and valuable data gained, with plans for faster launch cadences in the future.</p>

Rowley cites a decade of underinvestment and new pressures on police forces, emphasizing the need for investment to restore neighborhood policing and halve knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office maintains it is backing the police with significant funding, but Sir Mark argues that a lack of investment will perpetuate structural inefficiencies and hinder reform.</p>

The act would offer incentives for states to start their own fire camp programs and recognize incarcerated firefighters as employees entitled to wage protections. The bill, introduced by Democratic representatives, aims to address the barriers faced by former inmate firefighters in securing employment after release, despite their valuable contributions and bravery.</p>

The bill would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, and impose work requirements on Medicaid, increasing the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
