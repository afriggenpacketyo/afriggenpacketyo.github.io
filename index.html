          <p>The German government has ceased approving new arms exports to Israel following a decision made by Chancellor Friedrich Merz in August. This policy shift, confirmed by the Economy Ministry, comes after increasing criticism of the Israeli government's military actions in the Gaza Strip. While no new deliveries have been approved in the subsequent five weeks, officials maintain that Germany remains committed to Israel's security, evaluating each case individually based on foreign policy considerations and legal requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines the resurgence of "lavender marriages," which historically served as a protective cover for LGBTQ+ individuals in repressive societies. Now, the term is trending on TikTok among younger generations, who are redefining it as a platonic partnership for companionship and to navigate economic challenges like high housing costs. While this modern interpretation highlights evolving perspectives on relationships and marriage, some critics argue that it risks trivializing the oppressive history that once made such arrangements a necessity for survival.</p>

Prosecutors stated the child was brutally beaten over 30 hours in what was described as an "exorcism" intended to expel a demon. Milam's appeals, which included claims of innocence and arguments about unreliable bite-mark evidence, have been denied by the courts. The child's mother, Jesseca Carson, was also convicted of capital murder and is serving a life sentence without parole.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has compelled Ticketmaster to provide clearer information on ticket prices following complaints regarding sales for the Oasis reunion tour. The company must now disclose 24 hours in advance if a tiered pricing system is used and give more details about costs during online queues. The investigation found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" but determined that the labeling of more expensive "platinum" tickets may have been misleading, as they offered no extra benefits.</p>

          <p>The significant increase in housing prices and mortgage rates since the pandemic is compelling some individuals and couples to reconsider their family planning goals. The article profiles people who have chosen to have only one child, or no children at all, because the financial burden of a larger home and childcare has become prohibitive. This trend reflects a broader economic pressure where the high cost of living, particularly for housing, is directly influencing major life decisions and reshaping the concept of the American family.</p>

          <p>An NPR analysis found that an Indiana charter school network, Paramount Schools of Excellence, suspends students with disabilities at approximately three times the state average. While the network is praised for its calm classrooms and strong test scores, some parents argue its strict discipline policies unfairly punish students whose behavior is linked to disabilities like ADHD. The article highlights the debate over whether such exclusionary discipline protects the learning environment or hinders the academic progress of vulnerable students who miss significant instructional time.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has convicted former French President Nicolas Sarkozy of criminal conspiracy related to illicit campaign financing from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He was acquitted of other charges, including passive corruption. The prosecution alleged that Sarkozy accepted millions in funds for his successful 2007 presidential campaign in exchange for helping to rehabilitate Gaddafi's international image. This verdict is the latest in a series of legal troubles for Sarkozy, who has faced multiple corruption investigations since leaving office in 2012.</p>

          <p>Whizz Kids, the leading UK charity providing specialist wheelchairs for children, has been forced to close to new referrals for the first time in its history due to overwhelming demand. The charity warns of a "national crisis," stating that an increasing number of children are being rejected by the NHS for costly, specialized equipment due to budget constraints, placing immense pressure on its services. As a result, thousands of disabled children face long waits, living in discomfort and losing critical childhood experiences while their families struggle for support.</p>

          <p>After striking the Philippines as a super typhoon, a weakened Tropical Storm Ragasa has left a trail of destruction across Southeast Asia, with the death toll reaching at least 25 people. The storm caused 11 fatalities in the Philippines, triggered a deadly lake burst in Taiwan that killed 14, and led to widespread flooding and power outages in China's Guangdong province. Authorities in Hong Kong canceled nearly 1,000 flights, and now Vietnam is preparing for the storm's arrival as it moves further west.</p>
