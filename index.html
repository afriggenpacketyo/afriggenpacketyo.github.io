          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-02 12:05:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists disagree on the extent to which President Trump's tariffs will raise consumer prices. While some models predict a significant increase in inflation, White House economists argue that foreign suppliers will absorb the cost.  The Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged reflects the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the tariffs. The overall effect on the U.S. economy remains a subject of ongoing debate.</p>
