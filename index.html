        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that recent government U-turns on welfare reforms have complicated future spending decisions. She did not commit to scrapping the two-child benefit cap, acknowledging it would have a significant cost, despite its potential to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. The government's retreat from planned welfare cuts, which would have saved £5 billion, now puts pressure on the upcoming budget. Phillipson emphasized that the child poverty taskforce is exploring various measures to support families, including the expansion of family hubs and free school meals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to establish "Best Start" family hubs in every local authority in England by April 2026. These hubs aim to provide a wide range of services, from parenting support and midwifery to debt advice and youth clubs, supporting an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described the initiative as a "lifeline" for families, though the Conservative opposition has questioned the novelty of the plan, suggesting it rebrands existing services. Charities like Save The Children have welcomed the move, highlighting the effectiveness of integrated support services.</p>

          <p>Israel has agreed to send a delegation to Qatar for proximity talks regarding a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling Hamas's proposed amendments "unacceptable." The proposal, brokered by the US, Qatar, and Egypt, involves a 60-day ceasefire. Hamas has reportedly demanded guarantees that hostilities will not resume and changes to Israeli troop withdrawal plans. The decision comes amid ongoing violence in Gaza and pressure from hostages' families in Israel, with US President Donald Trump expressing optimism about a potential deal.</p>

          <p>The United States has deported eight men, who were convicted of serious crimes, to South Sudan following a contentious legal battle. The deportation proceeded after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had required due process hearings for migrants sent to third countries. Only one of the men is a South Sudanese national, with the others being from countries that refused to accept them. The move highlights the Trump administration's policy of expanding deportations to third countries, even to unstable nations like South Sudan, raising concerns about the deportees' fate.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades, the cold case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando condo in 2006, is now considered active again by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). This development comes after new DNA evidence was obtained and persons of interest were narrowed down, partly due to the efforts of Kesse's father, Drew Kesse. The family had previously sued the city for case files and assembled their own team of investigators. The renewed focus offers a glimmer of hope for a breakthrough in the long-stalled investigation into the 24-year-old's disappearance.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind the American evangelical community's silence following the Trump administration's effective shutdown of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Once a celebrated bipartisan initiative credited with saving over 25 million lives, PEPFAR's funding has been frozen, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The author posits that the evangelical silence stems from a combination of factors, including political loyalty to Trump, a lack of awareness, compassion fatigue, and a theological shift towards domestic culture wars over international humanitarianism. The piece contrasts the current indifference with the strong evangelical support that helped launch the program under President George W. Bush.</p>

Historically, this partnership has had operational applications, such as the "Argo" mission, which utilized a fake film production cover to rescue diplomats from Iran.

          <p>Proposed deep budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are causing widespread anxiety within the U.S. scientific community, threatening the future of biomedical research and the careers of young scientists. The White House's proposal to slash nearly 40% of the NIH's budget has led to grant cancellations and layoffs, prompting fears of a "brain drain" as researchers consider opportunities abroad. Critics argue the cuts will halt critical research, disrupt clinical trials, and undermine America's leadership in science and innovation. Despite a recent court ruling reinstating some grants, the long-term damage to the research pipeline remains a significant concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French intelligence has concluded that China used its foreign embassies to actively undermine sales of France's Rafale fighter jet. According to a French intelligence report, Chinese defense attachés spread disinformation about the jet's performance, particularly after its use in the India-Pakistan clashes in May. The campaign allegedly targeted countries that have purchased or are considering purchasing the Rafale, such as Indonesia, encouraging them to opt for Chinese-made aircraft instead. This effort is seen by Paris as a strategic move to damage France's reputation and weaken its security partnerships in Asia.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in central Texas have killed at least 51 people, with a search continuing for 27 girls missing from a Christian summer camp along the Guadalupe River. The disaster, triggered by up to a foot of rain falling in a few hours, has raised serious questions about the adequacy of weather warnings. While forecasters issued alerts, local officials and residents said they did not anticipate the "catastrophic" intensity of the flood, which caused the river to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. The tragedy has put a spotlight on the region's vulnerability to flash floods and the effectiveness of its emergency notification systems.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in participants within weeks. The clinical trial, detailed in *Nature Medicine*, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene. The therapy delivers a functional copy of the gene to the inner ear, restoring the transmission of sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly full hearing.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, UK, has expressed frustration with the justice system after a shoplifter he apprehended received no significant punishment. The owner, Andrew Board, physically stopped a man who walked out of his store with a crate of beer and brought him back. Despite the thief admitting to the offense, police dealt with it via a "community resolution," requiring only that he pay for the beer and be banned from the shop. The incident highlights a national trend where a majority of reported shoplifting offenses go unpunished, which retailers argue fails to deter repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are facing a rapid decline, with dozens closing each year due to a severe shortage of new members. The number of nuns in German Catholic orders has plummeted from over 93,000 in 1960 to under 10,000 today, forcing many to sell their historic properties. Experts attribute the trend to the church's diminished societal influence and increased professional opportunities for women outside religious life. This decline has broader societal impacts, as religious orders have historically run many schools and hospitals, and their closures represent a significant cultural shift.</p>

The July 9 deadline for trade negotiations is approaching, though the possibility of a full deal is considered "impossible," with an "agreement in principle" being the best-case scenario. Simultaneously, the OPEC International Seminar in Vienna will precede a weekend meeting of OPEC+ members, where a decision on oil output is highly anticipated amid recent price fluctuations. These events create a tense backdrop for investors and policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between excitement and inhibition in neural activity. This balance is strongly linked to the brain's information processing capabilities and overall cognitive function. The study, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, establishes brain criticality as a biological phenotype with a genetic foundation. This finding opens new avenues for understanding brain function and the potential genetic roots of neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>
