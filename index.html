        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Parts of Juneau, Alaska, are under evacuation orders due to anticipated record flooding from an outburst of the Mendenhall Glacier. The event, caused by the release of water from Suicide Basin, is an annual occurrence linked to climate change but is predicted to reach unprecedented levels this year. Authorities have installed temporary barriers to protect hundreds of homes, as previous floods have caused significant damage, including sweeping away houses. The phenomenon is expected to continue for decades as long as the glacier acts as a dam.</p>

          <p>McDonald's in Japan has canceled its Happy Meal campaign featuring Pokémon cards after it led to widespread issues with adult resellers. These resellers bought the meals in bulk solely for the collectible cards, discarding large amounts of food and causing it to sell out in a single day. The company apologized, stating the situation contradicted its family-focused philosophy and pledged to implement measures like purchase limits to prevent future occurrences. The incident sparked public frustration, with many criticizing the resellers for their greed.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's summer trip to the United Kingdom was met with protests in the Cotswolds, where locals organized a "Vance not welcome party." Demonstrators held signs with messages like "Bullies not welcome here" and used humor to mock the official, creating a "joyous festival of resistance," according to organizers. The protest, organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, was reportedly attended by about 80 people who expressed anger over Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's foreign policy positions.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. saw a significant 23% increase last week, reaching its highest level since last April. The spike was largely driven by homeowners seeking lower payments, with a notable 25% jump in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) due to their more attractive initial rates compared to fixed-rate loans. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, borrowers with larger loan sizes are particularly sensitive to rate movements. In contrast, applications for home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a by-the-numbers look at Uzo Aduba's Emmy nomination for lead actress in a comedy for the Netflix series "The Residence." It highlights her strong track record with voters, noting this is her sixth nomination and she has won three previous Emmys for her work on "Orange Is the New Black" and "Mrs. America." However, her chances this year are complicated by the fact that "The Residence" was canceled after just one season. She also faces a highly competitive category, with four of the five nominees already being past Emmy winners.</p>

          <p>Actress Rashida Jones reflects on her Emmy nomination for the "Black Mirror" episode "Common People," where she plays a woman whose consciousness is saved via a brain subscription service after a coma. The episode serves as a dark parable about capitalism, corporate greed, and the American healthcare system. Jones discusses how the series reflects our current reality, where technology slowly erodes privacy and agency in the name of efficiency. To escape the dystopian feel of modern life, she emphasizes the importance of disconnecting and connecting with nature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, researchers have created a comprehensive map of the approximately 8,700 cattle feeding operations in the U.S., finding that California has more than any other state. The study, from the University of Michigan and UC Santa Barbara, also identified Tulare County as the county with the highest concentration of feedlots in the nation. The research links these confined animal feeding operations to degraded air quality and lower socioeconomic well-being in nearby communities. This new database is intended to help develop more targeted environmental and health policies.</p>

          <p>A UC Santa Barbara professor argues that President Trump's demand for a $1 billion payment from UCLA is fundamentally different from pressuring private universities like Columbia. The author asserts that because the University of California is a public institution, this action constitutes an attempted seizure of state tax dollars. The article highlights the UC system's massive economic contribution to California and its role as an engine of growth and education for the state's residents. The author calls on Californians to resist what they describe as a federal overreach and an attempt to "steal" public funds.</p>

          <p>As Social Security marks its 90th anniversary, this article argues that the greatest threat to its future is not fiscal insolvency but a long-term Republican project to dismantle and privatize it. The author contends that recent actions, such as staffing cuts and the creation of private savings accounts, are part of a strategy to weaken public trust in the system. The piece emphasizes Social Security's vital role in preventing old-age poverty for millions. It concludes that preserving the program requires vigilance and fiscal fixes like removing the payroll tax cap. (not investment advice)</p>

The article lists several models, including the all-electric Nissan Leaf and Hyundai Kona Electric, as well as plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Kia Niro. While these vehicles offer a more affordable entry point into the EV market, they often come with trade-offs such as shorter range or slower charging speeds.

          <p>As the new school year begins, Los Angeles public schools are taking unprecedented steps to protect students and their families from federal immigration enforcement actions. Measures include "safe zones" patrolled by police near schools, altered bus routes, and community volunteers acting as lookouts to warn of nearby raids. The actions come in response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation drive and incidents like a 15-year-old boy being mistakenly handcuffed by federal agents outside his high school. School officials have vowed to oppose any interference with children's right to an education.</p>

          <p>A campaign in Los Angeles called "Save Our Services," which presents itself as a grassroots effort to solve the city's budget crisis, is actually backed by short-term rental giant Airbnb. The campaign's fliers and website advocate for amending city law to allow rentals of second homes, which would benefit Airbnb, but the company's involvement is not disclosed on the materials. The campaign is framed as a way to generate tax revenue for city services, but critics argue it's a deceptive tactic that could worsen the housing crisis.

          <p>The Wonderful Company, one of California's largest agricultural employers, is closing a large grape nursery in the Central Valley, a move that follows an effort by the United Farm Workers (UFW) to unionize its employees. The company states the closure is a "purely a business decision" due to a downturn in the grape industry and is donating the farm to UC Davis. However, labor experts and some employees question the timing, suggesting it could be a tactic to avoid unionization. The UFW has raised concerns about the layoffs and the closure's impact on hundreds of workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., has raised concerns among California officials that similar federal actions could be taken in their state, particularly in cities like Oakland and Los Angeles. Trump has mentioned these cities by name and suggested using the military to protect the 2028 L.A. Olympics. Legal experts note that deploying federal troops for domestic law enforcement without a governor's request is highly unusual and legally questionable, potentially violating the Posse Comitatus Act. Mayors of the targeted cities have described the president's comments as fear-mongering.</p>
