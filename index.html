          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant flash flooding risk to the Carolinas and Virginia. The system is bringing heavy rainfall, with up to six inches expected in some areas, prompting flood watches and causing road collapses in North Carolina. Emergency crews are conducting rescues of stranded motorists as rivers surge to near-record levels. Forecasters also warn of dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast for the next several days.</p>

          <p>Rescue crews have found the bodies of seven people who were reported missing after a fireworks warehouse exploded last week in the rural Northern California community of Esparto. The powerful explosion occurred following a fire at the facility, sending plumes of smoke and pyrotechnics into the air. The warehouse was managed by Devastating Pyrotechnics, an experienced fireworks show production company. The cause of the blast is currently under investigation by multiple agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as the community mourns the loss.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS group of developing nations, meeting in Rio de Janeiro, have issued a joint declaration condemning President Trump's "indiscriminate" tariff policies. They expressed serious concerns that such unilateral measures distort global trade and undermine economic development, while reaffirming their commitment to multilateral diplomacy. The summit took place as Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with what he termed BRICS's "Anti-American policies." The meeting was notably missing Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who attended via videoconference.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown remarkable success in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a clinical trial demonstrating significant hearing improvement in all participants within weeks. The treatment involves a single injection that delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, addressing a protein deficiency that disrupts sound signal transmission. Researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet reported that the therapy was safe, well-tolerated, and particularly effective in children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has created uncertainty in global markets after officials gave conflicting signals about the implementation of new tariffs. While a previously announced 90-day pause was set to expire on July 9, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the new rates would now take effect on August 1. This extension offers a brief reprieve for trade partners but plunges importers into a prolonged period of ambiguity. The confusion was compounded by President Trump's own uncertain statements, causing Asian stock markets to slip amid the lack of clarity on U.S. trade policy.</p>

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson called it a "complex and sensitive area" but committed to strengthening support for children.

The system is designed to overcome the limitations of current sensors, offering faster computation with lower energy consumption. By mimicking the human visual system's ability to adjust and remember light settings, this technology could lead to significant advancements in areas like autonomous driving and robotics. The development represents a key step forward in creating more efficient and powerful artificial vision systems.</p>

Officials stated that the deluge, which saw the Guadalupe River rise almost 30 feet, was far more severe than forecasted and that some areas lacked reliable cell coverage for alerts. While the National Weather Service defended its issuance of warnings hours before the event, some critics point to budget cuts and staffing issues as potential factors that may have impacted the response.

While Musk's wealth is substantial, creating a national party structure is a multi-year project, making it an unlikely force by the 2026 midterms.

          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people essential time to grieve without worrying about work. The move, which will entitle parents to at least one week of leave, has been welcomed by campaigners and charities as a crucial step in acknowledging the significant impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>As part of a new strategy to improve early childhood education, the UK government will offer qualified nursery teachers tax-free payments of £4,500 to work in disadvantaged areas. The incentive is designed to attract and retain skilled staff in 20 targeted areas where the educational attainment gap is most acute. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the £1.5 billion 'Best Start in Life' strategy aims to give the youngest children a better foundation. The plan also includes more frequent inspections for nurseries and funding for new local youth and parent support hubs.</p>

          <p>The uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy is compelling companies to undertake radical and costly shifts in their global supply chains. This article examines how businesses, from American toymakers to Canadian restaurant chains, are moving production out of China to countries like Vietnam and India to avoid steep tariffs. These moves are fraught with their own risks, including whether new factories can handle capacity and the significant expense of establishing new relationships.

          <p>In a message marking the 20th anniversary of the 7/7 London attacks, King Charles has called for people to stand united against those who seek to divide society. He condemned the "senseless acts of evil" on July 7, 2005, when suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's public transport system. The King praised the courage and compassion shown in the aftermath and emphasized the importance of building a society where all faiths can coexist with mutual respect. Commemorative events, including a national service at St Paul's Cathedral, will be held to remember the victims.</p>

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have become significantly more sophisticated, but the nature of the threat has grown more complex. This article details the evolution from combating organized groups like al-Qaeda to confronting lone-wolf attacks inspired by online radicalization from both Islamist and far-right extremists. While enhanced surveillance, new laws, and prevention programs have disrupted dozens of plots, the rise of DIY terrorism and the Manchester Arena bombing show that vulnerabilities remain. The challenge now is countering a diverse and rapidly changing threat landscape.</p>

          <p>A Metropolitan Police officer who was one of the first responders to the 7/7 London bombings has shared her harrowing experience two decades after the attacks. Superintendent Anna Bearman, then a 23-year-old constable, described the chilling moment she realized an initial report of a fire was actually a major terrorist incident. She recounted walking into the dark, smoke-filled tunnels to carry out injured victims who had lost limbs, with the shock of the day setting in only after she noticed her trousers were stained with blood. Her story provides a visceral, ground-level perspective on the tragedy that struck the city.</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, the man accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, has died in federal custody in what his former attorney says is being investigated as a suicide. Park's death closes the only prosecution in the mysterious bombing, which killed the alleged bomber, Guy Bartkus. The incident has also drawn scrutiny to the conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, where Park was held. Attorneys have raised concerns about unmet medical needs and "inhumane" conditions at the facility, following a recent Justice Department report that found significant shortcomings in emergency responses at federal prisons.</p>
