          <h2>No Charges Filed Against Police Officer in Teen E-Bike Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-07 06:37:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has announced that a police officer who followed two teenagers before their fatal e-bike crash in Cardiff will not face criminal charges due to insufficient evidence for a conviction. The officer, along with another in the vehicle, had previously received gross misconduct notices. The deaths of Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, sparked a riot in the Ely suburb of the city, highlighting community tensions and concerns about police conduct. The decision not to prosecute has likely renewed discussions around police accountability and safety measures for young e-bike users.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariff policies are alienating key voter groups, including young voters, voters of color, and independents, who prioritized economic concerns in the 2024 election. Polling data indicates that these voters are increasingly dissatisfied with Trump's handling of the economy and inflation, particularly regarding the tariffs. While his core MAGA base remains supportive, this disconnect threatens the future of his broader coalition and could impact the upcoming midterm elections. These voters are concerned that the tariffs will lead to higher prices for everyday goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose large tariffs on all foreign imports has triggered a global trade war and predictions of an imminent recession. The US is at risk of slipping into stagflation, a combination of stagnant growth, rising inflation, and elevated unemployment. Trump's tariffs function as taxes on imported goods, which can increase inflation and slow growth. While economists disagree on whether the trade war will lead to a recession or prolonged period of stagflation, the consequences of Trump's tariffs are difficult to anticipate, especially since they could trigger unpredictable responses from America's trade partners.</p>

          <p>Travelers across the UK are bracing for significant disruptions during the Easter holidays, with potential delays affecting roads, trains, and flights. Key intercity rail links will be interrupted due to planned engineering work, particularly over Easter weekend, and airlines are warning of increased flight delays due to air traffic control staff shortages. Road travelers are also expected to encounter heavy traffic on major routes, particularly those leading to and from Channel ports. These factors combine to create a challenging travel environment for those planning to travel over the holiday period.</p>

          <p>Sweeping new tariffs have triggered ructions across financial markets, with global share prices seeing hefty falls, leading to questions about the impact on individuals. Many people's pensions are invested in the markets, and widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers. Timing is more critical for those at retirement age, as this may be when a retiree uses their pension pot to buy a retirement income, or annuity.&#x20;</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could lead to a recession. The drop in oil prices reflects mounting worries that tariffs could increase prices for businesses, leading to a slowdown in economic activity and reduced demand for oil. The move comes after back-to-back 6% declines last week, highlighting the sensitivity of commodity markets to trade policy and economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to trade tariffs imposed by the US. While a ban on producing new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect from 2030, manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines. The changes aim to help the industry adapt to the tariffs while maintaining a commitment to phasing out traditional vehicles, although opposition parties argue that Labour's measures would not be enough to boost the car industry.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields dropped again as President Trump's tariffs spurred a flight to safety while riskier markets took a hit. Investors are reeling from the impact of the tariffs last week, which hit over 180 countries and set a baseline tariff of 10% across the board. The tariffs have stoked fears of a global trade war, as countries respond with their own tariffs on the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he's "open to talking" about trade deals, while downplaying stock losses that have damaged the retirement accounts of millions of Americans. Top officials sent conflicting signals over whether Trump sees the economic warfare he unleashed last week as a lever for near-term dealmaking or whether he's serious about a bid to remake the world economy that could take years. The confusion came against a backdrop of rising discomfort among some Republican lawmakers about the trade onslaught and as massive crowds across the country held anti-Trump protests.</p>
