          <p>Representatives from Ukraine and Russia will meet for a second round of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, aimed at resolving the ongoing conflict between the two nations, despite both sides remaining far apart on key issues. The previous Trump administration was eager to bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table, but has been showing signs of frustration over the process. The US role so far in the negotiations has been described as "relatively weak" and cautions that if the administration were to walk away from the talks "it would fundamentally shift the balance of power in the war to the Russian side." The talks occur amidst continued fighting and deep strikes by both sides into each other's territories, diminishing hopes for a significant breakthrough. </p>

          <p>Princess Catherine Duleep Singh, a British-born Sikh princess, defied social norms by living openly in a same-sex relationship in early 1900s Germany and using her privilege to help Jewish families escape Nazi persecution. She provided financial support, wrote letters of recommendation, and guaranteed immigration documents, and even hosted refugees in her home in England. Her efforts were largely unacknowledged during her lifetime, but have recently come to light through the work of biographers and the stories of those she saved. Singh's legacy is now being embraced by LGBTQ+ communities as an icon for fearlessly living and loving as she chose.</p>

          <p>Eight people were hospitalized in Boulder, Colorado, after a suspect allegedly used a "makeshift flamethrower" and threw an incendiary device at a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators during a Run for Their Lives walk. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was allegedly heard yelling "Free Palestine" during the attack. The FBI is investigating the incident as a "targeted terror attack" motivated by ideology, while local officials and community leaders have condemned the act as antisemitic and hateful.

          <p>The United States' defense sector relies heavily on China for critical minerals essential for advanced weapon systems, raising concerns about military readiness and supply chain security as Beijing tightens export restrictions.

Recent export controls imposed by China on gallium, germanium, antimony, and rare earth elements are affecting American military end users, highlighting the vulnerability of the U.S. defense industry to Chinese trade policies.</p>

          <p>China has criticized U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for his remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore, accusing him of espousing a "Cold War mentality" and vilifying China as a threat in the Indo-Pacific region. The Chinese Foreign Ministry stated that Hegseth's speech was filled with provocations intended to sow discord, and falsely labeled China as a threat. Hegseth had stated that the U.S. would bolster its defenses overseas to counter China's rapidly developing military threats, particularly towards Taiwan, and insisted that allies in the Indo-Pacific contribute more to their own defense.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Family Dynamic" by Susan Dominus, explores how sibling relationships, including birth order and achievements, affect a personâ€™s life trajectory. Research suggests eldest children may perform better on cognitive tests due to increased parental attention, but sibling influence extends beyond birth order. Siblings can spur each other to pursue different fields and act as mirrors, reflecting both positive and negative traits. While sibling dynamics can be complex and sometimes challenging, they provide a unique opportunity for self-reflection and growth.</p>

          <p>Despite former President Trump's promises to quickly broker peace in Ukraine, progress remains elusive four months into his second term, as Russia and Ukraine remain entrenched in their positions. Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress, hinting at a potential withdrawal of U.S. involvement if the two leaders can't make headway soon. While some analysts caution that such a move could shift the balance of power in favor of Russia, others suggest that reduced presidential engagement might not be detrimental if working-level officials continue negotiations and support. Despite efforts to secure ceasefires and prisoner exchanges, significant challenges remain in achieving a lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize the country's flight paths, many of which were established around 70 years ago, to potentially speed up flights and reduce delays for passengers. The initial phase of the shake-up will focus on redesigning the complex airspace in and around London through the creation of the UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS). However, some community groups have warned that the new flight paths could lead to increased noise pollution over previously unaffected residential areas. The government says the changes will make air travel more efficient for all.</p>

A study found that 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits are located within a mile of schools in the state, potentially exposing approximately 29,500 students to unhealthy emissions. Researchers have linked air pollution from fossil fuels to decreased student test scores and increased absences, highlighting the need for greater regulation and monitoring of air quality near schools.

The Assad regime had consistently denied knowing of Tice's whereabouts, but the BBC investigation proves this was false. The information is the first evidence to surface of the Syrian regime's detention of Mr Tice since search efforts began to find him following the fall of Bashar al-Assad in early December 2024.</p>

          <p>USC's baseball team suffered a 14-1 defeat to Oregon State in the NCAA Corvallis Regional final, forcing a winner-take-all rematch. USC's aggressive strategy backfired early, allowing Oregon State to gain momentum and dominate the game. Despite loading the bases in the fifth inning, USC failed to capitalize, while Oregon State capitalized on USC's bullpen. USC will have an opportunity for redemption in Monday's regional final, but will need to overcome Oregon State's strong performance.</p>

The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was endorsed by President Trump. Nawrocki's victory could hinder Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system, potentially leading to political instability. Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine, promising to continue Poland's support but criticizing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to hold a press conference on June 9 to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association. Multiple association sources said the Mongolian-born 40-year-old, now known as elder Miyagino, will leave the ancient sport's governing body amid uncertainty about the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers.
