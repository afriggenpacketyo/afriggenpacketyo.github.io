          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year.

          <p>Paramount Global is facing significant backlash for its decision to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. Critics, including press freedom advocates and a federal commissioner, have labeled the move a "shameful capitulation" that could embolden attacks on journalists. While Paramount stated the settlement avoids legal uncertainty, some senators are calling for an investigation, suggesting it could be seen as an attempt to gain regulatory approval for a pending merger.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced plans to lay off approximately 9,000 employees, its largest round of cuts this year, in a move aimed at driving efficiencies and leveraging new technologies. While the company's reasoning could imply a role for artificial intelligence, some analysts believe the primary driver is careful cost management to balance heavy investments in data centers. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria notes that productivity gains from AI do make it easier for the company to reduce its workforce while maintaining output. (not investment advice)</p>

Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing an expedition to the island in November to investigate the object and other signs, such as American-made tools, that suggest Earhart and her navigator may have crash-landed there.</p>
