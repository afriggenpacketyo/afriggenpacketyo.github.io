          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration and assessing citizenship status before providing voter registration forms through public assistance programs. The judge stated that the Constitution grants Congress and the states, not the President, the authority to regulate federal elections. This ruling follows lawsuits challenging Trump's executive order on election integrity, with the judge noting that the Department of Justice offered little defense of the order. The decision underscores the separation of powers and the limitations of executive authority in shaping election processes.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that the U.S. and China were actively engaged in trade discussions, but China refuted this claim, labeling it "fake news." Trump later reaffirmed his stance, stating that representatives from both countries had met recently, though he declined to disclose their identities. This disagreement occurs amidst heightened trade tensions, with Trump imposing significant tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Experts suggest that China believes it has the upper hand in the trade standoff, given Trump's vulnerability to economic pressures. Optimism remains low given the conflicting accounts and escalating trade war.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's governor, Andrew Bailey, warned that the UK economy faces a "growth shock" because of President Trump's trade policies. The IMF downgraded its 2025 growth forecast for the UK, reflecting concerns about the impact of tariffs on global trade. While the UK government seeks a trade agreement with the U.S., it remains cautious about compromising on food standards and regulations. The Bank of England must now balance the risks to growth against rising inflation expectations amidst the uncertainty of the global trade environment.</p>

          <p>In a rare public critique of Moscow, President Trump told Vladimir Putin to "STOP!" after a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv resulted in at least 12 deaths and 90 injuries.

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in March fell 5.9% to their slowest pace since 2009, indicating a weak start to the spring housing market. Higher mortgage rates and economic concerns are contributing factors. Despite an increase in available listings, affordability challenges persist. The decline in sales raises concerns about reduced economic mobility, as people are less able to trade up to nicer homes.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, recently revealed that the added electricity costs from people saying "please" and "thank you" to chatbots amount to tens of millions of dollars. Every interaction with a chatbot costs money and energy, and additional words increase the server's workload. While it may seem trivial, the cumulative impact of politeness in AI interactions is substantial, raising questions about the economics of AI usage.</p>

She says, “This happened [to me] for a reason and I'm going to make the most of it to spread awareness because there's never enough awareness". The ALS Society of Canada says the average financial burden a household incurs with a member living with ALS between $150,000 and $250,000 over the course of the disease. It's considered the "bankruptcy disease" because the yearly cost of ALS care is much higher than that for people living with HIV/AIDS, stroke survivors in their first year, or those with Alzheimer’s.</p>
