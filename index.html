          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index increased by 0.1% in May, falling short of economists' expectations, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4%. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also showed a smaller increase than anticipated, raising concerns among Federal Reserve officials about the impact of tariffs on inflation. Energy prices declined, offsetting increases in food and shelter costs, while vehicle and apparel prices also decreased. Despite the modest inflation figures, some economists caution that the full impact of tariffs may not be reflected in the CPI data for several months. (not investment advice)</p>

Factors such as inflation remaining above the 2% target and the economy's continued strength suggest the Fed will likely hold rates steady. While HELOC rates are closely tied to the Prime Rate and may decrease with Fed rate cuts, home equity loan rates are more connected to the bond market and broader economic conditions, suggesting stability.

          <h2>Inflation Holds Steady Amidst Delayed Impact of Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Inflation remained relatively stable in May, with consumer prices rising 2.4% from a year ago, according to a Labor Department report. While President Trump's tariffs may have contributed to rising prices for some goods, their overall impact has yet to be fully felt. Falling gasoline prices offset rising costs for rent and groceries, but Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that tariffs could reverse progress made on inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady amid concerns about the potential inflationary effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
