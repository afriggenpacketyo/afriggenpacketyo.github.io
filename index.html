          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 16:23:01 EDT</div>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. This common circulatory condition, which affects blood flow in leg veins, was described as benign and typical for individuals over 70. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing the president with swollen ankles and bruised hands. Medical examinations ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and officials stated the hand bruising was a benign side effect of aspirin use and frequent handshaking.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2025, exceeding analysts' earnings and revenue forecasts. The company's revenue grew by 16% year-over-year to $11.08 billion, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue guidance, citing healthy member growth, increased advertising sales, and a weaker U.S. dollar. This marks the second quarter that the streaming giant will not release specific subscriber data. The positive performance was attributed to a combination of more members, higher subscription prices, and growing ad revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House is forcefully pushing back against criticism regarding its handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling Democrats' calls for transparency an "asinine suggestion." The administration is facing pressure from both Republicans and Democrats to release more information, but has stated the Justice Department found no evidence of blackmail lists. President Trump has dismissed the controversy as a "hoax" orchestrated by Democrats, while asserting that Attorney General Pam Bondi will release any credible information.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed that a significant data breach compromised the personal information of over 100 British officials, including special forces and MI6 members, alongside nearly 19,000 Afghans who had sought resettlement. The leak, which occurred in 2022 but was discovered in 2023, placed many Afghans at severe risk of reprisal from the Taliban. Details of the breach were initially suppressed by a court injunction. The government has since established a covert resettlement program for those affected, acknowledging the incident as a "serious departmental error."</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Classifying Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster to Unlock Federal Aid</h2>

          <p>Following a record-breaking heat dome in June, a group of bipartisan lawmakers is proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow state and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, which currently do not qualify for such aid. Proponents argue the move is critical, as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, and funding could support cooling centers and heat adaptation projects. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that existing hazard mitigation grants can already address these needs without new legislation.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended Diane Abbott, the longest-serving female MP, following an investigation into comments she made about racism. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated controversial views she had previously expressed, suggesting that prejudice against Jewish and Traveller people is not the same as racism based on skin color because it is not always visible. This stance, which she had previously apologized for, was criticized by the party's leadership. Abbott will now sit as an independent MP pending the outcome of the party's investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>An Iranian citizen and chiropractor, Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside his child's preschool in Beaverton, Oregon. According to ICE, Khanbabazadeh had overstayed his visa, and he resisted arrest after being allowed to drop off his child. An immigration attorney stated the man was married to a U.S. citizen and had already applied for a green card. The arrest, which took place at a "sensitive location," reflects a policy change under the Trump administration and has been criticized by witnesses and community members.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly finalized an agreement allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to access the vast national Medicaid database. This data-sharing arrangement, intended to help ICE locate immigrants, gives the agency access to personal information of 79 million low-income Americans, including addresses and social security numbers. Critics and privacy advocates have condemned the move as a "weaponization of data" and a betrayal of trust, warning it could deter people, including citizens and eligible immigrants, from seeking necessary medical care. The administration defended the action as a measure to prevent fraud and abuse by ineligible individuals.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent military escalation in Syria, including strikes on Damascus, is viewed by analysts as part of a strategy to exploit internal unrest and maintain a weak Syrian state. While Israel officially stated its actions were to protect the Druze minority during sectarian clashes, experts suggest the broader objectives are to carve out an informal buffer zone in southern Syria and prevent the new government from consolidating power. The timing of the strikes also coincides with domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This aggressive posture risks further destabilizing the fragile country and the wider region.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko expressed skepticism about President Trump's 50-day peace deadline for Russia, arguing it gives Moscow time to regroup and kill more civilians. Klitschko asserted that Vladimir Putin "only understands the language of force" and urged Western partners to use the time to supply more modern weapons and impose tougher sanctions. He highlighted the constant threat to Ukrainian cities from massive Russian attacks and the urgent need for more air defense systems. The mayor emphasized that while Ukraine hopes for a diplomatic solution, ceding territory is not an acceptable compromise.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a proposed $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit over its Peacock streaming service. The lawsuit alleged that Peacock violated consumer protection laws by not clearly disclosing its automatic renewal terms and by making it difficult for subscribers to cancel the service. Under the settlement, Peacock must make its renewal and cancellation policies more transparent and user-friendly. The payment includes civil penalties and funds to support future consumer protection enforcement by the county.</p>
