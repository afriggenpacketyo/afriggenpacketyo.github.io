          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, formed on Sunday off Mexico's Atlantic and Pacific coasts, respectively, threatening the region with several days of heavy rainfall. Tropical Storm Barry is projected to make landfall in southeastern Mexico, bringing high winds and up to 10 inches of rain in some areas, prompting tropical storm warnings. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Flossie is strengthening in the Pacific and is expected to become a hurricane, though forecasters anticipate it will remain offshore. The storms mark an active period in both the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has significantly limited the ability of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a tool frequently used to block President Trump's policies. The administration highlighted that just five liberal-leaning district courts were responsible for the vast majority of the 40 universal injunctions issued against its agenda. This 6-3 ruling is being hailed by the administration as a major victory against what it termed "judicial overreach" that hampered executive authority. The decision addresses a dramatic increase in such injunctions, which far surpassed those faced by previous administrations combined.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The threat was a direct response to Tillis's opposition to parts of the president's major tax and spending bill. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and independent thinking in Washington, stating it has become an "endangered species." His retirement opens up a key Senate seat in a state that has reliably voted Republican in recent presidential elections, setting the stage for a competitive race.</p>

          <p>Over the past year, insiders at artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia have sold more than $1 billion worth of company stock, with approximately half of those sales occurring in the last month alone. The sell-off coincides with the stock reaching new highs, having surged significantly despite concerns about international sales restrictions. CEO Jensen Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares. The substantial insider selling comes as Nvidia briefly regained its position as the world's most valuable company amid a strong market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite some policy efforts across multiple administrations, progress has been slow, leaving the U.S. susceptible to economic and geopolitical leverage.

          <p>A group of teenagers in Atlanta, known as the "water boys" for selling bottled water to drivers, are allegedly exploiting payment apps to scam customers out of large sums of money. Several victims have reported significant losses, with one losing $1,100 after handing her phone to a seller to complete a $2 transaction on Cash App. Another victim lost $800 after scanning a QR code. The incidents, which have escalated to include armed robbery and car theft, highlight a growing trend of digital payment scams. Authorities and experts are warning the public to be cautious and never hand their phones to sellers.</p>

          <p>The current season of "Love Island USA" has become its most-watched yet, but its popularity is accompanied by intense cyberbullying directed at contestants. The harassment has become so severe that the show recently aired a statement pleading with viewers to stop, a sentiment echoed by host Ariana Madix. This dark side of reality TV fame mirrors the tragic history of the original UK franchise, which saw contestant suicides following relentless public scrutiny. While producers have implemented more robust mental health support systems over the years, experts note the ongoing challenge of protecting participants from the negative impacts of overnight fame.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The nomination of Zohran Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, as the Democratic candidate for New York City mayor highlights a significant ideological shift within the party. Mamdani's victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who made support for Israel a central issue, shows that a pro-Palestinian stance is no longer a disqualifier in a city with the largest Jewish population outside Israel. The result reflects a growing divide, particularly among younger and more progressive voters, over Israel's actions in Gaza. While some view it as a rejection of weaponizing antisemitism, others in the Jewish community express fear over safety and waning political influence.</p>

          <p>An early-summer heatwave is scorching Europe, with temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and breaking records. In Spain, the town of El Granado recorded a new national June high of 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities, including Rome and Venice, on high alert. The extreme heat is expected to persist, with London predicted to hit 35Â°C. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these early heatwaves to human-driven climate change. The heat is also impacting wildlife, with animal protection groups in France reporting that their centers are overwhelmed with birds suffering from the high temperatures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions to prevent heat-related illnesses, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise in hot weather than from being left in cars. Since dogs cannot sweat effectively, their body temperature can rise dangerously fast. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, suggesting instead early morning or late evening walks. A simple test is to place the back of your hand on the pavement; if it's too hot for you, it's too hot for your dog's paws.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment activities in "a matter of months" following recent U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities. In an interview, Grossi noted that while the attacks caused severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. This assessment contrasts with President Trump's claim that the facilities were "totally obliterated." Grossi emphasized the possibility that Iran may have moved some of its nearly 900-pound stockpile of highly enriched uranium before the attack, underscoring the need for renewed inspections.</p>

Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV, but her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case was marked by a hung jury in the first trial, intense media coverage fueled by bloggers, and an internal investigation into the lead state police trooper. After a second trial, a jury found Read not guilty of murder and manslaughter but convicted her of driving under the influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that could disrupt the global AI market. This decision puts Baidu in direct competition with both proprietary models from companies like OpenAI and other open-source leaders like DeepSeek. Analysts suggest the move could drastically lower costs for developers, with some calling it a "declaration of war on pricing" as Baidu claims its models offer comparable performance at a fraction of the cost. The development pressures closed-source providers to justify their pricing and raises the bar for the entire industry. (not investment advice)</p>

In a Fox News interview, Trump suggested his administration could prosecute reporters and their sources if they do not comply with demands to identify who leaked the classified analysis. The report, published by outlets like CNN and The New York Times, indicated the strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by months, not years as the White House claimed.
