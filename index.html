          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman publicly explained their recent dissent against the decision to hold interest rates steady. Both officials argued that the central bank's "wait and see" approach is overly cautious and risks harming the labor market and overall economic growth. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that gradual rate cuts are necessary to avoid falling behind the curve, representing a notable public disagreement within the Fed's leadership.

          <p>President Trump has intensified his criticism of the Federal Reserve, calling Chair Jerome Powell a "stubborn MORON" and urging the board to take control if interest rates are not cut. In separate developments, a group of 22 members of Congress has called for the resignation of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, accusing her of spreading partisan propaganda. Trump also commented on the war in Ukraine, calling Russia's actions a "disgrace" and confirming sanctions would be imposed if a ceasefire is not met.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has indicated he may call a special election in November to potentially redraw the state's congressional district maps. This move is a direct response to efforts in Republican-led states, like Texas, to remap their districts to favor the GOP in upcoming elections. To proceed, California voters would first need to approve changes to the state's independent redistricting commission, which was established to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Newsom framed the potential action as a necessary response to "fight fire with fire."</p>

His departure follows the revelation of a massive data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 people, including British spies, soldiers, and Afghan allies seeking refuge. The leak, which occurred in 2022, is considered one of the worst in recent UK history and has prompted a major restructuring within the department.

          <p>President Trump announced that he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be moved to "appropriate regions" as a precautionary measure. The action was taken in response to what he described as "highly provocative statements" from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, had made comments regarding Moscow's nuclear strike capabilities. Trump stated that words can have unintended consequences and that he hopes this move will serve as a deterrent.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn following President Trump's announcement of new "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous countries. Major digital assets like ether and XRP saw declines, and the move triggered significant liquidations of long positions, further pushing prices down. The new tariffs have renewed fears about inflation and the Federal Reserve's ability to cut interest rates, causing investors to pull back from speculative assets like crypto. Crypto-linked stocks such as Coinbase and MicroStrategy also suffered notable losses. (not investment advice)</p>

The movie, directed by Akiva Schaffer, prioritizes a high joke-per-minute ratio over a coherent plot, providing a refreshing dose of goofy, ensemble-driven comedy.

          <p>The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has removed all references to Donald Trump's two impeachments from its exhibit on presidential power. Museum officials replaced the contemporary signage with an older version from 2008, which now only includes a generic reference to presidents facing removal from office. The move, which a spokesperson said was part of a content review, has drawn criticism as it comes amid a broader campaign by the Trump administration to reshape federal cultural institutions and purge what it deems "anti-American ideology."</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, is suing the Trump administration over an executive order aimed at ending gender-affirming care for minors. The lawsuit argues the order is an unconstitutional attack on patients, providers, and states' rights. It challenges the administration's directive to the Justice Department to investigate and potentially prosecute healthcare providers, which has already created a chilling effect and led to clinic closures. The states are asking a federal court to vacate the order.</p>

          <p>A new Department of Energy report, intended to justify rolling back climate regulations, has been widely condemned by climate scientists as being full of misinformation and "pseudoscience." The report was released alongside an EPA proposal to undo the 2009 "endangerment finding," the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases. Esteemed scientists argue the report cherry-picks data, uses long-debunked talking points, and was crafted by a handpicked group of authors with fringe views to promote a pro-fossil fuel agenda, ignoring the overwhelming scientific consensus.</p>

The move has caused shock and anger across the country, as it was far worse than the anticipated rate and came after Swiss officials believed they were close to a more favorable deal. The punitive tariff is reportedly linked to the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland. Swiss businesses are now warning of potential job losses as the government scrambles to negotiate before the tariffs take effect.</p>
