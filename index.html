          <p>Former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams has publicly criticized the decision by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel nearly $500 million in mRNA vaccine research. Adams argued that this move undermines what he considers one of former President Trump's greatest achievements, Operation Warp Speed, and will halt progress in fighting diseases from COVID-19 to cancer. He warned that abandoning this promising technology, which he credits with saving millions of lives, is a dangerous step and that "people are going to die" as a direct result of the funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrencies are experiencing a surge in acceptance within Washington and Wall Street, spurred by the Trump administration's supportive stance, including the signing of the Genius Act. This shift has prompted Congress to consider new regulatory frameworks for the industry, which has significantly increased its lobbying efforts. However, former SEC officials express grave concerns, comparing the speculative nature of crypto to the conditions preceding the 2008 financial crisis. They warn that current legislative proposals are largely shaped by the industry itself, potentially leaving consumers vulnerable to high volatility and scams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have initiated a murder inquiry after a man was found dead in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the death. Authorities suspect the case may be linked to a separate, serious assault that occurred earlier the same day, where a priest, Fr. John Murray, was attacked with a bottle inside St. Patrick's Church. The priest was hospitalized in serious condition, and the two violent events have left the local community in shock.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London supporting the recently banned group Palestine Action resulted in 532 arrests, marking one of the largest single-day arrest totals by the Metropolitan Police in a decade. The majority were arrested for displaying placards in support of the organization, which the government proscribed as a terrorist group in July. The move has sparked a debate over civil liberties, with human rights groups like Amnesty International criticizing the broad application of terrorism laws, while the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice regarding the group's activities.</p>

The child sustained a non-life-threatening injury to her hand, while the other victims, ranging in age from 23 to 52, are also expected to survive. Police are currently investigating the motive and have not yet released information about a suspect in the attack.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Alaska to discuss a path toward ending the war in Ukraine. The summit comes after Trump set a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, threatening further sanctions. The meeting, however, will not initially include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has stated that any decisions made without Kyiv's involvement will be "dead decisions." The Trump administration has reportedly floated a deal involving territorial swaps, a concept that Ukraine has firmly rejected as unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Southern Brave secured a dominant nine-wicket victory over Birmingham Phoenix in the men's Hundred competition, largely thanks to a formidable bowling performance.

In response, Brave's batsmen James Vince and Leus du Plooy led a confident chase, reaching the target with 19 balls to spare.

Research supports the idea that spending time in green spaces can have significant mental health benefits. Experts suggest that the practice can be as simple as spending 15 minutes in a local park or backyard, encouraging a slower, more present state of being.</p>

          <p>A new biographical analysis of novelist Muriel Spark argues that her reputation as a witty, comic writer often overshadows her profound identity as a religious author. The article posits that Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954 was the most significant influence on her work, particularly her fascination with the Book of Job. Her novels frequently explore themes of divine judgment, free will, and the nature of truth through narrative structure rather than explicit discussion. By controlling the narrative with an omniscient, sometimes capricious, voice, she mirrors the relationship between God and humanity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's announcement of a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has created apprehension among Ukrainian and European allies. They fear that in his pursuit of a deal to end the war, Trump might make concessions that undermine Ukraine's sovereignty, such as legitimizing Russian territorial gains. The meeting was arranged after Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, engaged in back-channel discussions, and it currently excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Putin's request. Zelensky has condemned the idea that Ukraine's future could be decided without its participation, calling such potential outcomes "decisions against peace."</p>

          <p>Severe storms with gusts exceeding 80 mph tore through eastern Nebraska, causing one death and significant damage. A woman was killed in Two Rivers state park when a large tree fell on her vehicle, and a man with her was critically injured. The powerful winds also damaged two housing units at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, forcing the displacement of 387 inmates to other facilities. Widespread power outages were reported across the region as the storm toppled trees and power lines, part of a larger system affecting the Midwest.</p>

          <p>In response to a rise in AI-powered cyberattacks, corporations are now drafting AI agents into their own defense forces. These autonomous AI systems are being used to automate routine security tasks, detect threats, analyze incidents, and free up human cybersecurity professionals for more strategic work. Companies like ReliaQuest are developing role-based "agentic teammates" that can handle tasks like monitoring executive travel or investigating low-level alerts. While still in early stages, the adoption of defensive AI is seen as essential for keeping pace with the evolving threat landscape created by malicious actors using the same technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," delves into the literary trope of strange and mystical sisters. Set in 18th-century England, the book follows five sisters who are accused of witchcraft and transforming into dogs, triggering fear and persecution in their village. The article analyzes how the novel uses this premise to explore historical anxieties surrounding femininity, bodily autonomy, and societal conformity. While acknowledging the story engages with familiar themes, the review praises its lush, violent prose and its direct confrontation with why groups of women are often perceived as a collective menace.</p>

          <p>A coalition of key European nations, including the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement reinforcing their support for Ukraine ahead of the planned meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. The leaders stressed that any path to peace "cannot be decided without Ukraine" and that meaningful negotiations must respect its sovereignty and borders. The statement comes as the White House confirmed it is open to including President Zelenskyy in the talks, though the summit currently remains bilateral at Putin's request. Zelenskyy has been firm that a peace deal excluding Ukraine is unacceptable.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a remarkable 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Although the kick will not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, it demonstrated his exceptional leg strength and potential as a long-range weapon. The current NFL record is a 66-yard field goal by Baltimore's Justin Tucker. Little's successful attempt, which appeared to have cleared the crossbar with room to spare, caused a massive celebration among his teammates on the sideline.</p>

These companies anticipate further growth as the Department of Homeland Security receives a massive cash infusion to expand its detention network. (not investment advice)</p>

Tasmanian police have since charged two 14-year-old girls in connection with the incident.
