          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a significant legislative package central to the Trump administration's agenda. Speaker Mike Johnson championed the bill, framing it as a pivotal moment that delivers on Republican promises and improves American lives, contrasting it with what he called Democratic "performances." The bill, referred to as the "big, beautiful bill," is now expected to be signed into law by the president.

          <p>Umar Kremlev, President of the International Boxing Association (IBA), is calling for Algerian boxer Imane Khelif to be stripped of her Olympic gold medal. The demand follows a prolonged controversy over Khelif's gender eligibility, as she was previously disqualified by the IBA for failing a gender test, which the IOC later dismissed as "arbitrary." The IBA, which the IOC has derecognized, maintains its stance, while the IOC and its newly recognized governing body, World Boxing, are implementing new gender eligibility policies.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is planning to cut nearly 75% of its staff in the Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A), reducing its workforce from about 1,000 to 275 employees. The move, intended to eliminate redundancies, has sparked alarm among lawmakers and law enforcement agencies who warn it could create dangerous security gaps. Critics argue that weakening I&A, the only intelligence agency mandated to share threat information with state and local partners, is reckless amid a heightened threat environment.

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, the initial monthly payments for a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) are currently almost identical due to similar average interest rates.

In contrast, HELOCs have variable rates that fluctuate with market conditions, which can lead to cheaper or more expensive payments over time.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a nearly hour-long phone call to discuss the war in Ukraine. According to a Kremlin official, Trump raised the issue of an immediate ceasefire, while Putin stated a focus on a "political resolution." The call followed a decision by the U.S. to halt some missile and ammunition shipments to Ukraine, a move ordered by the Defense Secretary pending a review of U.S. stockpiles. This development has fueled concern among some, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, about the U.S. commitment to supporting Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will take up cases from West Virginia and Idaho concerning state laws that prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports. Lower courts had previously blocked these laws, ruling they violated either the Constitution's equal protection clause or Title IX. This decision follows a recent ruling where the court upheld bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The cases will be argued in the court's next term, setting the stage for a landmark decision on transgender rights in school sports.</p>

However, analysts are skeptical about the prospects for success, citing the deep-seated and ongoing conflicts, such as the dispute over the Golan Heights with Syria and Hezbollah's presence in Lebanon. While the U.S. may be motivated by a desire to secure a major diplomatic win, experts suggest that President Trump's approach may oversimplify complex realities.

          <p>This article argues that the Republican repeal of clean-energy tax credits within their major legislative bill is a counterproductive policy that could trigger an energy affordability crisis. The author contends that with U.S. electricity demand soaring, renewable sources like wind and solar are the cheapest and fastest way to increase supply and stabilize prices. Repealing the credits will make these projects more expensive, slowing their development and likely leading to higher energy bills, particularly in Republican-leaning states. The piece suggests the move is driven more by partisan animosity than by sound economic policy.</p>

          <p>Cloud provider CoreWeave is the first company to commercially deploy systems built with Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell Ultra AI chips. The deployment of the powerful, liquid-cooled systems is a significant milestone for Nvidia, demonstrating its ability to deliver its latest technology to market promptly. It is also a major win for CoreWeave, which differentiates itself from larger cloud competitors like Amazon and Google by offering cutting-edge hardware first. CoreWeave, which has a close relationship with Nvidia, has seen its stock price rise significantly since its IPO earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The UK government has outlined a 10-year plan to reform the NHS in England, focusing on shifting care from hospitals to new neighborhood health centers and emphasizing prevention. Key proposals include creating up to 300 local health hubs, launching an "ambitious moonshot" to combat obesity with digital incentives, and expanding access to dental care. The plan also calls for better use of technology, such as the NHS app, to create a "doctor in your pocket." While the government calls it a last chance to save the service, critics question the funding and staffing for the initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Labour government in the UK plans to further curtail the "Right to Buy" scheme, which allows social housing tenants to purchase their homes at a discount. Under the new plans, newly built social housing will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants must live in their properties for at least ten years to qualify, up from three. The government stated the changes will help protect social housing stock and allow councils to build new homes. The Conservative opposition criticized the move as an "attack on aspiration," highlighting the policy's contentious political nature.</p>

          <p>The Isle of Wight rock band Wet Leg is returning with their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," which marks a significant evolution in their sound and style. In an interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discusses the band's meteoric rise and how their new music is more sonically expressive and raw, reflecting their growth as touring musicians. The album's themes are heavily influenced by love, a departure from their debut, though it retains their signature tongue-in-cheek lyrical style. The band is excited to perform the new material, which they feel was made to be played live.</p>
