        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is making substantial early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, effectively sidelining U.S. farmers during their traditional peak export period. This strategic shift highlights Beijing's increasing trade reliance on South America amidst ongoing tensions with Washington. The move has locked in roughly half of China's projected demand from South American sources, placing downward pressure on U.S. soybean futures, which are already near five-year lows. This action shortens the critical sales window for American agricultural exporters who heavily depend on Chinese demand.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, a Wall Street strategist from Jefferies and a potential candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, is advocating for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argues that the Fed should not be deterred by recent inflation data and should instead cut rates by a half-percentage point to stimulate the labor market. This position aligns him with others on an expanding list of candidates who believe monetary policy is currently too restrictive. Zervos also stated that having more market-savvy individuals involved in policy decisions would be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced a plan to redraw the state's congressional maps in a direct response to a Republican effort in Texas to gerrymander districts in their favor. This move sets up a significant political battle that could influence the 2026 midterm elections and the balance of power in Congress. Newsom stated that California must "meet fire with fire" after Texas Republicans, reportedly at President Trump's urging, moved to make five Democratic-held seats more favorable to the GOP. The process in California is more complex, likely requiring a voter-approved constitutional amendment.</p>

This project, long frozen due to international pressure, would divide the West Bank and disconnect it from East Jerusalem, which Palestinians envision as their future capital. The announcement has drawn sharp condemnation from the U.S., UK, EU, and UN, who view settlements as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to peace.

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the U.S. has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in ten months, offering a glimmer of hope for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This decline comes ahead of any official interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The article suggests that future rate drops could be influenced by key upcoming economic data, including the September 5th unemployment report and the September 11th inflation figures. The next Federal Reserve meeting on September 17th is also highlighted as a critical date that could significantly impact the borrowing climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former correctional officer at a California women's prison, Gregory Rodriguez, has been sentenced to 224 years for the sexual abuse of nine incarcerated women. The case, which spanned nearly a decade, highlighted systemic issues of misconduct within the state's prison system, as Rodriguez coerced and assaulted victims under the threat of his authority. Survivors testified about the lifelong trauma and the failure of the system to protect them, while the U.S. Department of Justice has an ongoing civil rights investigation into the facility. The sentencing is a rare instance of a guard facing significant criminal penalties for such abuse.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic 1,700% surge since its 2020 public listing, driven largely by significant government contracts and strong interest from retail investors. The company recently reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, pushing its market valuation past $430 billion. U.S. government revenue, particularly from military contracts, grew 53% last quarter and accounts for over half of total revenue. Despite its astronomical growth, Palantir's valuation is at a steep premium compared to tech giants with far greater revenues, reflecting high investor expectations for its AI-powered software.

          <p>The annual Monterey Car Week auctions are underway with subdued expectations, as the classic car market faces a significant generational shift. Sales are projected to decline for the third consecutive year, with the high-end market for 1950s and 1960s cars appearing weakest as baby boomer collectors age out. In contrast, demand is soaring for newer supercars from the 1980s and beyond, favored by younger millennial and Gen Z collectors. This rotation in interest is reshaping the market, with fewer multi-million-dollar vintage cars and more focus on modern, usable exotics. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, author Rebecca Solnit argues that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is a hypocritical power grab based on false claims of rampant crime. She contrasts this action with the violence of January 6, 2021, which she notes was instigated by Trump himself and was the city's most violent day in modern history. The article posits that the move is part of a broader right-wing war on cities, which are seen as threatening centers of diversity and progressive values. Solnit suggests the D.C. intervention is a manufactured drama to distract from other issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and federal takeover of the D.C. police force is a move that would be legally and politically difficult to repeat in other U.S. cities. Because Washington, D.C. is a federal district and not a state, the president has unique authority over its National Guard and can assume control of its police in emergencies. In contrast, state governors command their own National Guard units, creating a significant barrier to federal intervention. Legal experts note that any attempt to deploy military forces for domestic policing in states would face strong opposition and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Yue Wa, one of the last traditional grocery markets in Los Angeles' Chinatown, is closing after 18 years, succumbing to a combination of pressures. Owner Amy Tran cites a series of burglaries, the economic impact of the pandemic, gentrification that has displaced the local community, and recent ICE raids that have instilled fear and reduced foot traffic. The market served as a vital source of affordable, fresh produce for the neighborhood's elderly and low-income residents. Its closure represents the loss of a community hub and a way of life in a rapidly changing historic enclave.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay from The Atlantic delves into the historical evolution of the concept of "genius," tracing its meaning from an innate personal spirit to a quantifiable, and often controversial, trait. The article examines 19th-century attempts to understand genius through heredity, highlighting the work of Francis Galton, who coined the term "eugenics" in his quest to classify human intellect. This scientific approach, rooted in racial and class biases, contrasts with earlier, more mystical definitions. The essay concludes that while intelligence is partly heritable, the making of a genius is profoundly influenced by luck, timing, and social conditions.</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that the death of 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz at a mental health hospital was an unlawful killing. Ruth, who was supposed to be under constant supervision, was left alone for 15 minutes by an inexperienced agency worker with false credentials, during which time she self-harmed and was later found unconscious. The failing hospital, which has since closed, was found to have insufficient staff training and provided unsuitable care. Her parents stated the system designed to keep their daughter safe had instead locked her away and harmed her.</p>
