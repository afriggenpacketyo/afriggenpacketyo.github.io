          <p>Officials in Pennsylvania have confirmed that the state is experiencing intermittent outages of its 911 emergency services system. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency acknowledged the issue, urging the public to call only for true emergencies and not to test the lines. In Philadelphia, police described the outage as sporadic, with some calls still connecting successfully. For instances where a call to 911 fails, authorities are advising residents to directly contact their local police district or non-emergency numbers to ensure they can reach emergency services when needed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of AI-integrated air combat capabilities, recently conducting a complex exercise involving crewed fighter jets and uncrewed XQ-58A Valkyrie drones. In the test, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15E each controlled two semi-autonomous drones, testing real-time coordination in a simulated combat environment. This "loyal wingman" concept, where drones fly alongside and are directed by crewed aircraft, is a key part of the U.S. strategy to maintain air supremacy. The advancements are seen as part of a technological race with China, which is also developing similar capabilities.</p>

          <p>South Carolina is set to honor Civil War hero Robert Smalls by erecting a statue of him on the State Capitol grounds, a significant historical milestone. Smalls, who was born into slavery, famously commandeered a Confederate ship and delivered it to the Union, later becoming a U.S. congressman. His will be the first statue of a Black person to be placed at the state's capitol, joining monuments that predominantly honor white men, many of whom have ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. The move represents a major step in acknowledging the diverse history of the state.</p>

          <p>Philanthropist Bill Gates has strongly condemned the Trump administration's decision to effectively dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), calling the effects of the funding cuts devastating but reversible. After USAID was absorbed into the State Department, reports have emerged of critical aid disruptions, including shortages of HIV medication for children in Africa. Gates, whose foundation has worked closely with USAID for years, warned that the abrupt rollbacks are a huge mistake and are already leading to preventable deaths. The administration has also signaled cuts to other global health initiatives like Gavi, the vaccine alliance.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if President Donald Trump proceeds with a threatened 50% tariff. Trump's threat is linked to his disapproval of the criminal trial of his political ally and former Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, matching the U.S. tariff rate. This development risks a trade war between the two largest economies in the Americas, with Trump using trade policy to directly influence another nation's judicial and political affairs.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, who played Superman in the 1990s TV series "Lois & Clark," has criticized the director of the new "Superman" film, James Gunn, for describing the hero's story as an immigrant experience. Gunn stated that Superman represents an immigrant who came from elsewhere and that the film's core message is about basic human kindness. Cain called the take "woke" and suggested it was an unnecessary political comment. He argued that while the "American way" is immigrant-friendly, it requires rules, and he believes Gunn's framing of the character will hurt the film at the box office.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features that harm children and teens. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok's platform is built to maximize engagement among young users, exposing them to more ads and prompting purchases. The judge ruled that the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, focusing on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. The case is one of several legal challenges by states targeting tech companies over child safety.</p>

Despite the controversies, he was remembered by the current commissioner as one of the most influential police leaders of recent decades. Lord Blair's career ended when he resigned after the newly elected mayor, Boris Johnson, indicated a lack of confidence in his leadership.</p>

The judge cited evidence of officers targeting clearly identifiable members of the press. The order protects journalists from being targeted unless they pose an imminent threat and prohibits police from obstructing them from their reporting duties.</p>

          <p>The increasing integration of generative AI in the corporate world is creating new obstacles for recent college graduates seeking entry-level jobs. Data shows a 15% decline in listings for such roles, while applications per job have surged, intensifying competition. Experts note that AI is automating many of the routine tasks traditionally assigned to new hires, forcing a redefinition of entry-level positions and the skills required. With unemployment for recent graduates already higher than the national average, there are growing concerns that AI is beginning to displace the least experienced workers in the white-collar labor market.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have filed a civil lawsuit against a prominent Georgia Republican, alleging he operated a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. The SEC complaint claims Brant Frost IV and his company, First Liberty Building and Loan, lied to investors about making high-interest loans, instead using new funds to pay earlier investors. Frost allegedly misappropriated over $19 million for personal use, including luxury items and political donations, while the company was insolvent.

The issue stems from owner John Textor's stake in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the competition. UEFA has ruled that both clubs cannot compete, and because Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, they get precedence. Palace argues Textor does not have decisive influence and missed a key deadline to restructure, a step Forest took to comply with the rules, making them the beneficiaries of Palace's situation.</p>
