          <p>U.S. officials have been informed that Israel is prepared to initiate an operation in Iran, leading the U.S. to anticipate potential retaliation against American sites in Iraq.

Despite the evacuation, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to meet with Iranian officials for nuclear program talks.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a Â£29 billion per year increase for the NHS in England, along with funding boosts for defense and housing, as part of the government's spending plans until the end of the decade. The Spending Review also allocated more money for artificial intelligence and transport projects, focusing on "renewing Britain." However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face cuts in day-to-day spending. The government hopes these investments will reassure voters after a challenging first year.</p>

The astronomers noted the star's size, brightness, and color, describing it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. This detailed account confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star. The discovery helps to narrow down the star's possible position and contributes to a better understanding of astronomical events from centuries ago.</p>

Protesters, representing a diverse coalition of Angelenos, feel their right to belong is under attack, leading to clashes with law enforcement and vandalism of government buildings.

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has dropped 16 points since March, according to a recent Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number fell from 78% to 62%. The decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Donald Trump over the president's spending bill. Despite the decrease, Musk remains popular among Republicans after his time running the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

The government aims to transform the public realm and boost economic potential through these long-term investments. However, this strategy contrasts with the current volatile political climate and the restlessness of an electorate feeling economically squeezed. The government hopes that voters will remain patient as the benefits of these investments take time to materialize.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. Researchers studied two 86 million-year-old skeletons and concluded they belonged to the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. This discovery provides insight into how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of features that were key to the tyrannosaurs' dominance, such as skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.</p>
