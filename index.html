          <p>President Trump has confirmed his intention to host a UFC mixed martial arts event on the White House grounds as part of the 2026 celebrations for America's 250th anniversary. The announcement was made during a speech in Iowa, where he specified it would be a "championship fight, full fight" for an audience of 20,000 to 25,000 people. Longtime UFC CEO Dana White, a close friend of the president, will be responsible for organizing the event. A White House press secretary confirmed that the president is "dead serious" about the idea, which builds on his long-standing relationship with the mixed martial arts organization.</p>

          <p>At a campaign-style rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his signature tax and spending bill, calling it a birthday present for America. He also announced several plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026, including a UFC championship fight to be held on the White House grounds for up to 25,000 spectators. During the speech, Trump repeated claims of a stolen election and criticized the media, turning a potentially unifying event into a divisive rally. He also signaled a policy shift, suggesting he might allow migrant farm laborers to remain in the U.S.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The regulator accused the firm of engaging in a widespread, manipulative scheme to artificially influence India's benchmark Nifty 50 and BANKNIFTY indices for profit. SEBI alleges Jane Street used large, coordinated trades in stocks and futures to move the indices, allowing them to profit from much larger bets in the options market. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to regulatory compliance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian hearing implant manufacturer Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the launch. The device, which bypasses damaged inner ear hair cells to directly stimulate the auditory nerve, is designed for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss for whom traditional hearing aids are no longer effective. The launch took place through special economic zones in Hainan province and Hong Kong, signaling a rapid entry into the significant Chinese market. The system features an external processor with noise-cancelling microphone technology to improve user experience.</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The charges stemmed from an incident in October 2021 at a lake house party where McLemore sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman who was incapacitated from alcohol consumption. Prosecutors argued the woman was unable to consent, presenting evidence of her condition, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The district attorney emphasized that celebrity status does not grant immunity from prosecution in Clackamas County. McLemore's sentencing is scheduled for the following week.</p>

Critics on social media panned the idea as undignified and beneath the office of the presidency, with many comparing it to the dystopian satire film "Idiocracy."

          <p>An infant in Victorville, California, sustained head injuries after being dropped by its mother, who was struck by a car being moved by her 12-year-old child. The mother had allowed the 12-year-old to move the family vehicle in an apartment complex parking lot while she watched, holding the baby. As the tween was parking, the car door reportedly slammed into the mother, causing her to fall and drop the infant. The baby was airlifted to a medical center for treatment. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident as potential child cruelty, but has not confirmed if charges will be filed.</p>

          <p>Veterans, military families, and legal experts are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of troops to Los Angeles to handle protests threatens democratic norms and misuses military personnel. Speakers at a virtual news conference argued that using active-duty Marines and National Guard troops for civilian law enforcement-related tasks blurs a critical line established by the Posse Comitatus Act. They contend that troops are not trained for such missions, which pits them against American citizens and places them in an environment that increases the risk of excessive force. The deployment is seen by critics as an unnecessary and provocative militarization of domestic issues.</p>

          <p>New data reveals that immigrants with no criminal convictions represent the fastest-growing segment of the population in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. According to the Deportation Data Project, the number of detainees without a criminal record has nearly doubled since May, now accounting for about half of the at least 56,000 people being held. This trend contradicts administration claims that the focus of its mass deportation campaign is on violent criminals. The data suggests a significant shift in enforcement, with an increasing number of long-term residents with no criminal history being arrested and detained for deportation.</p>

Chilean authorities stopped Ethan Guo, who has over a million online followers, for allegedly submitting a false flight plan and deviating from it, which activated air safety alerts. He has been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code after landing on the island, which is claimed by Chile. Guo is hoping to become the first pilot to complete solo flights across all seven continents in his Cessna aircraft while raising money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, Northern California, has left seven people unaccounted for, according to officials. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics in the community of Esparto sparked a large fire that spread to surrounding grasslands, burning approximately 80 acres. Two people were confirmed injured, and a one-mile evacuation zone remains in effect due to the ongoing risk from un-detonated fireworks. Local records indicate the facility was operating without the proper local licenses to store commercial fireworks on the agricultural property. Federal authorities have been called to assist in the investigation.</p>

With plans to release its next-generation HBM4 chips in 2026, the company is positioned to capitalize on a market projected to grow significantly.

Van Orden posted a simple "YES!" in response to a message detailing that millions of Americans would lose health insurance and food assistance under the legislation. He later removed the post, claiming it was an error and that he intended to reply to a different White House statement. Critics remained skeptical, suggesting he deleted the post due to its openly cruel appearance, undercutting Republican efforts to downplay the bill's painful consequences.</p>

          <p>Advocates and local officials are raising alarms about public safety at U.S. national parks this summer due to significant staffing shortages. At Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland, for example, lifeguard towers are shuttered, leaving beaches unguarded during peak season. According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since January 2025, a result of administration-led budget cuts and a federal hiring freeze. Critics argue this lack of personnel, including lifeguards and other seasonal staff, puts millions of visitors at risk and is a direct consequence of chaotic agency management.</p>
