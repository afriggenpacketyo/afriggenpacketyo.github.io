        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his passing at age 91, industry experts are reflecting on Giorgio Armani's dual legacy as both a revolutionary fashion designer and a masterful business leader who built a multi-billion dollar global empire. Armani was celebrated for maintaining strict creative control over his brand, ensuring a consistent vision of sophisticated, accessible luxury across all his ventures, from haute couture to home goods. He famously redefined professional attire with his creation of the softly tailored "power suit" for men and later, the pantsuit for women, which empowered a new generation of professionals. His strategic use of Hollywood celebrity endorsements, starting with Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," further cemented his brand's iconic status.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams is scheduled to make a significant campaign announcement, fueling speculation about his political future. This comes after reports that advisors to President Donald Trump are considering nominating Adams for the U.S. ambassador position to Saudi Arabia. Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent after facing low approval ratings and a now-dropped federal indictment, could alter the mayoral race dynamics if he withdraws. His exit might consolidate the opposition against the Democratic front-runner, Zohran Mamdani, although Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa has stated he will remain in the contest regardless.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War, a title it held prior to the post-World War II era. The order allows the new name to be used in official correspondence and non-statutory documents, with the Defense Secretary also able to use the title of Secretary of War. Trump stated the change reflects a need for a stronger name, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cited a goal of "restoring the warrior ethos" in the military. This move reverses a change made by President Harry Truman, who established the Department of Defense to encompass a broader range of military and intelligence functions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged their books were illegally used to train the AI chatbot, Claude. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, would compensate authors approximately $3,000 for each of the estimated 500,000 books involved. The case centered on Anthropic's use of pirated book copies from websites like Library Genesis to build its large language models.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written response to a dissenting opinion by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent case. Barrett explained that Jackson's "spirited argument" concerning nationwide injunctions warranted an equally "spirited response," emphasizing that the exchange was about legal merits, not personal animosity. Quoting her former mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, she stated, "I attack ideas. I don't attack people," and assured there was no personal conflict between them. Barrett highlighted that the court is a place where vigorous professional disagreements can coexist with collegiality and friendship.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced a pause on the electric vehicle mandate requiring 20% of new car sales to be zero-emission by 2026, citing economic pressures and U.S. trade policies. The government will also implement a "Buy Canadian" policy, prioritizing domestic goods for federal contracts to support local industries. This decision comes as Canada's economy shows signs of weakening, with a loss of 66,000 jobs in August and unemployment rising to 7.1%. While the short-term EV target is suspended, the long-term goals of 60% by 2030 and 100% by 2035 remain in place.</p>

Officials stated Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander and not the intended target of the gunfire, which also wounded a 16-year-old on a bike.

          <p>The latest U.S. jobs report, which showed a higher-than-expected unemployment rate of 4.3% and minimal job growth, could lead to further declines in mortgage rates. A weakening economy often prompts the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, and lenders have already begun pricing in an anticipated rate cut. The disappointing employment data may encourage the Fed to implement a larger reduction than previously expected at its upcoming meeting. This could push mortgage rates, which recently hit an 11-month low, even lower, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the departure of his deputy prime minister, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle, signaling a significant reset for his government. Rather than simply filling the vacant post, Starmer has recast his top team, including appointing a new home secretary and a new foreign secretary. This decisive action is seen as an attempt to seize control of the political narrative and re-energize a government that has faced a difficult first year with declining approval ratings. The move is a high-stakes effort to demonstrate authority and focus on delivery ahead of future political battles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. jobs market showed significant signs of slowing, adding only 22,000 jobs in August, far below expectations and continuing a cooling trend amid new trade tariffs. The report also revised June's figures to a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first monthly decline since December 2020, while the national unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Job losses were notable in the federal and manufacturing sectors, and the unemployment gap between Black and white Americans widened. The weak data intensifies pressure on the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

Bucur, who has a prior criminal record for burglary and auto theft in California, was arrested, and deputies also found a pipe with methamphetamine residue at the scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" signals a significant strategic pivot away from developing new consumer electric vehicles, focusing instead on artificial intelligence, humanoid robots, and a fleet of autonomous robotaxis. The document outlines a future where Tesla-made robots create "sustainable abundance," a vision that notably omits any mention of new car models like the long-rumored $25,000 EV. This shift comes as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid growing competition and aligns with a new potential pay package for CEO Elon Musk tied to deploying millions of robots. Critics suggest this AI-centric bet risks neglecting the core car business that generates nearly all of the company's revenue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially dropped a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airlines, which argued it would increase ticket prices and operational burdens. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will focus on implementing consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds, while reconsidering extra-statutory rules.

Fellow veterans argue that his arrest for non-violent participation in a protest is an attempt to criminalize peaceful dissent and is contrary to American values.

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online shopping or browsing is not a valid reason for dismissal. An accountancy administrator, who was fired after spy software tracked her visiting sites like Amazon and Rightmove, was awarded over £14,000 for unfair dismissal. The judge determined that her personal computer use was not excessive, a significant portion was for professional development, and the company had no clear policy against it. The ruling suggested the employer's true motive was to dismiss the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger legal protections.</p>

Democratic governors in Illinois and Maryland have vowed legal challenges, arguing the move is a political stunt, not a genuine effort to fight crime.

CEO Calvin McDonald explained that increased tariff rates and the removal of the de minimis exemption for smaller shipments were major factors.
