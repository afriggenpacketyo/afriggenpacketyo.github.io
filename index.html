          <p>A federal court in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and active-duty Marines in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. This 1878 law prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement purposes, a principle the court found was systematically breached. The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, blocks the administration from using military personnel for civilian law enforcement tasks like arrests and crowd control in the state. The lawsuit was initially brought by California Governor Gavin Newsom in response to the deployments during protests over immigration enforcement.</p>

The MSP is also facing a separate criminal charge, which he denies, related to allegedly hiding a secret camera in a parliament toilet. Girlguiding Scotland confirmed the visit occurred but stated their safeguarding procedures were followed and no girls were affected. The revelations have caused significant shock and distress within the Scottish Parliament, prompting a review of safety and access protocols.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have spread across Indonesia, resulting in at least eight deaths and hundreds of injuries after footage showed elite paramilitary police running over a 21-year-old delivery driver. The unrest is fueled by deep-seated public anger over economic hardship, rising inequality, and a political elite perceived as detached from citizens' struggles. Demonstrators have issued a list of demands, including an investigation into the killing and significant political reforms. In response, President Prabowo Subianto has deployed the military and described some protest actions as "treason," raising concerns about a potential escalation of state-led repression.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man in Houston, Texas, has been charged with murder after fatally shooting an 11-year-old boy. The incident occurred late Saturday night when the boy and his friends were allegedly participating in a "ding-dong-ditch" style prank, which has seen a resurgence due to social media trends. The suspect, Leon Gonzalo Jr., was arrested after police were told the boy was running from a house after ringing the doorbell just before he was shot. The child was pronounced dead at a hospital on Sunday, sparking a tragic end to what authorities describe as a social media-fueled prank.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates hovering near 7%, prospective homebuyers face a difficult decision on whether to lock in a rate this September or wait for potential decreases. Financial experts suggest that borrowers already under contract for a home should lock in their rate to avoid market volatility and ensure a smooth closing. However, for those casually searching or with credit scores they can improve, waiting might be advantageous, as a potential Federal Reserve rate cut this fall could push rates lower. The advice underscores the importance of individual financial situations, as refinancing may only be beneficial if it reduces the rate by at least 0.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

Rowan suggests that private markets, especially private credit, offer a more effective way to invest in the broader economy and achieve better returns.

          <h2>Economist Warns Nearly One-Third of US Economy May Be in or Near Recession</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, states representing nearly a third of the U.S. GDP are currently in or at high risk of a recession. His analysis of state-level economic data reveals a fractured economy, with another third of states holding steady and the remaining third still experiencing growth. States like Minnesota and Washington are struggling, potentially due to trade war impacts, while southern states like Florida and Texas remain strong but are showing signs of slowing growth. Zandi highlights that the economic performance of pivotal states like California and New York will be crucial in determining if the national economy officially enters a downturn.

          <p>China is set to host a massive military parade in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in attendance. The event will showcase China's advanced military hardware, including hypersonic weapons and nuclear-capable missiles, in a powerful display of its growing might. The joint appearance of Xi Jinping, Putin, and Kim is being widely interpreted as a deliberate show of solidarity and a direct challenge to the U.S.-led global order. This gathering of leaders from heavily sanctioned nations underscores a deepening anti-Western alliance.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked women's tennis player Aryna Sabalenka has stated that drinking tequila makes her "feel great" the next day, contributing to the spirit's growing reputation as a 'cleaner' alcoholic beverage. While industry insiders note that additive-free, 100% agave tequila may be better tolerated due to fewer chemical byproducts called congeners, health experts are quick to dismiss any claims of it being a hangover-proof or wellness-friendly drink. They emphasize that ethanol is the primary cause of hangovers and that all alcohol consumption carries health risks, including impaired muscle recovery, which is critical for athletes. The consensus remains that moderation is key, regardless of the type of alcohol.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug developers are increasingly using artificial intelligence for discovery and safety testing, a shift supported by the FDA's goal to reduce animal testing within the next five years. Companies like Certara, Schrodinger, and Recursion are leveraging AI to predict drug toxicity and efficacy, which experts believe could cut development timelines and costs by at least half. For instance, Recursion advanced a cancer drug candidate to clinical testing in just 18 months, compared to the industry average of 42 months. While AI and new methods like 'organs-on-chips' are unlikely to completely replace animal studies, they are becoming crucial for making drug development faster and more efficient.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched a campaign directly contacting tens of thousands of international students, warning them they face removal if they overstay their visas. This action follows what the government calls an "alarming" increase in students legally arriving on study visas and then claiming asylum upon expiration, with around 14,800 such applications in the year to June. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated some students are making asylum claims without any change in their home country's situation. While refugee advocates argue that circumstances can change or individuals may only feel safe to claim asylum once in the UK, the government is tightening rules to curb this route.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has suffered a major cyber-attack that has "severely disrupted" its vehicle production and retail operations.

The incident occurred at a particularly crucial time for UK car sales, coinciding with the release of new registration plates on September 1st.

The pipeline will transport 50 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually from Russia's West Siberia to northern China via Mongolia, providing a crucial new market for Russian energy giant Gazprom. This move comes as Russia's gas exports to Europe have plummeted following the invasion of Ukraine, forcing Moscow to pivot its energy strategy eastward.

He aims to win at least 30 parliamentary seats in the next election and expressed openness to working with other left-wing figures to challenge the current government.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields jumped significantly after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, a decision that could force the government to issue refunds. The 30-year bond yield surpassed 4.98% on concerns that refunding the $172 billion in collected tariff revenue would exacerbate the U.S. budget deficit and necessitate a surge in Treasury issuance. The court determined that only Congress has the constitutional power to implement such sweeping levies. The Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, but the decision has already unsettled bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

As geopolitical competition intensifies, Mongolia's vast mineral wealth, including critical rare earths, has increased its strategic importance on the global stage.
