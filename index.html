          <p>A widespread power outage impacted Spain and Portugal, disrupting transportation, communication, and daily life for millions. Spain's power company reported that nearly all power had been restored after approximately 18 hours. The cause of the blackout, which affected airports, trains, traffic lights, and other critical infrastructure, is under investigation, but officials have ruled out foul play. The outage prompted widespread disruption, including halted trains, closed businesses, and reliance on backup generators for essential services. Optimism rests on the rapid restoration of power and the absence of malicious intent.</p>

          <p>BP announced a 49% decrease in first-quarter profit, falling short of analyst predictions, influenced by weaker crude prices and a recent strategic overhaul. The company faces increasing pressure from activist investors following its decision to reduce renewable energy investments and increase spending on oil and gas. This strategic shift came after a period of underperformance compared to its industry peers, and the company is trying to rebuild investor confidence. The results also follow a shareholder rebellion at the company's annual general meeting, highlighting investor frustration.</p>

          <p>China is developing an extensive underwater network called "Underwater BeiDou" to enhance navigation, environmental monitoring, and potentially track underwater vehicles. The project, led by the Ministry of Natural Resources, involves a network of surface and submerged buoys, along with seafloor nodes. The network aims to expand China's maritime capabilities and address gaps in current underwater observation systems. Surface buoys will use satellite receivers for real-time data transmission, while submerged buoys will monitor water currents and salinity changes.</p>

          <p>London rental prices have reached a new record high, marking the fourteenth consecutive month of increasing rents, with the average now at £2,698 per month. Outside of London, average advertised rents have also surged to £1,349 per month. Despite an increase in the supply of rental homes, demand remains high, driven by a tenant interest exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The rental market is showing signs of cooling, with rents increasing more slowly and some landlords reducing advertised prices, but regional variations persist.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Pension Reforms Aim to Consolidate Small Pots</h2>

          <p>The government is planning to introduce a Small Pots Data Platform to consolidate pension pots worth less than £1,000, addressing the issue of numerous small pots accumulated through auto-enrolment. The platform aims to streamline pension management by transferring small pots to a single provider. Experts suggest the infrastructure could be expanded to facilitate a Lifetime Pot model, allowing individuals to maintain a single pension throughout their career. Individuals can currently track down their pensions by contacting the Government's Pension Tracing Service and consider consolidating them, while being mindful of potential exit penalties.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's earlier claims of resolving the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours, a ceasefire agreement remains elusive after his first 100 days in office. Talks between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine are ongoing, but progress is limited, with both sides accusing each other of sabotaging negotiations. The U.S. has threatened to withdraw from talks if compromise is not imminent. Some analysts suggest that Putin benefits from maintaining the status quo, and Trump's desire for a Nobel Peace Prize may not align with Russia's interests.</p>
