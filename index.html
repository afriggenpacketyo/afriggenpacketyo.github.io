          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, sustained damage after its masts collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. The incident occurred during a festive visit to the US, with footage showing the ship's towering masts clipping the bridge as it passed underneath. Parts of the masts reportedly fell onto the deck, and while initial reports suggested multiple injuries, the Mexican Navy confirmed the damage and initiated an investigation into the cause of the collision, although they did not report on the injury reports. The incident prompted a response from New York City's Emergency Management.</p>

          <p>In Farmersville, Illinois, a first date between Leslie Reeves and Chris Smith turned deadly when both were shot in Smith's home. Reeves was found murdered, shot in the head, while Smith was barely conscious with a bullet lodged in his brain; he was rushed to the hospital and survived. Investigators suspected a third person was involved due to the chaotic crime scene, including a broken door and signs of a struggle. Suspicion fell on Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who lied about his whereabouts and relationship with Reeves. Tarr was eventually convicted of first-degree murder and attempted murder, while Smith has been recovering since the incident.</p>

Both Clark and Reese downplayed the severity of the incident after the game, characterizing it as a routine basketball play. The game marked Clark's WNBA debut, where she achieved a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.</p>

          <p>Severe tornadoes swept through Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, causing widespread destruction and claiming the lives of at least 27 people.

The spring tornado season has been especially brutal, straining disaster relief efforts already impacted by staffing and funding cuts.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging Chicago into near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning for the first time in the city's history. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and traveled to downtown Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. Exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.</p>

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the United Kingdom's Eurovision entry faced disappointment, with Remember Monday finishing in 19th place. Despite strong vocals and harmonies from the group, the song was criticized for being a "manic mish-mash of musical styles" that lacked consistency. While the professional juries recognized the clever British touches and witty lyrics, the song failed to resonate with the public vote. The staging, designed to highlight the band's friendship, was considered too busy and lacking the impact of other performances.</p>

Trump insisted that foreign producers should pay for the tariffs and that companies should absorb the additional expenses. A Walmart spokesperson stated that the company aims to keep prices as low as possible, but there is a limit to what they can bear given small retail margins.</p>

          <p>Former Conservative minister Michael Gove stated that another Scottish independence referendum could occur if there is "overwhelming support" for it, echoing sentiments from SNP leader John Swinney. Gove, who oversaw relations between the UK and Scottish governments, cautioned against complacency and emphasized the need to demonstrate the UK's effectiveness. Swinney has also called for "demonstrable support" for independence, similar to the backing for the 1997 Scottish parliament referendum. Gove added that the likelihood of a second independence vote was linked to the SNP's ability to improve public services.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have seen a shift in public perception due to pop culture and a greater understanding of trauma and sexual abuse. Once portrayed as greedy monsters, they now have a new generation of supporters who sympathize with their claims of sexual abuse by their father. A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. Kim Kardashian has publicly backed their bid for freedom, citing the limited resources for abuse victims, particularly boys, in the 1990s.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but only for older adults and those over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This restriction limits access for healthy individuals under 65, raising concerns about protection against emerging variants and limiting vaccine options. The approval also requires Novavax to conduct studies on potential heart conditions associated with the vaccine, potentially costing tens of millions of dollars. Experts have expressed disappointment, citing concerns about the impact on vaccine availability and public confidence.</p>

Despite efforts to manage the influx of tourists, residents feel the problems outweigh the benefits.
