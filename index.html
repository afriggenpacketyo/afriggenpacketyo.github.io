          <p>Britain's Shell announced better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a challenging market of lower global oil and gas prices. The energy giant maintained its pace of shareholder returns, declaring another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the company's performance and strategic transformation, noting Shell's shares have outperformed many European and U.S. rivals this year. This financial stability underscores the company's robust operational discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly appealed to US President Donald Trump not to consider pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell, vehemently stating she deserves to remain imprisoned. Their statement questioned Trump's recent assertion that Epstein "stole people that worked for me," including Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club. The family clarified that Maxwell preyed upon their sister in 2000 while she was a Mar-a-Lago employee, years before Trump and Epstein's reported falling out. They also expressed dismay over federal prosecutors holding recent meetings with Maxwell.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight en route from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence. Twenty-five individuals aboard the Airbus A330-900, which carried 275 passengers and 13 crew members, were subsequently hospitalized for evaluation and care. Flight tracking data revealed the aircraft experienced a sharp altitude change approximately 40 minutes into its journey. While serious in-flight turbulence injuries are uncommon, experts suggest they may become more frequent as climate change impacts atmospheric conditions.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the Army helicopter involved in a January collision with a commercial plane over Washington, D.C., had incorrect altitude readings, contributing to the deadly incident that killed 67 people. Air traffic controllers had reportedly warned about helicopter traffic hazards near Ronald Reagan National Airport for years, but the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) did not address these concerns. The NTSB hearing highlighted systemic issues, including altimeter discrepancies in Black Hawk helicopters and a lack of accountability among federal agencies. This ongoing investigation aims to prevent future aviation tragedies.</p>

          <p>A recent barrage of Russian drones and missiles struck multiple districts across Kyiv, resulting in at least six fatalities, including a six-year-old boy, and injuring over 50 people. One direct hit completely destroyed an entire entrance of a residential high-rise building, with rescue efforts ongoing to clear the rubble. Ukrainian officials reported that Russia fired 309 drones and cruise missiles, many of which successfully bypassed air defenses. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned these attacks as "demonstrative murder," reiterating that peace for Ukraine is impossible without strength and continued international support.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary is scheduled to meet with the head of NATS, the national air traffic control provider, following a system outage that caused extensive flight disruptions across the country. Although NATS quickly resolved the "radar-related" issue by switching to a back-up system, over 150 flights were canceled and thousands more experienced significant delays. Airlines are demanding answers, with some, like Ryanair, calling for the NATS chief executive's resignation, citing a similar major outage in 2023.

          <p>India has shown no haste in finalizing a trade agreement with the United States, despite President Trump imposing 25% duties and an unspecified "penalty" on its imports. New Delhi prioritizes protecting its substantial farming sector, resisting greater market access for American agricultural products. India's Commerce and Industry Minister affirmed that trade agreements are not dictated by deadlines, emphasizing the country's national interest. Analysts suggest the US strategically needs India as a manufacturing alternative to China, providing India significant leverage in these ongoing negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a second-quarter operating profit of 4.7 trillion Korean won ($3.38 billion), falling short of expectations due to a drastic 93.8% slump in its memory chip business. The Device Solutions division's profit plummeted significantly, impacted by inventory value adjustments and one-off costs related to China export restrictions. Despite this downturn, Samsung's chief financial officer expressed optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, anticipating a rebound driven by increasing momentum in AI and robotics. The company also secured a major chip supply contract with Tesla, aiming to bolster its foundry business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK high streets are facing an "endless battle" against criminal gangs engaged in the sale of illegal tobacco and vapes, as reported by Trading Standards officials. In Newport, 19 shops were closed in nine months due to these illicit activities, which are linked to forced labor, illegal workers, and open drug dealing. This trade undermines legitimate businesses and deprives public services of substantial revenue, with authorities struggling due to limited enforcement powers. Criminals frequently evade closures by relocating or using "stash cars" for illegal stock, posing ongoing safety concerns for communities.</p>

The draft map, reportedly endorsed by President Trump, aims to transform five currently Democratic-held US House districts into GOP-leaning seats, potentially expanding the Republican majority in Congress. Democrats contend the plan deliberately fragments Black and Latino communities for partisan advantage and could backfire given recent shifts in Latino voter support.
