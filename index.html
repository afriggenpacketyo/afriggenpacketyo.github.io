            <p>Severe flooding in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has resulted in at least 33 deaths and widespread displacement. Heavy rains caused the Ndjili River to overflow, submerging hundreds of buildings and blocking access roads, hindering rescue efforts. Many residents have criticized the government's slow response, while officials work to provide emergency shelters and restore access to drinking water in affected areas. This disaster compounds existing humanitarian challenges in the eastern part of the country, where ongoing conflict has created a major crisis.</p>

            <p>Birmingham, the U.K.'s second-largest city, is facing a sanitation crisis as a strike by garbage collectors enters its fifth week. Piles of garbage have accumulated, leading to public health concerns and prompting the city council to declare a major incident. The strike stems from a dispute over job eliminations and pay cuts, exacerbated by the council's financial difficulties following a settlement over historic pay discrimination. The situation has drawn criticism from opposition parties, with calls for a swift resolution to protect public health.</p>

            <p>Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, is advocating for a significant interest rate cut to 4% in response to the financial instability caused by Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Bean argues that the uncertainty created by the tariffs will negatively impact business investment and consumer spending, necessitating a more aggressive monetary policy response than currently anticipated by financial markets. Another former rate setter, David Blanchflower, has urged the Bank to hold an emergency meeting to consider a deep reduction in the cost of borrowing to bolster confidence and prevent an economic downturn.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent imposition of sweeping tariffs on imports from numerous countries is potentially opening the door for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As countries seek to counter Trump's tariff regime, China's long-standing application to join the CPTPP may gain momentum. The CPTPP, a 12-member trading bloc, includes countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, and could offer an alternative to reliance on the U.S. market.</p>

This agreement aims to streamline law enforcement efforts while protecting the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers. However, some IRS officials have raised concerns about the policy's scope and its potential impact on tax collection from illegal immigrants.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility as President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China, raising concerns about a potential U.S. recession. Leading indexes initially fell sharply before briefly rebounding on a false report of a tariff freeze, then declined again in the afternoon. Economists at Goldman Sachs have increased the odds of a recession to 45% due to the combination of larger tariffs, policy uncertainty, and declining business and consumer confidence. Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses, reflecting global concerns over the escalating trade tensions.</p>

The court mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. The Trump administration says all the deportees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The decision vacates an earlier ruling by a federal judge that had temporarily blocked the use of the law to carry out the deportations.</p>

            <p>Numerous colleges and universities across the United States are reporting that their international students have had their visas revoked by the Trump administration. These incidents are part of what appears to be mass targeting of international students by the administration over alleged violations of their visa or green card conditions. The State Department has revoked over 300 student visas nationwide since the beginning of Trump's second term.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened China with an extra 50% tariff on goods imported into the US if it does not withdraw its 34% counter-tariff, as global markets continue to fall. Beijing retaliated after Trump's decision to set a minimum 10% levy on nearly all of America's trading partners. In response, the Chinese embassy in the US accused Washington of "economic bullying", and said that Beijing "will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests". Uncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets.</p>

            <p>As the US President Donald Trump instigates a global trade war, the level of engagement between Europe and China has only increased. There is a softening tone towards China from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and a stream of European diplomats and officials visiting Beijing. The reciprocal tariffs also go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries. Economists will tell you that tariffs are basically a sales tax on local consumers, and they can spark further inflation.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court handed down a 5-4 decision tossing out a closely watched district court decision, which blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to use a 227-year-old law to deport many individuals without due process. The Court largely voted along party lines, although Republican Justice Amy Coney Barrett crossed over to dissent with the three Democratic justices. The Court does not express an opinion on whether the Alien Enemies Act actually permits Trump to deport anyone, but rules that, before anyone is deported under this law, that person must be given “notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”</p>
