          <p>The World Health Organization is preparing for significant budget cuts as the United States nears its official departure, initiated by President Trump due to accusations of COVID-19 mishandling. With the U.S. contributing around 18% of the WHO's funding, the agency is exploring ways to prioritize high-value activities such as vaccine guidelines and outbreak responses, while potentially scaling back training programs and offices in wealthier nations. China is expected to increase its financial contribution, and the WHO is also seeking support from pharmaceutical companies and philanthropic organizations to ensure key projects remain afloat amidst these financial adjustments. The organization is adapting to a new world order in global health governance, prompting a re-examination of its operations and priorities.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that while President Trump's family's blatant profiting from his office is unprecedented, it's part of a longer history of politicians leveraging their positions for personal gain. From foreign deals to cryptocurrency ventures and access-peddling clubs, the Trump family's actions highlight a systemic issue. The author points to Hunter Biden's past activities and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign funds as examples of how American politicians have long been for sale. The article calls for Congress to pass legislation preventing former politicians and their families from engaging in foreign lobbying and deals, and for future administrations to prosecute any illegal enrichment activities by former presidents.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance rail travel in the United States. Europe is investing in night trains to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and government initiatives. In contrast, the United States continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting public infrastructure and rail systems. The article highlights the correlation between car dependence and decreased happiness, advocating for investment in rail networks and subway systems as a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative to cars and air travel.</p>

Alleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of previously inactive social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of an "aggressive Russian hybrid attack," which Moscow denies.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee due to budget deficits. The changes aim to address a $12 billion budget shortfall attributed to Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19, while those with an "unsatisfactory" status would face a $100 monthly charge starting in 2027. These measures are projected to save California $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-29.</p>

          <p>China announced anti-dumping duties on imports of POM copolymers from the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan, with rates as high as 74.9%. The move follows a probe launched after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and other imports. The highest anti-dumping rates of 74.9% were levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments will face 34.5% duties. This comes as hopes rise that the U.S.-China trade war is easing, with both sides agreeing to slash reciprocal tariffs in a 90-day truce.</p>

          <p>An explosion outside a Palm Springs fertility clinic resulted in one death and several injuries, with authorities calling it an "intentional act of terrorism." The blast, which damaged nearby buildings, prompted evacuations in Twentynine Palms, and the FBI has identified a person of interest. The clinic confirmed that staff and stored embryos were unharmed, and government leaders have condemned the violence. Due to the wide debris field from the explosion, which occurred within a 250 foot radius according to the FBI, officials asked residents to leave anything they believed to be debris alone and contact them for further investigation.</p>

          <p>Sir Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans to exempt technology firms from copyright laws regarding AI, labeling them "absolute losers" and feeling "incredibly betrayed." He argues that allowing AI firms to use artists' content without payment is "committing theft, thievery on a high scale" and would rob young people of their legacy and income. The government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to force AI companies to disclose what material they were using to develop their programmes, but a government spokesperson said that "no changes" to copyright laws would be "considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators". He threatened legal action if the plans are not changed, while other artists and industry figures have also voiced concerns.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting warnings from the National Weather Service. The storm, driven by strong winds and dry soil, created a dramatic scene in Chicago, reducing visibility to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. Such storms are uncommon in the area, with the last significant event occurring during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The Weather Service attributed the storm to dry soil conditions and strong winds generated by thunderstorms, classifying it as a haboob.</p>

The situation is complicated by nuclear arsenals, religious nationalism, and superpower politics, making any conciliatory gesture all but impossible. While India has pursued a tougher approach, including military retaliation and covert operations, the specter of nuclear war limits what it can achieve through force.</p>
