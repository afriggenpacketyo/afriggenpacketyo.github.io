          <p>The Senate has narrowly voted to advance President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," a massive tax and immigration package, following a tense and prolonged session. The procedural victory was secured only after a last-minute vote change by a Republican senator, avoiding a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. The article also notes that a federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump executive order targeting a law firm, ruling the action unconstitutional and a threat to the independence of the bar.

          <p>After a six-year wait for justice, a jury has convicted Samuel Woodward of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement for the 2018 killing of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student.

Under this partnership, supermarkets and manufacturers will decide on their own methods, such as promotions or loyalty point incentives for healthier products, to help tackle rising obesity rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon causing cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, releasing it slowly and elevating temperatures, especially overnight. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water benefit from natural cooling through evaporation. With global temperatures rising, this effect makes growing urban populations increasingly vulnerable to the dangers of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march, citing a controversial law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, enabled it to proceed as a council-organized event. The large turnout, significantly higher than last year, was seen by many as a powerful and peaceful act of defiance against the government's restrictive policies.</p>
