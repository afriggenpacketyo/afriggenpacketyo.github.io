          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Lifted for Hawaii and West Coast Following Major 8.8 Magnitude Earthquake Off Russia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:59:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific. While initial warnings prompted evacuations in Hawaii, Japan, and along the U.S. West Coast, the resulting waves were smaller than first feared, leading to most warnings being downgraded to advisories. Officials reported minor flooding in some coastal areas but no substantial damage, though they continued to caution the public about dangerous currents and strong waves for several hours. The event caused significant transportation disruptions and served as a major test for tsunami preparedness systems across multiple nations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its current interest rate at its upcoming meeting, but the decision is surrounded by significant intrigue. Two governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have advocated for a rate cut and may issue a rare double dissent, creating internal division. Externally, the central bank faces continued pressure from President Trump to ease policy, alongside economic data complicated by tariff impacts. Despite arguments for a cut due to limited inflation and a potentially fragile labor market, the committee is likely to hold its position, delaying any potential changes until at least September.

          <h2>Major US Companies Warn of Hundreds of Millions in Costs Due to New Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:51:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent American companies, including Stanley Black & Decker, Conagra, and General Motors, are publicly warning that new tariffs will significantly increase their operational costs, with some projecting impacts in the hundreds of millions of dollars. These firms are bracing for higher import taxes on materials like steel and aluminum, which affects everything from tool manufacturing to food packaging. While many businesses are currently absorbing these expenses, economists caution that the costs may soon be passed on to consumers, potentially leading to a notable rise in inflation, highlighting the broad economic pressure from the new trade policies.

          <p>A recent episode of the podcast Code Switch delves into the increasingly popular phrase "joy is resistance." The discussion unpacks the complex meaning behind the slogan, exploring what joy truly is and under what circumstances it can function as a potent tool for social and political change. The hosts examine why this concept has gained so much traction in contemporary discourse, particularly during times when experiencing joy can feel difficult or tenuous for many communities. The segment aims to provide a deeper understanding of how a personal emotion can be transformed into a collective act of defiance and resilience.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts man has been sentenced to time served after being imprisoned for over two years for a dangerous in-flight incident. In March 2023, on a United Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Boston, Francisco Severo Torres attempted to open an emergency exit door before attacking a flight attendant with a broken metal spoon, striking him in the neck. Passengers and crew subdued Torres, who was heard yelling threats to take over the plane. He pleaded guilty to interference with a flight crew and will now serve five years of supervised release, during which he is banned from commercial flights.</p>

          <p>In a recent statement, President Donald Trump indicated that Ukrainian refugees who fled to the United States following Russia's invasion will likely be allowed to stay until the conflict ends. This marks a potential shift from earlier administration considerations, which included terminating the "Uniting for Ukraine" parole program and even using foreign aid funds for repatriation. Approximately 240,000 Ukrainian nationals have arrived in the U.S. since 2022, and their residency status had been uncertain amid a broader crackdown on immigration. Trump's comments suggest a decision is forthcoming that will provide temporary relief for these displaced individuals.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby union is facing significant pressure from the dominance of rugby league (NRL) and Australian Rules Football (AFL), which attract a large portion of the nation's top athletic talent. Despite this, experts see a "golden decade" ahead with the upcoming Lions tour and the 2027 and 2029 Rugby World Cups set to be hosted in Australia. Commentators like former player Michael Hooper emphasize that consistent, gritty performances are needed to win back fans in a country that loves a winner. While the talent drain is a major challenge, there is optimism that the sport can leverage upcoming major events to regain prominence.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a draft budget for 2026 that signals a significant shift from its traditional fiscal conservatism. The budget proposes spending of €520.5 billion, including €174 billion in new borrowing, to fund major investments in infrastructure modernization and defense. This move aims to stimulate economic growth after a period of stagnation, with the German economy having contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter. The article also notes other national news, including the cancellation of Berlin's iconic New Year's Eve party at the Brandenburg Gate due to budget cuts and a government review of controversial Palantir security software.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the work of Lawrence Dennis, a Black intellectual who passed as white and advocated for fascism in 1930s America, to draw parallels with modern anti-liberal arguments. Dennis believed the Great Depression proved that liberalism's focus on individual liberty and free markets was obsolete, arguing for an elite-led, state-controlled economy. The author identifies two "anti-liberal traps" in Dennis's failed predictions that are echoed today: blaming a crisis on unchangeable liberal philosophy and idealizing illiberal alternatives. Dennis's story serves as a cautionary tale against declaring liberalism's inevitable doom and underestimating its capacity for reform and adaptation.</p>

          <p>Residents of Hawaii, particularly on the island of Maui, evacuated coastal areas and moved to higher ground after a powerful earthquake near Russia triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific. Although the tsunami warning was later downgraded to an advisory, waves several feet high were recorded, causing concern and significant traffic jams as people heeded official advice. For many on Maui, the evacuation brought back memories of the devastating wildfires two years prior, reinforcing the seriousness of the situation. While the waves did not cause catastrophic damage, the event highlighted the community's preparedness and the lingering anxieties from past disasters.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming report on U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to show modest but sturdy economic growth of 2.3% for the second quarter, suggesting the economy has so far avoided a significant downturn from President Trump's tariffs. However, the data's clarity is blurred by the mechanics of GDP calculation, where a drop in imports can artificially inflate the growth figure. Despite initial fears of a consumer pullback, spending has remained resilient, and the unemployment rate is near a historic low. This report will be a key data point for the Federal Reserve, which is observing the tariff effects before making any interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Stokes' absence is a considerable blow, given his recent outstanding form, which included a century and a five-wicket haul in the previous match.

          <p>New research reveals that Elon Musk's rightward political turn and alignment with Donald Trump have not only damaged Tesla's brand among US liberals but have also eroded their support for the entire electric vehicle category. A study published in Nature shows that as liberals' opinion of Tesla plummeted, their intention to buy any EV also slipped into negative territory. The researchers suggest Musk became so synonymous with EVs that his controversial image dragged down the entire class of products. Interestingly, the shift did not correspondingly boost interest among conservatives, who remain largely skeptical of electric cars despite a more favorable view of the Tesla brand itself.</p>

This strategy is statistically extreme, with the team attempting fewer long passes than any top team in Europe or MLS history.

Bove, who previously served on Trump's legal team, became known for his aggressive enforcement of the president's will at the Department of Justice. His confirmation, despite whistleblower allegations and opposition from former DOJ lawyers, suggests that personal loyalty and a willingness to challenge institutional norms may now be a more direct path to a judicial appointment than traditional ideological alignment with conservative legal movements like the Federalist Society, which previously vetted nominees.</p>

          <p>Meeting a partner through a friend's introduction, once the most common way for heterosexual couples to connect, has become a rarity in the era of dating apps. This article explores the decline of the "setup," noting that by 2017, only 20% of straight couples met through friends, compared to 39% who met online. While singles express fatigue with apps, they have not returned to relying on their social networks, partly because apps offer a wider pool of potential partners and more individual control. The shift reflects a broader cultural change where partner selection has become a private, individual quest rather than a community-facilitated process.</p>

          <p>The AMC A-List movie subscription service has evolved from a loyalty program into a cultural phenomenon, especially among Gen Z. For a monthly fee, members can see up to four movies a week, a deal that has fostered a dedicated, cult-like following who flaunt their membership on social media and dating apps. This enthusiasm, fueled by internet memes and the iconic Nicole Kidman ad, has created a powerful marketing engine for the financially struggling theater chain. The program's popularity challenges the notion that younger generations have abandoned the cinema, proving to be a bright spot for AMC and a signifier of community for its members.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles dance community is grappling with a severe funding crisis following the termination of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) under the Trump administration. At least 30 local arts organizations have lost crucial funding, forcing them to scale back tours, cut programming, and reevaluate staff salaries. The cuts have created a state of emergency for an already underfunded discipline, with small nonprofits and underserved communities hit hardest. With the future of federal arts funding uncertain and the NEA's dance division currently inactive, local companies are left scrambling to secure alternative support from private and state-level sources to survive.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has solidified her role as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the regime. Serving as the vice director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department, she is often described as her brother's mouthpiece and is responsible for much of Pyongyang's sharp rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea. Educated in Switzerland alongside her brother, she has become his most trusted aide, frequently appearing at key state events and international summits. Her prominence has fueled speculation that she could be a potential successor, though experts note succession has historically been patrilineal.</p>

The gym's signature class, "Slashercise," features aerobics-style movements inspired by iconic horror films, complete with props like plastic chainsaws and video screens looping scenes of famous movie monsters. Co-owners Vanessa Decker and Ama Lea developed the idea from a fake movie concept, which evolved into a real film and now a brick-and-mortar business.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the federal government can learn from successful deregulation efforts in states like Virginia to effectively reduce red tape. Virginia's governor set a goal to cut regulatory requirements by 25%, a target that was met and is projected to save businesses and citizens over $1.2 billion annually. The state achieved this with a small, dedicated office and is now piloting AI technology to scan and compare regulations for inefficiencies. The author suggests that a similar, data-driven approach at the federal level, backed by a modest investment, could yield a significant return by streamlining codes and boosting the economy, particularly in heavily regulated sectors like housing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature Communications indicates that the collective experience of living through the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with accelerated brain aging, even in individuals who were never infected with the virus. Researchers believe the cumulative stressors of the period—including isolation, disrupted routines, and economic uncertainty—likely contributed to subtle but measurable changes in the brain. While the effect was seen across the study group, only those who had contracted COVID-19 showed small declines in cognitive performance. The findings suggest the pandemic's profound societal impact left a lasting mark on neurological health, independent of direct infection.</p>

          <p>A wave of legislative proposals in numerous states is targeting the use of synthetic food dyes and other chemical additives, driven in part by the conservative "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. Championed by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this political shift has led lawmakers to propose bans on additives like Red No. 3, Blue 1, and Yellow 6. While some bills have become law, such as in Arizona and Utah for school foods, the food industry expresses concern over a patchwork of state regulations. This trend reflects growing consumer frustration with federal inaction and may ultimately push the FDA to establish a new, uniform national standard.</p>

By bringing its own resources, optimized seeds, and expertise, the Vietnamese company is helping Cuba address severe shortages of fertilizer, fuel, and equipment.

The revision for China was the largest for any economy in the IMF's latest report. A key factor in this optimistic outlook is China's success in diversifying its export markets, with robust growth in shipments to Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe offsetting a decline in exports to the United States. This performance has helped bolster China's overall trade growth and economic resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's public pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates has renewed concerns about the central bank's political independence. This article explains that the Fed was designed to be insulated from short-term political influence, with governors serving long, staggered terms to ensure they can make unpopular but necessary economic decisions, such as raising rates to fight inflation. Historical examples, like President Nixon's pressure on then-Chair Arthur Burns, are often cited as cautionary tales that can lead to negative outcomes like high inflation. Experts stress that maintaining the Fed's credibility is crucial for economic stability and market confidence.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of high-income Americans are struggling to keep up with their credit card and auto loan payments, a sign of growing financial strain even among wealthier households. According to VantageScore data, delinquencies for households earning over $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023, a faster rate of increase than for lower and middle-income groups. Economists attribute this trend to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and rising housing costs, which are eroding the financial cushion that previously protected this demographic. This development could be a worrying sign for the broader economy, as wealthier consumers drive a significant portion of all spending. (not investment advice)</p>
