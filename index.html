          <p>The United Kingdom is facing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30°C (86°F) over the weekend. The Midlands and south Wales are projected to see the hottest weather, while Scotland and Northern Ireland may experience their warmest days of the year so far. Amber heat health alerts are active for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia, and authorities have issued wildfire warnings and cautioned about potential travel disruptions. The intense heat has also affected events like Wimbledon and led to hosepipe bans for millions as a result of the dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a gripping trilogy fight at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which was more tactical than their previous encounters, concluded with a majority decision in Taylor's favor, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for her. Serrano acknowledged that her more cautious strategy did not pay off, while Taylor praised her opponent's skill and resilience. The event marked a historic all-female card at the iconic venue, further cementing the legacy of this significant rivalry in women's boxing.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse in London's Mayfair has been in an eight-year legal dispute with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family. The conflict, centered at 55 Park Lane, began over a lift installation agreement and has since escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs and the malicious use of a noisy lift. This legal battle highlights the combative business practices associated with Al Fayed's empire, which appear to persist after his death. The article also notes that the neighboring building was the site of multiple sexual assault allegations against Fayed.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Pitcher Dustin May struggled, allowing seven runs and putting the Dodgers in a significant deficit that their revived offense couldn't fully overcome. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run of the season into McCovey's Cove, but it wasn't enough to secure a win. The loss marks the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and narrows their division lead to just four games as they approach the All-Star break.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah amounts to a crime against humanity, highlighting a broader failure of international law to protect Gazans. The author, Raja Shehadeh, reflects on the dehumanization of Palestinians since 1948 and the ineffectiveness of institutions like the International Criminal Court in holding Israel accountable. Despite the despair, the author finds hope in Palestinian resilience and "sumoud" (steadfastness), asserting that their humanity, not legal frameworks, will ultimately judge Israel and its allies. The piece concludes that while the world has failed to enforce international law, it can still aid in Gaza's rebuilding.</p>

As conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza deplete American stockpiles, South Korea's defense industry is increasingly filling the gap for advanced weaponry.

An article in the journal *American Studies* notes that many of Donald Trump's tech supporters advocate for continued pressure to contain China's technological growth and promote further decoupling. This trend includes deepening ties between tech firms and the U.S. defense industry, raising concerns in Beijing about the emergence of aggressive "tech hawks."

          <p>Lord Huron's 2015 song "The Night We Met" has become a massive global success a decade after its quiet release, accumulating over three billion Spotify plays. The track's popularity began to surge after it was featured in the Netflix series *13 Reasons Why* in 2017 and has since snowballed through its widespread use on TikTok. Frontman Ben Schneider attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship, allowing it to resonate with a wide audience. The song's slow-burning success has given the indie folk band a massive hit without defining their entire career.</p>

The move comes after the brand's popularity exploded on social media, which also led to stock availability issues for smaller stores.

          <p>A plan by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague has drawn significant criticism from architects, preservationists, and the public. The authority argues that a new, wider bridge with a third track is necessary to handle projected increases in rail traffic, as the current structure is corroded. However, a coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, contends that the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption.
