          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly established a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. President Trump indicated an agreement was reached that would "save" the popular app, with a final call between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled to finalize the terms. The deal follows a U.S. law that mandated TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, either divest its U.S. operations or face a ban, a measure Trump had previously delayed enforcing. The proposed solution aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing the app to continue operating for its millions of American users.</p>

Authorities state Luchin passed notes to tellers demanding money at each location before being identified and apprehended. This is not his first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his successful restaurant closed. Luchin, once celebrated for his expertise in Italian cuisine, now faces multiple charges of robbery and attempted robbery for the recent string of heists.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth around $900 billion, to incentivize his continued focus on the company. The plan is contingent on Musk leading Tesla to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion valuation and meeting other operational goals. This proposal comes as Musk's attention is divided among his many other companies and political activities. The board argues that Musk's leadership is essential to Tesla's high valuation, while Musk himself has expressed a desire to increase his ownership stake to around 25% to remain committed.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned comments made by Elon Musk at a "Unite The Kingdom" rally in London, labeling his language as "abhorrent." Speaking via video link at the event organized by a far-right activist, Musk criticized "uncontrolled migration" and stated, "You either fight back or you die." He also called for the dissolution of the British Parliament and a new election. The remarks drew sharp criticism from other UK political figures, who called them dangerous and irresponsible, with some calling for a review of government contracts with Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>In a strategic display of space-based surveillance capabilities, a Chinese satellite from the Jilin-1 constellation captured images of an American WorldView Legion satellite. This act appears to be a direct response to a similar move by the U.S. company Maxar Intelligence, which had previously released images of a high-value Chinese satellite. The Chinese company, Chang Guang Satellite Technology, published its photos of the American satellite, marking a public tit-for-tat in the increasingly competitive domain of orbital reconnaissance. Analysts view the exchange as a demonstration of the advanced observation technologies possessed by both nations.</p>

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has criticized the club's recent performance, stating they lack the quality to execute manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. The team has had its worst start to a season in decades, despite a £200 million investment in new forwards. Scholes argues the club's summer transfer strategy was flawed, as the priority should have been acquiring a controlling central midfielder. Despite growing external pressure and a recent derby loss, senior club officials reportedly remain supportive of Amorim, focusing on a long-term vision rather than immediate results.</p>

Trump stated the city is "overrun" with crime and vowed to end the "savagery," suggesting Chicago could be next.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that California, despite its immense wealth, now ties with Louisiana for the highest poverty rate in the nation, with 17.7% of its population, or 7 million residents, unable to meet basic needs. The report from the California Budget and Policy Center identifies the state's steep housing costs as a primary driver of this crisis, particularly affecting renters. Poverty rates have climbed significantly since 2021, when expanded public benefits during the pandemic had temporarily lowered them. The expiration of these policies has led to a sharp reversal, with Black and Latino populations experiencing the most severe increases.</p>

          <p>Social justice activist Reverend William Barber condemned the "brutal, ugly" assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, while also calling for a universal denunciation of all political violence. Speaking at an event commemorating the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Barber appeared to critique the right-wing "religious nationalism" espoused by Kirk and his allies. He argued that true faith must challenge injustice and warned against using religion as a cover for immoral policies. Barber emphasized that while Kirk's murder should be despised, people must also be bothered by all forms of political violence, regardless of the target's ideology.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, with voters overwhelmingly citing the city's unaffordability as their top concern. The desire for a candidate who can bring change is a major factor, benefiting Mamdani over experienced candidates like former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails far behind amid negative job approval ratings. The poll also reveals that President Trump is a factor for many voters, who prefer a mayor that would oppose him, a sentiment that strongly favors Mamdani.</p>

          <p>Costco has issued a recall for its Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene due to a risk of the bottles spontaneously shattering. The recall affects bottles sold in several Midwestern states between April and August 2025. In an unusual move reflecting the severity of the danger, the company is advising customers not to return the product to stores. Instead, they are instructed to dispose of the bottles safely by wrapping them carefully and placing them in the trash. Customers will be able to receive a full refund by presenting the notice letter they received from the retailer.</p>

          <p>While President Trump has declared his federal crackdown in Washington D.C. a success, an analysis suggests the long-term consequences could be counterproductive. The heavy presence of National Guard and federal officers appears to have had a negative economic impact, with restaurant traffic and tourism declining. Furthermore, the initiative may be eroding the crucial relationship between the community and local police, as residents grow fearful of being swept up by immigration enforcement. Experts warn that whenever the federal deployment ends, the city could face a boomerang effect of urban disorder fueled by economic strain and broken trust.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed that U.S. companies should move away from the standard practice of reporting earnings every quarter and instead adopt a semiannual schedule. In a social media post, he argued that this change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. This is not the first time the idea has been raised; during his first term, Trump asked the SEC to study the issue. While some business leaders have criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors.</p>

This change is expected to redirect investment flows from larger markets, including Indonesia and Mexico, towards smaller nations such as Thailand, Poland, and Brazil.

The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has rallied significantly from an April low, turning positive for the year despite a sales slump and brand challenges linked to Musk's political activities.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of home equity, many are looking for the best ways to tap into this financial resource. For those seeking to borrow around $50,000, several options exist, each with distinct advantages. A home equity loan offers the predictability of a fixed rate and stable monthly payments. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides flexibility, allowing homeowners to draw funds as needed. A cash-out refinance might secure a lower interest rate but resets the mortgage term, while a reverse mortgage offers an option for seniors without monthly repayments. (not investment advice)</p>
