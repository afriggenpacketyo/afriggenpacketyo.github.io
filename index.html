          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for the Victory Day parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. The parade, a display of Russian military might, also served as political theater amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with Putin alluding to the "difficult, watershed moment" in Russia's history. Xi's presence and the signing of over 20 bilateral cooperation documents emphasize the deepening ties between China and Russia, despite international sanctions and condemnation of Russia's actions in Ukraine. The event also sought to reassure the Russian people that the military's pride and morale remain intact despite the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak Office of the Inspector General report revealed that at least 119 current and former Amtrak employees conspired with New York medical professionals to defraud the company's health care plan out of over $12 million. Employees allegedly accepted cash in exchange for providing their insurance information, which was then used to file fraudulent claims for services never rendered. Twelve Amtrak employees and three healthcare providers have been criminally charged, with several employees pleading guilty to health care fraud conspiracy charges. Amtrak is considering disciplinary action for the remaining active employees involved and is calling on medical benefit providers to do more to identify and stop medical insurance fraud.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system to address outdated equipment issues.

The released documents, ordered to be made public after a request from The New York Times, indicate that the FBI and prosecutors investigated Adams for potential witness tampering. The Justice Department's move to drop the case against Adams led to the resignation of several prosecutors, and Adams is running for re-election as an independent after criticism of his alliance with Trump.</p>

Miller justified the potential suspension by arguing that the United States is facing a national security threat from undocumented migrants "invading" the country. Legal experts argue that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus, and a president cannot do so unilaterally. This consideration follows the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members and the recent release of Tufts University student Rumeysa Öztürk, who had been detained for her political views.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent public appearances and interviews have sparked debate among Democrats, with some welcoming his defense of his legacy and others viewing it as a distraction. Allies like Rep. Jim Clyburn and former DNC Chair Jamie Harrison support Biden's right to define his record, while strategists like Donna Brazile emphasize the need for new leaders to emerge. Critics argue that focusing on Biden stagnates the party and that he should follow the example of other former presidents by focusing on his library and foundation.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years and is now spiraling back to Earth. While most estimates suggest it will re-enter on Friday or Saturday, the exact time and location remain uncertain. The spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, is likely to survive its descent, although the risk of injury on the ground is considered low.</p>

          <p>Speculation about a "Yalta 2.0" summit among Trump, Xi, and Putin to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II did not come to fruition, with Xi and Putin meeting in Moscow while Trump remained absent. The absence underscores the challenges in achieving meaningful cooperation between the U.S., China, and Russia, particularly on issues like trade and the Ukraine conflict. Despite Trump's efforts to broker agreements, neither Beijing nor Moscow has shown signs of backing down on core issues, raising concerns about the stability of the US-led post-war order.</p>

Staff spotted a suspicious invitation to a meeting earlier on Friday and realized it was "spear-phishing" - which impersonates a trusted source. Parents have been sent texts telling that them students' passwords have been reset as a precaution - meaning pupils studying for exams do not currently have access to their school's learning resources.

Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, and jaundice, and severe cases can be fatal, with at least seven deaths reported. The best way to prevent infection is through vaccination and good hygiene practices, and officials are reassessing prevention efforts due to the outbreak's spread beyond traditional risk groups.</p>

Despite video evidence of the brutal beating and the police chief's condemnation, the officers avoided murder convictions, and the city has resisted federal oversight. The verdict underscores the difficulty in prosecuting officers for misconduct and the stalled momentum of broader reform efforts amid changing political winds. The article contends that the failure to secure convictions and implement greater accountability means that Nichols will not be the last to suffer an unjust death.</p>
