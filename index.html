The trend is driven by concerns over tariffs, global changes, and potential geopolitical instabilities, with 90% of new orders coming from outside Singapore.

          <p>A leaked recording reveals that a senior police officer had serious concerns about the arrest of Nicola Packer, who took abortion pills when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, believing she was only six weeks along. The officer questioned whether the arrest was "the best for Nicola" given the circumstances, but Ms. Packer was charged after police asked the Crown Prosecution Service to review the case. Ms. Packer was later acquitted, and she expressed anger at the midwives for involving the police. The case has raised concerns about patient confidentiality and the reporting of suspected crimes by medical professionals.</p>

          <p>Australian wheat inventories are expected to be much higher than last year due to reduced Chinese imports and competition from Russia, putting pressure on prices. Analysts suggest a fire sale of stored grain may be necessary before the new wheat harvest, potentially pushing prices down further.

The next Northern Hemisphere wheat harvest is expected to add further pressure, limiting Australia's export prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

A persistent property slowdown and tighter regulations in sectors like technology and online education have led to job losses. If U.S. tariffs remain high, exports to the United States could fall significantly, resulting in millions of manufacturing job losses. While the United States also faces liabilities, China may have greater "trade war endurance" due to its ability to manage discontent.</p>
