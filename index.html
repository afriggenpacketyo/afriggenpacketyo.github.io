          <p>Hurricane Melissa has strengthened into a Category 1 storm and is projected to bring life-threatening flash floods and landslides to Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center warns the storm could rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, potentially becoming the strongest of the Atlantic season. While major impacts on the mainland U.S. are not expected, the storm is forecast to produce catastrophic rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 25 inches. A hurricane warning is currently in effect for Jamaica as the storm slowly moves northwest through the Caribbean.</p>

The incident has captured the cultural zeitgeist, turning the audacious robbery into a source of widespread online amusement.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, the former wife of D.C. sniper John Allen Muhammad details the psychological abuse she endured and a chilling threat he made before his 2002 reign of terror. Dr. Mildred Muhammad explains that John's behavior changed drastically after his service in Operation Desert Storm, leading to a pattern of control and intimidation. She recounts him telling her, "You have become my enemy, and as my enemy, I will kill you." Investigators later theorized the wider shooting spree, which killed 10 people, was part of a plot to kill her and regain custody of their children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's rugby league team suffered a significant 26-6 defeat against Australia in the first Ashes match in 22 years, with head coach Shaun Wane labeling the performance as "torture." The English side was plagued by simple mistakes and wasted opportunities, allowing Australia to secure a comfortable victory without reaching its full potential. Key errors, particularly from England's fullback Jack Welsby, contrasted sharply with the standout performance of Australia's Reece Walsh. The loss puts Australia in a position to retain the Ashes with another win in the next match in Liverpool.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased online, clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, or tissue death. The case report highlights the dangers of these small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed. The teen has since recovered and was discharged from the hospital after an eight-day stay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market is currently experiencing a phenomenon dubbed the "Great Freeze," characterized by simultaneously low hiring and low layoff rates. Economists suggest that economic uncertainty is causing companies to hoard existing talent rather than expand their workforce, creating a stagnant environment. While this provides job security for the employed, it stifles career growth opportunities and makes it difficult for the unemployed to find new positions. This trend of low turnover risks hindering innovation as employees remain in static roles without opportunities for advancement or skill development. (not investment advice)</p>

This imbalance has pushed the combined weight of defensive sectors like consumer staples, health care, and utilities to an all-time low.

Cuban calculated that saving 40% on a $2,000 annual budget for essentials yields a guaranteed return of $800.

          <h2>President Trump Orders Demolition of White House East Wing for New Ballroom</h2>

          <p>The historic East Wing of the White House was demolished this week to make way for a new, privately-funded $300 million ballroom at the direction of President Donald Trump. The swift destruction of the structure, which housed the First Lady's office and has stood for over a century, has shocked many observers and former White House staffers. Critics view the move as a disregard for historical preservation and another example of the president acting without concern for traditional norms. The action raises questions about the extent of presidential authority over modifying such a cherished national landmark.</p>

          <p>Following the controversial demolition of the White House East Wing, a reporter embarked on a quest to locate the historic rubble. The search led to East Potomac Golf Links, where trucks were depositing soil from the site, reportedly to be used in creating a new golf hole. Further investigation traced the operation to an industrial park in Maryland, though workers there denied any involvement and were instructed not to speak with the press. The article reflects on how a cherished piece of American history can be reduced to anonymous construction debris, trucked away to undisclosed locations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has terminated trade negotiations with Canada, a move that trade experts warn could impact U.S. prices for cars, auto parts, and home appliances. The decision was reportedly a response to a Canadian television ad critical of tariffs that featured former President Ronald Reagan. This halt in talks could prolong the steep 35% tariffs on many Canadian goods, including the 50% levies on steel and aluminum. As these metals are key components in many consumer products, sustained tariffs are likely to increase manufacturing costs, which may then be passed on to consumers.</p>

Although vote counting is still in progress, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly in the race for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister and an independent lawmaker since 2016, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and gained the backing of several left-leaning parties.

          <p>A new report indicates that more than one-third of Manhattan condo resales between mid-2024 and mid-2025 were sold for a loss, reflecting a decade of stagnant prices in the market. While the rest of the country has seen significant home price appreciation, the median price per square foot for Manhattan condos has remained flat for ten years. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses are likely even higher. The luxury segment of the market, however, has proven to be an exception, with properties sold for over $10 million consistently yielding profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize rest, has created a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like smart mattresses, rings, and headbands. However, this reliance on tech can backfire, as demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused Eight Sleep smart beds to malfunction, trapping some users in upright positions or at extreme temperatures. While some devices can aid those with medical sleep disorders, the increasing cyborg-like dependence on technology introduces new points of failure into the simple act of sleeping. This raises questions about whether over-engineering rest is more disruptive than beneficial.</p>

This sale comes as Bezos has relocated to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez, and continues to reduce his ownership stake in Amazon, which has now fallen below 10%. The move aligns with a broader trend of him liquidating assets and diversifying his holdings.
