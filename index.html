          <p>Indebted property developer China Vanke has secured a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group to meet debt obligations. Shenzhen Metro, Vanke’s largest shareholder, is extending the loan to help cover interest and principal repayments. The loan has a 36-month term and carries an annual interest rate of 2.34 per cent. The financial support follows a government-led shake-up in February, when the southern city’s authorities tightened control over the developer by appointing 10 new executives.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. Suri, an Indian national, was arrested as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses and accused of "spreading Hamas propaganda." The judge refuted the government's claims that he had ties to Hamas through his wife, whose father was a government official in Gaza. The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings.</p>

          <p>China-Philippine relations are facing a potential shift after President Marcos failed to thwart the influence of Vice President Duterte's camp in recent elections. Observers note that Duterte, likely to survive an impeachment trial, could become a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election. Her "pragmatic" stance on China could lead to improved ties if she succeeds in the race. Candidates aligned with Marcos secured fewer Senate seats than expected, while Duterte's allies are poised to claim enough seats to potentially shield her from conviction and preserve her eligibility for the 2028 race.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly hostile approach to South Africa, marked by the welcoming of white Afrikaner refugees while halting other refugee programs, is influenced by President Trump's long-held views on white South African farmers. Trump's views were shaped by conversations with Afrikaner activists and golfer Gary Player, leading to concerns about "race-based discrimination" and the belief that Afrikaners are being persecuted. This has resulted in the suspension of foreign aid to South Africa and the expulsion of the South African ambassador. The administration's actions have been criticized as playing to white grievance and prioritizing a specific group over others in need.</p>

Many South Africans, including President Ramaphosa, view those leaving as opportunists rather than genuine refugees. However, some Afrikaners, like Ilse Steenkamp, feel persecuted due to attacks and land invasions, leading them to seek refuge in the US. The US embassy in South Africa clarified that the resettlement offer targets white South Africans who can cite past or fear of persecution.</p>

The brothers were convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, claiming self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The decision was praised by their family, who believe they are different men now, but opposed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, who argued they should not be released. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings for the brothers, after which Gov. Gavin Newsom will determine whether they should receive clemency.</p>
