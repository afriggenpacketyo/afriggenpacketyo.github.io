          <p>A federal appeals court has extended the order allowing President Trump to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, rejecting a lower court's ruling that favored California Governor Gavin Newsom. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Trump administration, stating that the president likely acted within his statutory authority under Title 10, which allows federalizing the Guard in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce U.S. laws. The court found that the administration presented sufficient facts to suggest a "colorable basis" for invoking Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents, with the panel composed of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee. The ruling allows roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to continue protecting federal property and assisting immigration agents in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers delivered a decisive 108-91 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, forcing a Game 7 in the NBA Finals. With their backs against the wall, the Pacers showcased stellar depth and stifling defense, led by Obi Toppin's 20 points off the bench and Andrew Nembhard's 17 points. The Thunder struggled with turnovers, committing 21 in total, with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander accounting for eight of them, as the Pacers capitalized with 22 fast-break points. The series now shifts back to Oklahoma City for a decisive Game 7 to determine the NBA champion; the Pacers' depth and Haliburton's performance proved crucial in extending the series.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its benchmark lending rates, following recent monetary easing measures and progress in trade relations with the U.S. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, while the 5-year LPR is steady at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. This decision comes after China reduced lending rates for the first time since October, aiming to mitigate trade tensions with the U.S. Recent agreements between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives have eased trade-war fears, allowing for tech and rare earth trade while suspending tariffs, giving Beijing room to support its currency and potentially reduce the need for aggressive fiscal stimulus.

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile retrial in Massachusetts; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. Key events included O'Keefe's death in January 2022, Read's arrest, and a mistrial in the first trial due to a hung jury, with the second trial culminating in the acquittal on major charges. The timeline includes conflicting accounts of events, such as the timing of a Google search about how long it takes to die in the cold and allegations of a coverup by law enforcement officials.</p>

          <p>An explosion occurred outside the Norwegian ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv on Thursday after a grenade was thrown into the yard; fortunately, no injuries were reported. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar spoke with Norway's Ambassador to Israel, Per Egil Selvaag, condemning the attack as a "serious and dangerous crime." The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and authorities are investigating the incident to determine the perpetrators and their reasons. This incident follows Norway's symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state last year, along with Spain and Ireland, and criticism of Israel's actions during the Gaza war, which adds a layer of complexity to potential motives.</p>

          <p>President Trump is weighing the possibility of joining Israel's attacks on Iran, particularly targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site, but is uncertain if U.S. "bunker busters" can effectively destroy the facility. Trump signaled he would decide within two weeks, amid concerns the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs might not fully eliminate the threat from Fordow, which is built deep into a mountain south of Tehran. While Israel has already targeted some of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, they lack the necessary weaponry to significantly damage the secretive site. The U.S. is the only country with bunker busters and aircraft capable of delivering them, making Trump's decision crucial.</p>

The ruling allows federal troops to remain in Los Angeles while the case is litigated, returning the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer.

The ruling blocks the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on funding related to immigration enforcement and diversity programs, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE and the congressionally approved purposes of transportation funding.

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners voiced shared security concerns at a high-level summit this week, signaling closer ties amid a turbulent global landscape. The increased engagement between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries has raised questions about Russia’s regional dominance, especially as it remains preoccupied with the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses concerns about waning influence, diplomatic observers suggest Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China’s growing influence, even as Beijing avoids directly challenging Russia as the key security guarantor in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan's core consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in May, marking the largest increase in over two years, driven by surging rice and food costs. The nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, showed the sharpest rise since January 2023, with the inflation rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, increased 7.7 percent, with rice prices jumping 101.7 percent due to supply shortages. Service prices also climbed, led by higher dining out and travel costs, while energy prices saw a slower increase compared to the previous month.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential strike against Iran's Fordo nuclear site and believes disabling it is crucial due to the risk of rapid weapons production. Trump approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, hoping Tehran will abandon its nuclear program; White House officials say a decision will come within two weeks. The president is considering the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, while active diplomacy is underway, with U.K. officials meeting with U.S. counterparts to explore a potential offer to Iran.

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, along with other national monuments, is at risk of being sold for parts or revoked due to proposed budget cuts and a shift in policy allowing presidents to shrink or revoke certain national monuments. The Justice Department has issued a legal opinion enabling presidents to revoke or shrink national monuments for the first time since the 1930s. Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could force the closure of over 300 park sites, potentially including the Till monument, which commemorates key events in the life and death of Emmett Till and the Civil Rights Movement. The Chuckwalla and Sáttítla Highlands National Monuments in California, and the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tāh Kukveni–Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument are also under consideration for revocation.</p>

The funds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing completion of construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk. While seen as a step in the right direction, some analysts caution that the allocated sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt.</p>
