            <h2>Zuckerberg Considered Spinning Off Instagram Amid Antitrust Concerns in 2018</h2>

            <p>During Meta's antitrust trial with the FTC, an email from 2018 revealed that CEO Mark Zuckerberg considered spinning off Instagram due to rising antitrust litigation concerns. Zuckerberg acknowledged the possibility of being forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp in the future. He estimated that if Instagram remained independent, it would be around the size of Twitter or Snapchat, rather than its current billion-user base. The FTC alleges Meta monopolizes social networking and seeks to cleave Instagram and WhatsApp from the company, while Meta disputes these claims, citing competition from TikTok and other apps.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's political performance, particularly concerning the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, reflects authoritarian tendencies akin to those of El Salvador's Nayib Bukele and Hungary's Viktor Orb치n. Trump's administration combines showy displays of might, as seen in the Abrego Garcia case, with subtle legal manipulations reminiscent of Orb치n's tactics. This unstable mixture risks inflaming resistance to Trump's policies, as it lacks the full strengths of either Bukele's overt strongman approach or Orb치n's covert legalism. The article suggests this strategic sloppiness may inadvertently allow American democracy to outlive his presidency.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a policy to fast-track immigration court cases, potentially denying asylum to applicants without a hearing based solely on their application forms. This directive aims to reduce the backlog of cases but raises concerns about due process, especially for those without legal representation. Experts argue that asylum cases are complex and require thorough examination beyond the initial application, as decisions can be a matter of life and death for those seeking refuge. The push to clear cases also coincides with layoffs of EOIR personnel, including judges and lawyers.</p>

            <p>Sudan's civil war continues into its third year, creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis with widespread famine and displacement. The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and over 15 million people fleeing their homes. Both sides are accused of atrocities, particularly in the Darfur region, where the RSF is accused of genocide. Despite the war's devastating impact, there has been limited international action, with donors committing only a fraction of the required funds, highlighting the urgent need for increased attention and support.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is exploring the legality of deporting U.S. citizens to prisons in Central American countries. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president is looking into the legal question and would only consider this for the most violent and egregious repeat offenders. The administration has already deported alleged foreign citizen gang members to El Salvador, where they are imprisoned. The proposal has sparked legal debate and raised concerns about the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens.</p>

Scientists, including Dr. Paul Offit, assert that the measles vaccine provides lifelong immunity. The CDC reports that 97% of measles cases in the current outbreak occur in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status.</p>
