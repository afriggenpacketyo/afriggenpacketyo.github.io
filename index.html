          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault, has died by suicide at the age of 41. Giuffre was a prominent voice against sexual abuse and sex trafficking, alleging that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, claims which Prince Andrew has denied. Her family stated that the lifelong trauma of abuse became unbearable for her. Prince Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022, expressing regret for their association but without admitting liability. Optimism score is 5 because the death was a suicide, but the victim was a well known person.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, suggesting potential concessions while maintaining some key demands. The Ukrainian plan doesn't explicitly insist on regaining all territory seized by Russia or joining NATO, hinting at possible compromises. However, it includes provisions that could be unacceptable to the Kremlin, such as no restrictions on the Ukrainian military's size and the deployment of a European security contingent backed by the U.S. to guarantee security. Frozen Russian assets would also be used to repair damage in Ukraine.</p>

The study found that a 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing motion sickness. This research is particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness.

The new sequence will consist of three numerals followed by three letters and one numeral. The accelerated depletion of the current sequence is partly attributed to increased new car registrations, driven by fears that Trump administration trade wars will increase car prices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that Russia and Ukraine are 'very close to a deal' following talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. The Kremlin described the talks as 'constructive,' although Ukraine was not present. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has emphasized the need for 'real pressure on Russia' to accept an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest Ukraine may be expected to concede territory under a US peace proposal, a notion Zelenskyy rejects.</p>

          <p>US Attorney General Pam Bondi has revoked a Biden administration-era policy that restricted subpoenas of reporters’ phone records in criminal investigations. The memo states that federal employees who leak sensitive information to the media are engaging in conduct that could be characterized as “treasonous”. This move comes as Donald Trump has escalated his attacks on the US media landscape since returning to the White House in January.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is restoring visas for hundreds of foreign students who had their legal status abruptly terminated, stoking panic among many who feared immediate deportation. Many affected students appeared to have participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges, such as driving infractions. Justice department attorney Elizabeth Kurlan told a federal court that immigration officials are now working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students.</p>
