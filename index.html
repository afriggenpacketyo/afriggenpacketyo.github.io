          <p>Tens of thousands of people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in a pro-Palestinian demonstration, calling for a ceasefire and an end to the war in Gaza. The event, which proceeded despite initial police opposition, was authorized by the Supreme Court just a day before it was scheduled. Organizers hailed the decision as "historic," while attendees, including notable public figures, braved heavy rain to participate in the peaceful protest. The march caused significant traffic disruption, and police were present to ensure public safety throughout the demonstration.</p>

          <p>The BBC has initiated an investigation after a newspaper report alleged cocaine use by two unnamed stars of its popular show, 'Strictly Come Dancing'. The claims were reportedly part of a legal submission made on behalf of a former celebrity contestant. In response, the BBC stated it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints and has hired an external law firm to assist with the probe. This follows a year of other controversies for the show, leading to the implementation of new welfare measures for its cast and crew.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have attributed a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort of Sochi to a Ukrainian drone attack. The strike, which reportedly involved drone debris hitting a fuel tank, prompted the suspension of flights at the nearby airport and required a significant firefighting response. This attack was part of a wider wave of Ukrainian drone strikes over the weekend targeting various installations in southern Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials reported that a Russian missile strike caused damage and injuries in the southern city of Mykolaiv.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting individuals who advertise illegal Channel crossings on social media, with potential penalties of up to five years in prison. This measure is part of a broader bill aimed at cracking down on migrant arrivals via small boats, which have reached record numbers this year. The new law would apply to those promoting services that breach UK immigration law, such as selling fake passports or promising illegal work. Officials believe this will grant more power to disrupt the business models of people-smuggling gangs.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is anticipated to lower interest rates this week in response to rising unemployment and the economic impact of new U.S. import tariffs. Financial markets are pricing in a high probability of a 0.25 percentage point reduction to 4.0%, which would be the fifth cut since last August. The move aims to stimulate the UK's shrinking economy, but the Monetary Policy Committee faces the challenge of high inflation, which remains well above its 2% target. New forecasts may indicate a period of stagflation is approaching. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake in the Pacific Ocean has prompted Russian officials to issue a tsunami warning for parts of the Kamchatka coast. The United States Geological Survey reported the quake at a magnitude of 7.0, with authorities warning of potential tsunami waves up to 19 centimeters. This event follows another strong earthquake and the eruption of the Krasheninnikov volcano in the same region within the last week. Officials have urged residents to move away from the shore as a precaution, although the expected wave heights are considered low.</p>

          <p>A couple in Guernsey was astonished to discover a World War II German bunker hidden beneath their property while doing renovation work. Aware that their home was on the site of a former gun emplacement, they began digging after a tip from a previous resident and unearthed the structure. The bunker, which had been sealed since the 1960s, contained two main rooms with original features like German writing on the walls. The new owners plan to convert the space into a games room and gym while preserving its historical elements.</p>

Authorities have seized thousands of fake dolls that pose a significant choking hazard to children due to easily detachable small parts. These counterfeits are often sold at a fraction of the price of the authentic dolls, which have become difficult to obtain due to high demand and scalpers.

          <p>A new climate study suggests that successful efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia over the past decade may have inadvertently accelerated global warming. The research indicates that the significant reduction in pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, has removed aerosols that were reflecting sunlight and helping to cool the planet. Scientists estimate that the clean-up efforts in the region, which have greatly improved public health, may have contributed up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the global surface warming rate since 2010, highlighting a complex environmental trade-off.</p>

A key theory revolves around two unidentified men who were seen in the shop shortly before the crime on December 6, 1991, but were never identified. Although four other men were once arrested and two were convicted, those convictions were later overturned after new DNA evidence did not match any of the suspects.
