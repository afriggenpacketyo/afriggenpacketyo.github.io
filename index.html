          <p>With America facing a shortage of affordable housing, innovative solutions are emerging, including the refitting of single-family homes into multifamily units. Developer Monte Anderson in Dallas has been converting existing homes into "roommate houses" to address the housing mismatch between large, underused homes and the demand for smaller, more affordable units. Cities and states are also exploring ways to encourage the addition of rental units to existing structures, such as allowing backyard homes and garage conversions. This approach aims to increase housing density in established neighborhoods without causing significant disruption. The article highlights the potential of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and lot subdivisions as effective strategies for adding housing supply.</p>

          <p>Marvel and Disney's latest film, 'Thunderbolts*', has garnered significant box office success, earning an estimated $162 million internationally, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. While some critics noted issues with the film's handling of sensitive topics like suicide and domestic violence, audiences have embraced the movie, giving it a high score on Rotten Tomatoes. The film features a cast of lesser-known, dysfunctional superheroes who unite to confront both human and superhuman threats. Some reviewers have praised the movie as the best Marvel has produced since WandaVision, while others see it as a self-aware step in a new direction for the studio.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is set to receive a Patriot air-defense system from Israel, which will be refurbished before delivery, as Western allies discuss the possibility of Germany or Greece providing an additional system. This comes as Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, including a deadly missile strike on Kyiv. Despite President Trump's softened rhetoric towards Ukraine and a signed minerals deal paving the way for more U.S. military aid, Ukraine continues to seek additional air defenses. The Patriot systems are crucial for defending against Russian missile attacks, but shortages have been a persistent issue.

          <p>Nicaragua has withdrawn from UNESCO after the organization awarded its press freedom prize to La Prensa, an exiled Nicaraguan newspaper. The Nicaraguan government accused La Prensa of promoting U.S. interventions. UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay expressed regret over the decision, stating it would deprive Nicaraguans of the benefits of cooperation in education and culture. This move is a setback for UNESCO, which also faced criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from the organization during his first term.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested relatives of Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician who protested against the construction of China’s new “mega-embassy” in London. Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, believes her relatives were targeted in an attempt to stop her “anti-Chinese” activities in the UK. The arrests followed a rally where Lau criticized the construction of the embassy, citing concerns over transnational repression and security risks. The new embassy, if approved, would be the country’s largest diplomatic mission in Europe.</p>
