          <p>SpaceX aims to transform a portion of the Texas coast into a company town named Starbase, raising concerns among local residents about access to Boca Chica Beach and environmental impacts. SpaceX has submitted a petition to Texas to create a new town with its own services, but residents fear restricted beach access and increased pollution from rocket launches. While SpaceX seeks permits for up to 25 annual launches, locals worry about the disruption to their community and the potential loss of a cherished natural resource. The article highlights the tension between SpaceX's ambitious goals and the concerns of residents who have long called the area home, citing potential violations of the state's Open Beaches Act.</p>

The judge ordered Jeffries to be hospitalized for treatment to determine if his mental condition improves. The article provides context on the charges against Jeffries, which involve allegations of luring men to drug-fueled sex parties.</p>

The antivenom has shown protection against multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.
