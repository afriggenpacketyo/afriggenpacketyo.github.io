          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is set to announce a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet. The changes are intended to mark the next phase of the party's policy renewal and emphasize unity under its new leadership. Former leadership contender and Home Secretary, Sir James Cleverly, is expected to make a prominent return to the front bench. This move is being framed as a strategic effort to challenge the current Labour government more effectively.</p>

          <p>A small Norwegian town, Ulefoss, is located above Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, which are critical for modern technology and green energy. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway, plans an "invisible mine" to extract these resources, potentially reducing the EU's dependency on China. While the project promises economic benefits and has some local support due to the town's mining history, residents express significant concerns about environmental impact and the risk of ground subsidence.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a figure higher than anticipated by economists. According to the Office for National Statistics, this represents the second-highest June borrowing amount on record, primarily driven by increased debt interest payments and spending on public services. This rise in expenditure has outpaced the revenue generated from taxes, including the recent increases in National Insurance Contributions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia has dramatically increased its use of long-range drones, launching nightly swarms to terrorize Ukrainian cities and strike various targets across the country. Having boosted domestic production and upgraded Iranian Shahed designs, Moscow is now deploying hundreds of drones in single attacks, a number expected to rise. This strategy aims to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and inflict maximum damage ahead of a potential ceasefire deadline, turning drone warfare into a central element of the conflict.</p>

She argues that this tacit condition rests on a belief that the region is a "lesser place" defined by tragedy, limiting the scope of stories that get translated and published. The author calls for publishers to embrace a more diverse range of narratives from the region, ones that challenge stereotypes and present universal themes without a mandatory "self-exoticising twist."</p>

          <p>North Korea has announced its intention to build a third 5,000-ton destroyer for its navy, with a target completion date of October 2026. This plan follows the launch of its first such vessel in April and the capsizing and subsequent repair of a second one in May. The announcement was made at a rally where workers pledged to uphold the ruling party's plan for building a powerful military and defending the nation's maritime sovereignty, continuing the country's naval expansion efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people. The move follows a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." The changes, which will cost an additional £1 billion, aim to restore trust and better address the harm caused, though victims' groups have cautiously welcomed the news while noting some issues still require further consultation.</p>

          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has surged by £221 over the past three years. This sharp 21% increase is attributed to high tenant demand and an insufficient supply of available rental properties. While the rate of increase has recently started to slow, the high costs are forcing some renters to turn down jobs and rely on financial help from parents to cover their living expenses.
