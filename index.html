          <p>The French government is moving to deport a Palestinian student from Sciences Po Lille for allegedly sharing an antisemitic post that included an image of Adolf Hitler and called for violence against Jews. In response to the incident, France has also suspended all evacuations of individuals from Gaza, pending a full investigation into how the student obtained a visa. Top French officials have condemned the post, stating that glorifying terrorism and antisemitism has no place in the country. The controversy arises as France plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a move that has already created diplomatic friction.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has commented on the possibility of pardoning Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was recently convicted on two prostitution-related charges. In a Newsmax interview, Trump described Combs as “sort of half-innocent” but noted that a pardon would be “more difficult” due to Combs's past hostile statements, including a 2020 remark that “white men like Trump need to be banished.” Trump acknowledged that while personal feelings shouldn't cloud judgment, the past criticism makes the decision challenging. Combs is currently awaiting sentencing for flying individuals across the country for sexual encounters.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, assuring them of his and President Trump's commitment to securing the release of their loved ones. The meeting occurred during a protest where families urged the Israeli government to prioritize a deal for the remaining captives, whose well-being is a growing concern nearly 22 months into the war. Witkoff's visit follows his recent withdrawal from ceasefire talks, citing Hamas's intransigence. Meanwhile, violence continues near humanitarian aid distribution sites in Gaza, with reports of civilians being killed while seeking food.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe highlights the significant difference in rental space available for a $1,500 monthly budget across major U.S. cities. For that price, a renter in Manhattan can only afford an average of 216 square feet, while someone in Wichita, Kansas, can get 1,329 square feet. The least amount of space is typically found in expensive coastal markets like New York, Boston, and San Francisco, where housing demand far outpaces supply. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South, such as Toledo, Ohio, and Oklahoma City, offer the most spacious accommodations for the same price.</p>

          <p>A 76-year-old man, Jon Ruben, has been arrested and charged with child cruelty in England for allegedly distributing candy laced with a sedative to boys at a summer camp. The incident occurred at Stathern Lodge, a facility north of London, where eight boys and one adult were hospitalized as a precaution after falling ill; all have since been discharged. Ruben was detained at a nearby pub and faces three charges of willfully ill-treating children in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering.

The report showed only 73,000 new jobs and included a large downward revision for the previous two months, which the president called a "major mistake" and suggested was politically motivated. The move has drawn sharp criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who argue it undermines the independence of federal data agencies and politicizes crucial economic information.

The special delves into topics ranging from his father's dementia to a past instance of childhood sexual trauma, using them as springboards for his signature brand of cantankerous and self-reflective humor. The article notes that while Maron's temperament has softened over the years, his comedic style remains consistent, focusing on emotional vulnerability and excavating humor from difficult subjects.

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay over $240 million in damages, finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot technology that resulted in one death and serious injuries. The case centered on a driver who, while admittedly distracted, crashed at high speed, but plaintiffs argued Tesla's technology failed and the term "Autopilot" was misleading. Lawyers for the victims also claimed Tesla hid key evidence, which was later uncovered by a forensic expert. Tesla has called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal, arguing it sets back automotive safety innovation.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to €3,248, a figure that far exceeds the average pension and creates significant financial strain for many elderly citizens. This sharp increase is attributed to higher wages for nursing staff and an increase in staffing levels. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system, as the current model is becoming unsustainable. Experts suggest solutions could include introducing federal tax subsidies or requiring higher earners to contribute more to the system.</p>

This finding contradicts the narrative pushed by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has sought to prove a “treasonous conspiracy” by the Obama administration.

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town once in decline, has experienced a revival largely thanks to the arrival of immigrants who have opened businesses and revitalized neighborhoods. However, this progress is now threatened by an aggressive immigration crackdown, with the local Butler County jail, run by an outspoken anti-immigration sheriff, primarily housing detainees on immigration charges. The detention of a respected local imam has further stoked fear and anger, emblematic of a national split over immigration policy. The situation highlights the tension between the economic and cultural benefits of immigration and the harsh realities of current enforcement strategies.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is pursuing several strategies to secure her release from a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking ring. Her legal team is simultaneously petitioning the Supreme Court, seeking clemency from the Trump administration, and engaging in discussions with the Justice Department, where she recently met with the deputy attorney general. Legal experts suggest this multi-pronged approach is a sound, if long-shot, strategy to better her legal position. The move comes as President Trump faces renewed scrutiny over his own connections to Epstein, creating a complex political and legal landscape.</p>

          <p>China has funded and built a satellite data receiving ground station near Namibia's capital, Windhoek, marking a significant step in its space-related cooperation with African nations. The facility, described by the Chinese embassy as a "shining example" of partnership, will help Namibia with environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource assessment. As part of the collaboration, China will also provide technical training to Namibian engineers to ensure the country can operate the station independently. The project underscores China's expanding influence in the global space industry by helping African countries develop their own technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>A Little League team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was unable to compete in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina after being denied travel visas to the United States. The team of 13- to 16-year-olds had won the Latin American qualifying tournament but was barred from entry under a Trump administration proclamation restricting travel from several countries. While exemptions exist for major sporting events, it is unclear why they were not granted in this case. The league's president stated the young players are demoralized, as they pose no threat and only wanted to play baseball.</p>

The 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses. The incident in June, claimed by the since-proscribed group Palestine Action, caused an estimated £7 million in damage after activists spray-painted the planes. The break-in prompted a government security review of all UK military bases and led to Palestine Action being designated a terrorist organization, a move its founder is now legally challenging.</p>

However, Elliott, an experienced activist investor with deep knowledge of the data center industry, likely views the spending as a necessary response to long-term demand driven by AI and hyperscaler growth. Elliott may push for improved market communication, cost structure optimization, and other changes to amplify shareholder returns at the company. (not investment advice)</p>

The aircraft, a 737-200 operated by Venezuelan airline Venezolana, was built in 1978 and is believed to be the oldest Boeing passenger jet in active, regularly scheduled commercial service. After flying for Frontier and United Airlines, it was stored in the desert for a decade before being brought back into service in 2011. While showing its age, the jet's longevity is a testament to the durability of its original design.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should persistently connect President Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to expose him as a protector of powerful elites at the expense of ordinary people. The author suggests that Trump's flustered responses and the administration's actions, such as visiting Ghislaine Maxwell, reveal a vulnerability that Democrats can exploit. The recommended strategy is to repeat the message that Trump's protection of his friends in the Epstein circle is part of a broader pattern of favoring the rich. This narrative, it is argued, can resonate with voters who already feel the system is rigged for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen the Alcatraz prison has been met with strong opposition from Indigenous leaders, who call it an attempt to erase the island's significant history as a site of Native American resistance. After the federal prison closed in 1963, Indigenous activists occupied Alcatraz for 19 months, a pivotal event that spurred major positive shifts in federal policy toward Native sovereignty. Leaders argue that using the site for immigrant detention is not only logistically absurd but also an affront to this legacy of resistance. They see it as a painful echo of the historical displacement and violence committed against their communities.</p>

          <p>Following his treatment for bladder cancer, football coach Deion Sanders received a neobladder, a reconstructed organ built by surgeons using a segment of his own small intestine. Urologic surgeons explain that the procedure involves removing the cancerous bladder and fashioning a new, spherical reservoir from intestinal tissue, which is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the neobladder is made from the patient's own body, there is no risk of rejection. Sanders has been open about the challenges of adjusting to the new organ, particularly incontinence, helping to reduce the stigma associated with the condition.</p>
