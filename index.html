          <p>President Trump has accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a now-deleted social media post containing the numbers '8647'. Trump claims Comey knew the post meant 'assassination', asserting that Comey, as a former FBI director, should have understood the implications. Comey has stated that he did not intend any violence or threat, and that he simply thought the message in the shells placement was political. Trump fired Comey in his first administration, and he alleges that Comey still harbors resentment towards him.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of the weight loss drug Wegovy, announced that CEO Lars Jorgensen will step down by 'mutual agreement' due to 'recent market challenges' and a significant decline in the company's share price. This decision follows a downgraded sales and profits forecast and a more than 50% drop in the company's shares since mid-2024. The company attributed the challenges to cheaper replica drugs produced by compounding pharmacies and a study showing that people lost more weight using Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Jorgensen will remain as CEO during the transition period.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is considering a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales, with less than six months to live, to seek assistance in ending their lives. Members of Parliament voted to allow health workers to opt out of participating in assisted dying, but ran out of time to vote on other amendments, including preventing medical staff from raising the option with patients first. The debate was emotionally charged, with strong opinions expressed on both sides regarding safeguards, coercion, and the potential impact on vulnerable individuals. The government remains neutral on the bill, allowing MPs a free vote based on their conscience.</p>

The letters will be sent by the Treasury Secretary and Commerce Secretary, detailing what nations will pay to do business in the United States. This move follows recent negotiations with major trading partners regarding the April 2 tariffs, which set historically high duties on imported goods. Retailers like Walmart have warned that these tariffs will lead to price hikes for American consumers, despite some easing of tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>Shares of Richemont, the owner of Cartier, surged 7% after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division.

However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators took place in Istanbul, marking the first such meeting since the start of the war, but ended after less than two hours. While expectations for a breakthrough were low, the meeting was viewed as a tactical win for Putin, who managed to initiate talks without agreeing to a ceasefire. Despite initially supporting the talks, Trump later suggested that nothing meaningful would happen until he met with Putin personally. Skeptics suggest Putin may be using the talks to convince Trump that Ukraine is the obstacle to peace.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that a growing number of Americans cannot afford a basic standard of living, considering costs beyond necessities like food and shelter. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a 'minimal quality of life' is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The report also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates the level of economic distress, with a 'functionally unemployed' rate topping 24% when factoring in poverty-wage workers and those unable to find full-time employment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East visit resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These deals involve American chip giants Nvidia and AMD, who will now be allowed to sell advanced chips to these countries for their AI initiatives. However, the deals have raised concerns from security hawks in both U.S. political parties, who fear the technology could fall into the wrong hands. This has prompted discussions within the Trump administration about potentially pausing the deals.</p>
