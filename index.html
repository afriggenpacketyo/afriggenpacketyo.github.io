          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España cycling race was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers, leading to clashes with police and the cancellation of the podium ceremony. The decision was made for safety reasons, following a series of protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team throughout the multi-stage race. Race leader Jonas Vingegaard was declared the winner without the traditional final day of racing and celebrations in the Spanish capital.</p>

The article alleges that during his time on Capitol Hill, Republican staffers spread rumors that he played with porcelain dolls to undermine him. Now in the White House, he is reportedly known by nicknames like "President Miller" for his control over agencies like the Department of Homeland Security. The piece also recounts claims of Miller's past animosity towards Latinos and his push for aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has shared new details about the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, noting the suspect's ideology differed from his conservative family. The 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, was reportedly in a relationship with a partner who is transitioning from male to female. The governor stated that Robinson was not cooperating with authorities but that information was being gathered from those close to him, who indicated he was deeply involved in "dark places of the internet." The investigation continues to explore a motive for the attack at Utah Valley University.</p>

          <p>The recent fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a state law permitting open carry of firearms on college campuses. The law, passed in August, allows individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry guns at universities, a change from the previous concealment requirement. While the suspect's legal right to possess the rifle used is unclear, the incident has highlighted the state's permissive gun legislation. Critics point out that such laws may be inadequate to deter politically motivated violence from individuals who are not rational actors.</p>

          <p>Romania's defense ministry has reported that a Russian drone violated its airspace, making it the second NATO country to report such an incident recently. The drone was tracked near the Ukrainian border on Saturday while Romanian fighter jets were monitoring Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. This follows a similar event where Poland reported shooting down at least three Russian drones that entered its airspace. The incursions have heightened tensions along NATO's eastern flank, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling the Romanian incident an "obvious expansion of the war."</p>

          <p>A feature article explores the increasingly complex and expensive world of modern theme parks, using Universal's new Epic Universe as an example. To compete with digital entertainment, parks are creating hyper-immersive worlds and physically intense rides that push the limits of engineering and the human body. The article details how operators meticulously manage visitor experiences, from using architectural "wienies" to guide crowds to installing bathrooms in queues to manage long waits. This engineered fun aims to overwhelm the senses and provide an escape that cannot be replicated on a screen.</p>

          <p>The family of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly called for a full investigation into Prince Andrew over her allegations of sexual abuse. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, stated that the Duke of York has not faced sufficient consequences and should be held to the fullest extent of the law. Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, alleged Prince Andrew abused her on three occasions when she was a minor. The prince has always denied the claims and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 without any admission of liability.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right CDU is projected to finish first. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has made substantial gains, tripling its share of the vote to 16.5% compared to 5.1% in 2020. The results are seen as a test for the national government, indicating a continued rightward shift in the German electorate. Meanwhile, the Green Party experienced a significant drop in support, falling from 20% in the previous election to around 11.7%.</p>

          <h2>Banks and Credit Card Companies Grow Wary of Popular 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is causing concern for traditional banks and credit card companies. These services, which allow consumers to pay for purchases in interest-free installments, are seen as a direct competitor to credit card revenue streams. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage is often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert called a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of visibility makes it harder for lenders to accurately assess a borrower's overall debt and risk.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Israel for discussions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a visit aimed at managing diplomatic fallout from recent Israeli actions. Tensions have risen following an Israeli missile strike in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders, which reportedly angered the Trump administration and U.S. allies in the Arab world. Rubio's visit is intended to convey U.S. priorities while reaffirming broad support for Israeli security. The trip also occurs as Israel faces international criticism for its military operations in Gaza and settlement expansion in the West Bank.</p>
