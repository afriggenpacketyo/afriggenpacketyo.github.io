          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani sustained multiple broken bones after the vehicle he was in was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. His spokesperson confirmed injuries including fractured thoracic vertebrae, lacerations, and contusions, noting they are non-life-threatening. The incident occurred shortly after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who was a victim of domestic violence, and authorities have stated the crash was not a targeted attack. The 19-year-old driver of the other vehicle and Giuliani's associate were also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>

          <p>China's shipbuilding industry has expanded at an extraordinary rate, now possessing a capacity that is reportedly 200 times greater than that of the United States. This rapid growth has enabled the Chinese Communist Party to build the world's largest navy by number of vessels, operating 234 warships compared to the U.S. Navy's 219. While the U.S. fleet still holds advantages in overall tonnage and advanced carriers, the narrowing gap raises significant strategic concerns for Washington. The article highlights how China's 'military-civilian fusion' policy allows commercial shipyards to contribute to naval production, providing a key advantage in any prolonged conflict.</p>

The 54-year-old parliamentarian, known for his key role in the 2014 Euromaidan protests, was fatally shot in Lviv by an assailant disguised as a courier. According to the interior minister, the investigation suggests the assassination was carefully planned, with the attacker having mapped out Parubiy's schedule and escape route. The suspect was detained in the Khmelnytskyi region, and further details are expected from the national police force.</p>

          <p>Actor Orlando Bloom discussed the severe physical and mental toll of losing 52 pounds for his role as a boxer in the upcoming movie "The Cut." Bloom admitted to being 'hangry,' exhausted, and paranoid, describing himself as a 'horrible person' to be around during the process. He followed a grueling regimen supervised by a nutritionist, which eventually had him eating only tuna and cucumber for the final three weeks. The actor explained that while the transformation was intense and something he would not recommend, it ultimately enhanced his performance by allowing him to genuinely feel his character's struggles.</p>

Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and does not intend to sign a new one, scored in Palace's recent 3-0 victory over Aston Villa. Glasner emphasized that Guehi is a crucial player and that the club has no chance of finding a suitable replacement before the transfer window closes.

The court found that Trump had overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs.

This action follows a diplomatic row sparked by the arrest of a pro-Egyptian government activist during a protest in London last week. The Egyptian government had demanded an explanation for the arrest and asserted its right to a reciprocal response. The UK Foreign Office stated the closure is to review the impact of the changes, while it engages with Egyptian officials regarding the security of the embassy and its staff.</p>

          <h2>Donald Trump Announces Plan for Executive Order Mandating Voter ID</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order that would require identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move widely expected to face immediate legal challenges as unconstitutional. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states the authority to regulate elections, with no explicit power given to the president in this area. This push is rooted in Trump's unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue that strict voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise minority, low-income, and elderly voters, and a previous attempt by Trump to require proof of citizenship was blocked by federal courts.</p>

          <p>Residents of Southern California are experiencing a sweltering Labor Day weekend heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 107 degrees in some inland areas. While many are heading to the coast for relief, the National Weather Service has issued a beach hazards statement, warning of dangerous rip currents and high surf up to six feet. The highest risk is on south-facing shores in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Forecasters are also monitoring a chance of thunderstorms later in the week, which could bring the threat of lightning-sparked fires amid the hot, dry conditions.</p>

          <p>After a 2-1 loss to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season since 2004, raising concerns about their ability to challenge for the title. Despite significant summer spending and the return of key midfielder Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency reminiscent of last season's trophyless campaign. No team in the 38-game era has recovered from such a poor start to win the league. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team 'forgot to play' after conceding, but urged patience, stating the season has just begun.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's improvisational and contradictory policy on the Russia-Ukraine war creates dangerous instability and benefits Vladimir Putin. The author contends that while Trump may see himself as a peacemaker, his actions suggest a lack of strategy, allowing Putin to exploit the confusion and prolong the conflict. The piece suggests that unless Trump adopts a clear and forceful policy to coerce Putin, he risks enabling a Russian victory and cementing the decline of U.S. global influence. True leadership, it argues, requires more than headline-chasing and unpredictability.</p>
