          <p>The Social Security Administration's proposed changes, including job cuts and stricter identity checks, are worrying advocates.  These changes could make it harder for seniors and people with disabilities to access benefits, potentially leading to severe consequences, as illustrated by one individual's struggle to help his mother receive her benefits. Critics fear these actions will undermine public support for Social Security.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's efforts to broker a swift ceasefire in Ukraine are proving more difficult than anticipated.  His reliance on personal diplomacy and a two-stage negotiation strategy have yielded limited results, with Vladimir Putin expressing opposition to a rushed settlement.  The conflict's complexity and Putin's unwillingness to be pressured contribute to the slow progress.</p>
