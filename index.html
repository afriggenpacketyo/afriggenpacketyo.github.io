          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement. Federal authorities allege she intentionally misdirected agents away from an undocumented immigrant in her courtroom earlier this month. Judge Dugan, known for her progressive views, denies the charges and vows to defend herself, asserting her commitment to the rule of law and due process. She was elected in 2016 and re-elected unopposed in 2022, with her current term expiring in 2028.</p>

          <p>BBC Verify examined claims by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) that it has saved billions in US government spending. Doge claims to have saved an average of more than $10 billion a week since President Trump entered office, focusing on cancelling contracts and tackling fraud. However, BBC Verify's analysis found a lack of evidence to support these figures, with accounting errors and overstated savings identified. For example, Doge claimed $2.9 billion in savings from cancelling a contract for a facility housing migrant children, but the actual savings were estimated to be around $153 million.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley, concerning its foreign funding, focusing on potential undisclosed financial ties.

          <p>An upcoming mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to provide a temporary boost to nature, with migratory birds arriving and butterflies emerging.

However, wildlife charities caution against the increased risk of wildfires due to dry conditions, urging the public to be vigilant.

          <p>Sale secured a 25-7 victory over Saracens in a Premiership rugby match, moving up to second in the table. Sale dominated the first half with tries from Ma'asi-White and Ford, along with a remarkable individual effort from Reed. Saracens scored a try in the second half, but Sale maintained control throughout the match. The referee's decision to blow his whistle prematurely prevented Sale from securing a bonus point.

          <p>The Trump administration is reversing its policy of terminating visas for foreign students, restoring their legal status after widespread criticism and lawsuits. The administration had abruptly revoked the visas of hundreds of students, many of whom had participated in political protests or had minor criminal charges. The Justice Department informed a federal court that it is working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas, while maintaining the authority to revoke status for other reasons. The policy reversal provides relief for many students who feared deportation.</p>

          <p>California regulators have released a proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads. The proposed regulations would permit testing of trucks over 10,001lbs, opening the door for companies to test autonomous technology on larger vehicles. The regulations are subject to a public comment period and are likely to face opposition from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job losses. The proposal aims to enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers and give the DMV more enforcement authority.</p>

The White House disputes the analysis, but the PSP maintains that the costs will grow as other DOGE cuts take effect.

The merger is complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS over a '60 Minutes' interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The staff fears that the company may settle the lawsuit with an apology and payment to Trump, potentially undermining the program's independence and ability to aggressively cover the Trump White House. The show has a long history of operating independently and the departure of Owens was likely due to the additional oversight implemented in recent months.</p>
