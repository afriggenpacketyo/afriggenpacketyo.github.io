            <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares experienced a nearly 5% increase following the announcement that Elliott Investment Management had acquired a stake exceeding $1.5 billion in the company. The activist investor intends to engage HPE in discussions aimed at enhancing shareholder value. This development occurs against a backdrop of HPE's stock losing over a quarter of its value this year, despite the company surpassing quarterly revenue expectations but issuing weak fiscal full-year guidance due to higher discounting and anticipated price adjustments.

            <p>A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that the U.S. is vulnerable to China's export controls on rare earth elements, which are crucial for defense technologies. With China holding a monopoly over heavy rare earths processing, the U.S. would be unable to fill a potential shortfall, threatening military capabilities. The Department of Defense aims to develop a complete domestic supply chain by 2027, but CSIS notes that even when facilities are operational, their output will fall short of China's, leaving the U.S. on the back foot for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>The Netflix miniseries *Adolescence* explores the potential for a seemingly normal teenager to be drawn into violence through online influences. The show raises questions about monitoring children's device use and social media, and highlights the challenges of online bullying. Jonathan Haidt, author of *The Anxious Generation*, discusses the importance of delaying smartphone use until high school and promoting phone-free schools to mitigate the negative impacts of social media on teenagers. He also notes the changing nature of bullying and the potential for addiction and radicalization among boys.</p>

            <p>With economic uncertainty due to tariffs, some Americans are considering keeping physical cash at home for emergencies. While not all financial planners deem it essential, some recommend a small amount for power outages, natural disasters, or payment disruptions. Experts suggest a range of $300 to $1,000, cautioning against hoarding excessive amounts, as it's not FDIC-insured and doesn't earn interest. They also advise discretion and recommend prioritizing emergency savings in insured accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Shares of LVMH plunged after an unexpected decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to rival Hermès. The decline was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China for cognac, as well as geopolitical tensions. The luxury sector, reliant on global supply chains and U.S. consumer demand, is facing headwinds from volatile trade policies. LVMH spent several years as Europe's most valuable company starting with 2021, as luxury stocks were buoyed by hopes of a post-Covid-19 pandemic boom. (not investment advice)</p>

Adoption UK said the news was “distressing” for families, who had already faced “an agonizing wait” to find out whether the adoption and special guardian support fund would continue. The government said the move would “ensure the fund is financially sustainable to allow more vulnerable children to access targeted support”.

The man was shed hunting — or searching for antlers naturally shed by deer, elk and other animals at this time of year — when he first saw the bear on a brushy hillside in north-Central Montana on Friday. The agency said no action will be taken regarding the yearling cub. Grizzly bear populations are becoming more dense and widespread in the state, Montana FWP said.</p>
