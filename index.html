          <p>President Trump traveled to Central Texas to assess the devastation from recent historic flooding that has resulted in 121 deaths and over 170 missing people. The visit focused on Kerr County, where a girls' summer camp suffered catastrophic losses with at least 27 campers and counselors killed. The president met with local officials, first responders, and some affected families to discuss recovery efforts. Mr. Trump has signed a disaster declaration for the region, enabling federal support for the ongoing search and rescue operations.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album, his first in four years, but it has garnered lukewarm reviews from music critics. Reviewers noted some brilliant moments but found the album to be an inconsistent and unfiltered project, pointing to self-pitying spoken-word tracks and saccharine lyrics. While some appreciated the nostalgic R&B sound, others described it as confirmation of artistic lethargy, caught between themes of sex, God, and personal grievances. The release follows a period of fan concern over Bieber's mental state and public life.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold approximately $36.4 million in company stock as part of a pre-arranged trading plan. This sale occurs as Nvidia's stock continues to surge due to its dominance in the AI chip market, recently becoming the first company to exceed a $4 trillion market capitalization. Huang's personal net worth has soared to $143 billion, placing him in close competition with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The continued investor confidence in AI has dramatically increased both Huang's wealth and Nvidia's market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has expressed his opposition to the NFL's proposal to extend the regular season to 18 games. He cited the physical toll on players and the increased risk of injuries, which could prevent top athletes from participating in crucial late-season games. Mahomes suggested that if the league proceeds with the expansion, it must incorporate additional bye weeks to allow for adequate player recovery. The potential schedule change is partly motivated by the desire to align the Super Bowl with President’s Day weekend.</p>

          <p>High-yield savings accounts remain an attractive option for savers, with interest rates significantly higher than traditional accounts. A major advantage is the ability to earn substantial interest while maintaining flexible access to funds, which is crucial amid economic uncertainty.

Furthermore, the best rates are typically offered by online-only banks, which may be a downside for those who prefer traditional in-person banking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is pushing to secure an agreement on its new 2040 climate target by September, though the plan faces opposition from several member states. The European Commission has proposed a 90% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels, a goal that has created political friction. While most countries support the timeline, nations like Poland and Hungary argue that more time is needed to consider the profound economic impacts. The debate highlights the challenge of balancing ambitious climate action with economic concerns like defense spending and industrial support.</p>

          <p>Doctors at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, Gaza's largest operational hospital, are warning of an imminent disaster as an expanding Israeli offensive and critical fuel shortages threaten to shut down all services. The hospital was forced to stop admitting new patients after Israeli tanks advanced nearby, firing on the area. With fuel for generators nearly depleted, dozens of patients in intensive care are at immediate risk of death. The dire situation is compounded by a severe lack of medical supplies and exhausted staff working around the clock to treat overwhelming numbers of trauma patients.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" temporarily increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 but includes a phaseout that could create a tax shock for some high earners. The benefit begins to decrease for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000 and is completely eliminated at $600,000. Tax professionals warn this creates a "SALT torpedo," where income earned within that $100,000 window could be taxed at an effective federal rate as high as 45.5%. This occurs because individuals are simultaneously pushed into a higher income bracket while losing a significant deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UEFA has demoted Crystal Palace from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League for the upcoming season due to a breach of multi-club ownership regulations. The ruling stems from American businessman John Textor's ownership stakes in both Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Under UEFA rules, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same competition, and Lyon was given precedence due to its higher domestic league finish. Crystal Palace, which qualified by winning the FA Cup, intends to appeal the decision.</p>

In California, nearly 40% of households are "cost-burdened," spending over a third of their income on housing. States like Florida and Louisiana have seen their rankings worsen dramatically due to an insurance crisis driven by severe weather, making them increasingly expensive for residents.

          <p>Virginia has fallen from its number one spot in an annual ranking of top states for business, largely due to the economic impact of federal workforce reductions under the Trump administration. As a state with a high percentage of federal employees and contractors, Virginia's economy is particularly vulnerable to these cuts. The state's unemployment rate ticked up in May, and economists forecast a loss of over 30,000 jobs this year, creating a ripple effect in local sectors.

          <p>Amid debates over IVF and declining birth rates, a significant part of the fertility equation, male infertility, is often overlooked in policy discussions. Infertility in heterosexual couples stems from male factors as often as female ones, yet men are frequently not evaluated, and their treatments are less likely to be covered by insurance. This places a disproportionate medical and emotional burden on women, who undergo invasive procedures like IVF even when the issue is with their partner. Experts suggest that expanding access to male-specific fertility care could offer a less invasive, politically viable way to address falling birth rates.</p>
