          <p>Buffalo Trace Distillery, America's oldest-running distillery, has reopened in time for the Kentucky Derby after being shut down due to historic flooding. The Kentucky River rose to over 48 feet, inundating the 400-acre campus with several feet of water. Despite the damage, crews worked quickly to restore operations, ensuring the distillery could welcome visitors and provide bourbon for the Derby celebrations, marking a step forward for a community still recovering from the disaster.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," suggests that the process of selecting a new Pope shares similarities with the TV show "The Traitors," highlighting the dynamic of participants trying to identify those who are deceptive. Harris believes the conclave's ancient, secretive ritual is a brilliant device for selecting a leader, a process that political parties could learn from. However, he also questions the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections, suggesting it is an outdated practice for a modern religion.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending an accredited private school with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools, with State Senator Jo Brown stating that the bill "is not about choice" and a "private-school payday at the expense of public-school children."</p>
