          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, has declared that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions is "done," having successfully brought inflation down from its peak. While the primary goal of taming the 2021-2022 price shocks is considered complete, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared for new economic shocks and potential future rate adjustments. Other officials echoed this sentiment, suggesting that any further moves would likely be rate cuts to support a slow-growing Eurozone economy, with risks now tilted to the downside.

This stance is reportedly driven by the belief that Andrew remains a significant "reputational risk" and threat to the monarchy due to his controversial associations. Experts claim William, as a future king, is focused on modernizing the institution and sees no place for scandal-plagued figures, a position that his father, King Charles, is said to support while maintaining a private familial relationship with his brother.</p>

This move comes as China's anti-dumping investigation into European brandy approaches a July 5 deadline, after which steep tariffs could become permanent. To qualify for the refund, the French companies must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices, with a leading industry group confirming that a preliminary agreement has been negotiated pending final approval.</p>

          <p>The British government has launched a "landmark" review of its parental leave and pay policies, aiming to modernize a system that campaigners and MPs have criticized as outdated and flawed. The review will examine statutory maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have not been significantly reformed in decades. Acknowledging low uptake of shared and paternity leave, often due to affordability issues, the government intends to address the system's complexity and lack of generosity compared to other developed nations, a move praised by advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly drop since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This decline is potentially linked to weaker demand following recent changes to stamp duty rules that reduced tax relief for many homebuyers. Despite the monthly dip, annual price growth stood at 2.1%, its slowest rate in nearly a year. Economists suggest the market softness is temporary and expect activity to rebound, supported by low unemployment and earnings growth outpacing inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

With Tillis announcing he won't seek reelection, his North Carolina seat becomes a potential pickup for Democrats, which could threaten the GOP's legislative agenda and the confirmation of judicial nominees, effectively stalling the Trump presidency if the Senate is lost.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties pending a full review of an ethics case against her. The case stems from a leaked phone call with a former Cambodian leader, which sparked public anger and accusations that she undermined the Thai military. Paetongtarn, the latest member of the powerful Shinawatra clan to face political turmoil, will be temporarily replaced by a deputy as the court considers her potential dismissal, a move that could further destabilize her already fragile ruling coalition.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Freezes Billions in Federal Education Funding, Harming State Programs</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to withhold an estimated $6.8 billion in federally appropriated education funds from states, including over $800 million from California. The frozen funds were designated for programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, and aid for English learners and migrant students. State education leaders, like California's Tony Thurmond, have condemned the action as illegal, warning that it will cause immediate harm as school districts had already budgeted for this money and hired staff based on its expected arrival for the new fiscal year.</p>
