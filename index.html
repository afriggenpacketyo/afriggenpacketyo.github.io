          <p>France has denied allegations made by Telegram founder Pavel Durov regarding interference in Romania's presidential election, dismissing them as "completely unfounded." The French Foreign Ministry stated that the claims were a diversionary tactic from real threats of interference by Russia, referencing the annulled first round of elections due to electoral violations. The ministry also emphasized France's support for Romania's EU accession and military assistance. This denial underscores the tensions surrounding the integrity of democratic processes in Romania and the broader geopolitical context of foreign influence. </p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating the collision of a Mexican navy training ship, CuauhtÃ©moc, with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries. The ship reportedly lost power and drifted backward into the bridge while sailors were performing a ceremonial departure, snapping all three masts. Senator Schumer is questioning whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have played a role, specifically citing a potential lack of functionality in the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service (VTS) due to staffing limitations.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list, marking the end of an era. Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year, $60-million contract, had seen his production decline, leading to the emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim. This move follows the release of Austin Barnes and represents a shift towards younger, more productive players. Taylor, once a key player for the Dodgers, struggled to regain his form after elbow surgery, leading to his departure.</p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum discusses Desi Arnaz's impact on Hollywood, highlighting how he challenged racial norms and pushed for diversity in the 1950s. Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, faced skepticism from network executives who doubted the public would accept a Latino as the husband of Lucille Ball on television. Through his talent and determination, Arnaz not only secured his role but also revolutionized television production and business models. His success paved the way for greater Latino representation in pop culture, offering an instructive example for performers and institutions striving for inclusion today.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East diplomacy has largely sidelined Israel, with the president engaging with new leaders and negotiating deals without involving Prime Minister Netanyahu. Trump's recent actions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing a cease-fire in Yemen, diverge from Israel's preferences and priorities. This shift underscores a new dynamic in the region, where economic and strategic interests with Gulf nations take precedence. Despite assurances of continued U.S. support for Israel, the changing diplomatic landscape has raised concerns among Israeli officials.</p>

While Iran argues for its right to enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Mr. Witkoff appears to be seeking a middle ground.
