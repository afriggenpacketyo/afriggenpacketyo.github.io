The bill increases the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for certain taxpayers and accelerates work requirements for Medicaid. However, major indexes fell due to concerns about the bill's impact on federal deficits and long-term fiscal health. Democrats oppose the bill, arguing it disproportionately benefits higher-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court effectively ended a publicly funded Catholic charter school in Oklahoma due to a 4-4 tie vote. The decision upholds an Oklahoma court ruling that invalidated the approval of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. The Catholic Church had sought taxpayer funding for the online charter school, while opponents argued it would violate the separation of church and state. The issue could return to the high court in the future with all nine justices participating.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill approved by the House does not include President Trump's proposal to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits. This is due to rules prohibiting changes to Social Security through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes an additional $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older, effective from 2025 to 2029, with income thresholds. Experts warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>
