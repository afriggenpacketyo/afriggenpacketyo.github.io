          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth cautioned that the U.S. is prepared to "fight and win" against China if deterrence fails, emphasizing the need for Asian allies to strengthen military coordination and increase their defense spending. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth highlighted Washington's commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and criticized China's military pressure in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. He also vowed to counter China's influence over the Panama Canal, asserting U.S. control over the key terrain. Hegseth's remarks reflect increasing trade frictions and broader geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. Optimism is tempered by the serious nature of the potential conflict. </p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery, citing her as a "highly partisan person" and a supporter of DEI initiatives. Sajet, appointed by former President Obama in 2013, was criticized for aligning with what Trump views as leftist and anti-American sentiments within the Smithsonian network of museums. This move follows an executive order targeting funding for programs at the Smithsonian that promote "divisive, race-centered ideology." Trump has also replaced leadership at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts with loyalists. This reflects the president's ongoing efforts to reshape federal cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the U.S. despite a court ruling that overturned many of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The UK hopes to finalize deals covering cars, metals, and airplane parts within weeks. While a federal court initially ruled the tariffs illegal, an appeals court paused the ruling, allowing the Trump administration to maintain them. The UK aims to implement the trade deal as quickly as possible, even as some companies face pressure to reduce prices. Trump unexpectedly announced he would be doubling foreign tariffs on steel and aluminium imports to 50%.</p>

          <p>China is upgrading its traditional mining industry by deploying driverless electric vehicles in Inner Mongolia's Yimin open-pit coal mine. The mine now uses a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks to transport coal and other materials. This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and aims to improve safety and efficiency. The move is part of China's broader push to digitally transform its coal industry and develop "intelligent coal mines."</p>

          <p>Ukraine's president has questioned Russia's commitment to progressing peace talks after Moscow confirmed it was sending a team to talks in Istanbul on Monday. Russia has yet to send its negotiating proposals to Ukraine - a key demand by Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of "doing everything it can to ensure the next possible meeting is fruitless". The first round of talks two weeks ago in Istanbul brought no breakthrough, but achieved a prisoner of war swap. As the talks approached, both Russia and Ukraine reported explosions on Friday night and in the early hours Saturday morning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while reducing reliance on China. Trump also said that $14bn would be invested in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though he later told reporters he had yet to see or approve the final deal. This announcement is the latest turn in Trump's approach to tariffs since re-entering office in January. (not investment advice)</p>
