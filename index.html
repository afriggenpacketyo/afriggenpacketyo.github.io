          <p>China's PLA Daily has voiced strong opposition to the United States' proposed "Golden Dome" space-based missile defense system, asserting it could destabilize global security and escalate the arms race in space. The commentary highlights the rapid expansion of the US Space Force and the acceleration of the $175 billion Golden Dome program, including the appointment of General Michael Guetlein as the direct program manager. The PLA Daily argues that these actions could intensify rivalry between major powers and challenge established international arms control norms, raising concerns about the militarization of outer space and its potential consequences. The publication also pointed to the critical programs under the US Space Development Agency and Missile Defence Agency as further evidence of this trend, sparking debate about the future of space security and international relations.</p>

Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove similar ads, as well as sharing information with other tech companies to address these apps across platforms, demonstrating a commitment to protecting its community from abuse.</p>

This is the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation dropping to 0.99%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures, including a recent 50 basis point cut to the benchmark repo rate. Economists anticipate further rate cuts due to softened commodity prices and increased availability of cheap Chinese goods. India's economy has shown stronger-than-expected growth, and trade negotiations with the U.S. are ongoing to secure a deal before potential tariff increases. (not investment advice)</p>

These parents are implementing changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time, aiming to reduce exposure to chemicals that may disrupt hormones. Experts acknowledge the validity of limiting exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals but caution against overly restrictive diets that could lead to eating disorders. Concerns are rising due to the average age of menarche in the US shifting earlier, which has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease and certain reproductive cancers, prompting a debate on the balance between parental intervention and potential unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>Despite global efforts to combat child labor, the world has failed to meet the 2025 target, with sub-Saharan Africa still having the highest number of underage workers. UNICEF and the ILO report a decrease in child laborers from 160 million in 2020 to 138 million in 2025, but challenges persist, especially in Africa, due to rapid population growth and poverty. The report highlights the need for addressing poverty at the household level, improving access to quality education, and enforcing laws against child labor practices. Climate change and other climate-related problems are worsening the problem, driving families into new and hazardous forms of labor.</p>

NPR's Domenico Montanaro suggests this reflects unpredictability in public opinion, indicating that many people are open to being swayed. The Trump administration plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, a move criticized by environmental advocates. The proposal is part of the Environmental Protection Agency's plan to roll back more than two dozen rules and policies.</p>

Watching football elicits boredom, despair, empathy, and anger, and researchers stress the importance of asking fans about these moments and setting their interpretations in a wider historical and cultural context.

A negotiated settlement that involves Gulf states could better integrate Iran into the region's economy and de-radicalize its foreign policy.
