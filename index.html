          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported slower-than-expected revenue growth for the first quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue misses, growing 17% to $29.27 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations. Despite the slowdown, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, with an operating margin of 39.5%, the widest since 2014. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the potential for increased customer support and revenue with greater capacity, especially concerning AI services. Jassy also noted AWS's diversification away from China for components over the past six years, indicating a strategic shift in supply chain management.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board critiques President Trump's first 100 days of his second term, asserting that he has attacked pillars of American democracy including separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people. The editorial emphasizes the importance of opposing Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging the legitimacy of his presidency and some of his policies. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to defend democracy and highlights the need to avoid exaggeration and prioritize effectiveness over emotion in opposing Trump's policies.

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce is urging the Trump administration to provide tariff exclusions for U.S. small businesses importing goods, warning that tariffs could cause irreparable harm and increase recession risks. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, requested an "automatic exclusion" from new tariffs for small businesses, citing their limited capital reserves. Economists have warned that the Trump administration's tariff policies are already weighing on growth and have raised the chances of a recession over the next 12 months, with potential impacts including higher prices for consumers and financial difficulties for small businesses.</p>

This move comes as Kennedy has faced criticism for remarks misleading people into thinking measles infections are easily curable and inflating myths about measles vaccines. The HHS spokesperson said the CDC effort would involve working with universities to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards. Experts have criticized Kennedy's approach, emphasizing that vaccination is the only way to prevent the highly infectious disease.</p>

The military's Northern Command said it was establishing a narrow strip of land along the southern border of Texas that will become part of Fort Bliss. Migrants entering the newly designated military installations will be considered to be trespassing and can be temporarily detained by U.S. troops until Border Patrol agents arrive.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his post as national security adviser and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio temporarily replacing him. Waltz faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources suggest Trump decided to nominate Waltz due to the Signal situation and a perception that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff, though Trump respects Waltz and gave him a high-profile new post.</p>
