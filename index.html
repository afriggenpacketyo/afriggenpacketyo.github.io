            <p>The National Weather Service (NWS) is facing massive staff cuts, leading to fears about forecast quality and public safety. Staffing limitations may reduce or suspend weather balloon launches, impacting forecasting data. The Sacramento office has already stopped answering public phone lines and reduced forecasting products. The Trump administration is looking to further slash NOAA's budget, which would effectively end all climate-focused research. These cuts have the potential to degrade weather forecasts and compromise key alerts during weather emergencies.</p>

A federal judge in Virginia ruled on Thursday that the search giant illegally maintained a monopoly in the online advertising market, leveraging its position to make more money and squash competition.

The case against Big Tech is that these big companies have too much power and are not being properly regulated.</p>

He also mentioned his obligation to protect the Second Amendment, stating he ran on that promise and will continue to do so.

Experts note that stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is unusual, especially for a large institution like Harvard. The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, but that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements.</p>

However, the balance shifted by the end of the first quarter, with Brazil reporting a US$700 million trade surplus with China. The unexpected deficit was largely attributed to concerns among Brazilian business executives about the growing trade war between Beijing and Washington. (not investment advice)</p>
