          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed on Truth Social that he was the victim of a "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations. He cited a series of technical failures, including a malfunctioning escalator, a faulty teleprompter, and a non-working microphone during his speech to the General Assembly. Trump demanded an immediate investigation into the incidents, which he asserted were not coincidental. A UN official suggested that a person in Trump's entourage may have inadvertently stopped the escalator.</p>

          <p>The French navy successfully seized nearly 10 tons of cocaine, with an estimated market value of over $600 million, from a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa. The operation was conducted by two navy ships following a tip from anti-drug authorities and British police. This seizure is part of France's long-standing Corymbe naval mission, which aims to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea. The action highlights ongoing international efforts to combat large-scale drug trafficking in the region.</p>

As CarMax's performance is often seen as an indicator for the sector, the disappointing results also negatively impacted the stock prices of other car retailers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's promotion of leucovorin, a prescription form of vitamin B9, as a treatment for autism is being met with skepticism from many scientists and parents. The FDA is relabeling the drug for cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), a rare condition that affects a minority of individuals with autism, but its efficacy for autism itself is unproven. Critics argue the administration is jumping the gun, promoting a simplistic solution for a complex disorder based on preliminary and inconclusive scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's effort to rebrand its major tax legislation, previously called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," as the "Working Families Tax Cut Bill" is deceptive. The author contends the bill overwhelmingly favors the wealthiest 1% of households, who receive a larger share of the cuts than the bottom 60% combined. Furthermore, the article asserts that cuts to benefits like Medicaid and food assistance will leave millions of low- and middle-income families worse off financially, despite modest tax reductions.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has published a paper in the journal Nature claiming a significant breakthrough in battery technology with a new hydride ion battery. This rechargeable, room-temperature battery reportedly has a specific capacity up to six times higher than some conventional lithium-ion batteries. The innovation relies on a rare earth-based electrolyte that uses negatively charged hydrogen ions (hydride ions) as the energy carrier. The team successfully demonstrated a prototype, suggesting a promising future for clean energy storage applications.</p>

The research, conducted by economists at Arizona State University, highlights that the Latino GDP grew by 50% from 2015 to 2023, a rate far exceeding that of the non-Latino population. This growth is attributed to rising education levels, entrepreneurship, and consumer spending, positioning the demographic as a critical driver of the American economy.</p>
