          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) announced it has killed the Russian agents responsible for assassinating a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The suspects, a man and a woman, were reportedly eliminated after resisting arrest during a special operation. The assassinated colonel, Ivan Voronych, was targeted in a daylight attack, and media reports suggest he was involved in covert operations against Russian forces. This event occurs amidst ongoing intense conflict, including a recent large-scale Russian drone attack on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A Senate Homeland Security Committee report has detailed a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The report highlights significant communication gaps, noting that information about the shooter on a nearby roof was not relayed to Trump's detail in time. It also points to organizational errors, such as an obstructed view for a countersniper team, and accuses the agency of denying resource requests for the campaign. The Secret Service has stated it is implementing reforms in response to the findings.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire in the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and between 50 to 80 other structures. The fire also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighter evacuations and complicated containment efforts. This incident is part of a larger, intense wildfire season, with another major fire burning in Arizona's Kaibab National Forest. Meanwhile, smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires is causing unhealthy air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>The Lord's Test match between England and India is poised for a thrilling conclusion on its final day, fueled by growing tension between the two teams. After a pulsating fourth day, England needs six more wickets to win, while India requires 135 runs to secure a 2-1 series lead. A chaotic final hour on Sunday saw England's bowlers, led by Brydon Carse and Ben Stokes, take crucial late wickets, igniting the crowd and setting up a high-stakes finale. The outcome will likely depend on which side better handles the immense pressure on Monday morning.</p>

          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa has placed Police Minister Senzo Mchunu on a leave of absence and initiated a commission of inquiry into his alleged ties to criminal gangs. The move follows public accusations by a provincial police commissioner that Mchunu obstructed investigations into political murders and had been compromised. While Ramaphosa's action addresses calls from across the political spectrum, some opposition parties have criticized the move as insufficient, arguing it allows the minister to retain his salary and potentially undermine the process. The commission is expected to deliver its first report within three months.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, the former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at age 82 in a London hospital after a prolonged illness. A polarizing figure, Buhari first led Nigeria in 1983 after a military coup, implementing a repressive anti-corruption campaign before being ousted himself. He later returned to power as a "converted democrat," winning the 2015 election on a platform of fighting corruption and insecurity. However, his two terms were marked by economic decline, widespread violence, and his own persistent, undisclosed health issues, leaving behind a complex and fraught legacy.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a new sanctions bill described as a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation would give President Trump the authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its goods. The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to de-escalate the war in Ukraine. The senators believe this strong economic leverage is necessary to force Putin to the negotiating table and end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery by founder Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create the "Cookie Factory" gallery, which opened in May. The mission of the privately funded space is to provide a place for community connection and healing through art, a cause personal to Precourt. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and is part of a long-term vision to foster discussion on important subjects through art.</p>

          <p>A Senate report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least 10 requests to enhance security for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The requests included additional counter snipers, a stronger counter-drone system, and more counter-assault personnel. The report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress that no asset requests were denied for the Butler rally. The findings point to a disturbing pattern of negligence and communication failures that culminated in a preventable tragedy.</p>

The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, stated that the federal government must invest in better science and technology to provide more advance warning for extreme weather events like floods, tornadoes, and fires. She plans to send President Trump a letter with bipartisan recommendations to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including better radar and ocean monitoring. Cantwell warned against proposed budget cuts to NOAA, arguing the investment in science is minuscule compared to the cost of disaster recovery.</p>

In a subsequent interview, Homan walked back earlier comments that seemed to confirm racial profiling by ICE agents, clarifying that physical appearance cannot be the sole factor for detaining someone. He also admitted that U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids in what he termed "collateral arrests."</p>
