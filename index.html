        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study has found that bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, may not be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea. The study, which involved 270 participants traveling to regions in Asia and Africa, found no significant difference in diarrhea symptoms between those who took Pepto Bismol and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate has been approved for treating diarrhea since 1939, its off-label use for prevention may not be as beneficial as previously thought. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine if certain traveler groups or circumstances might benefit from the medication, even though the current study did not reach its target sample size.</p>

KKR's withdrawal was influenced by the politicization of the water industry, deterring investors. Despite the setback, Thames Water is exploring alternative plans with creditors and stakeholders, while Castle Water has expressed interest in providing financial support, though Thames Water is currently only engaging with its creditors' plan.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is suing Alina Habba, a top Trump lawyer, alleging malicious prosecution.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its economic growth forecast for the United States, attributing the downturn to tariffs imposed by President Trump. The OECD now projects a 1.6% growth for the U.S. in 2025, down from the 2.2% forecast in March, with a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026. The organization also warns of a potential surge in U.S. consumer prices, potentially reaching 4% by the end of 2025, due to higher trade costs. This forecast echoes concerns raised by analysts and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the risk of stagflation caused by tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure air pollution severity and associated health risks, utilizing six color-coded categories ranging from good (green) to hazardous (maroon). The EPA calculates the AQI based on five major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Higher AQI values indicate greater health risks, with "very unhealthy" air posing risks to the general public and "hazardous" levels indicating an air quality emergency. Resources like AirNow.gov provide real-time AQI updates, pollutant information, and activity recommendations based on local air quality conditions.</p>

          <p>Ramon Morales-Reyes, who was publicly accused by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of writing threatening letters to President Trump, was framed by another inmate. The inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, wanted Morales-Reyes to be deported so he would no longer be able to testify against him in an upcoming trial for robbery. Scott admitted to writing the letters and including Trump's name to ensure Secret Service involvement, hoping it would lead to the dismissal of his case. Morales-Reyes has been cleared after a handwriting test did not match the letters.</p>

          <p>The government is facing criticism for suggesting that favorable weather conditions are a primary factor driving record numbers of small boat crossings in the English Channel. The Home Office released figures showing a peak in "red days," defined as days likely to see crossings due to weather, in the past year. Critics accuse the government of deflecting blame for the situation, while the government insists it is working to fix a broken asylum system. The figures also reveal a rise in severely overcrowded boats, indicating a willingness among smugglers to take greater risks.</p>

Attacks and pressure on journalists are increasing, with a lack of accountability for perpetrators, while surveillance of journalists is also a growing concern. The EU has withheld millions in aid due to sluggish reform, prompting the government to launch new procedures and draft media laws, though concerns remain about their implementation and potential for abuse. Many in the media sector expect the situation to deteriorate further, with the government tightening control and turning the media into a propaganda machine.</p>
