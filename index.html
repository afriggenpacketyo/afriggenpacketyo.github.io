          <p>The Metropolitan Police are actively investigating media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he provided an officer with her social security number and date of birth to "dig up dirt" on her before a 2011 newspaper article was published. This development comes shortly after the Prince relinquished his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny over his connections to Jeffrey Epstein and the sexual assault allegations made by Giuffre, which he has consistently denied.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a daring daytime robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, utilizing a basket lift to access a window and steal jewelry of immense historical value. The heist, which took place shortly after the museum opened to tourists, forced an immediate closure and evacuation as authorities launched an investigation. The stolen items, including pieces from Napoleon's collection, were taken from the Galerie d'Apollon, which houses part of the French Crown Jewels, prompting a major police response to recover the artifacts.</p>

Hamas has denied involvement in any clashes in the area, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating it has lost contact with its remaining groups in the Israeli-controlled zone.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on credible reports that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip. Such an act would represent a grave violation of the current U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. Hamas rejected the claims as "false allegations," accusing Israel of supporting armed gangs in Israeli-controlled areas. The warning follows the emergence of a video showing Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, highlighting internal power struggles within Gaza.</p>

          <p>A commentary by Charles M. Blow addresses the severe crisis in local journalism, noting that over 3,200 print newspapers have disappeared since 2005, with newsroom employment dropping by 60%. The article argues that the decline of local news outlets erodes community cohesion, as these publications provide essential "connective tissue" through both accountability reporting and coverage of local life. The loss of this common ground is linked to increased political polarization, as nationalized news sources often frame issues through a partisan lens, undermining shared community identity.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended his characterization of the nationwide "No Kings" anti-Trump protests as "hate America" rallies. When questioned about the rhetoric, Johnson clarified that his criticism was aimed at the protesters' message, not the individuals, citing what he described as violent rhetoric and hateful messages captured on video. He further asserted that there is a rise of Marxism within the Democratic Party, pointing to the mayoral candidacy of Zohran Mamdani in New York City as evidence of this trend, though he specified he was not referring to the entire party.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While he did not confirm any decision ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax cut comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, with Miliband reiterating a pledge to reduce average bills by £300 by 2030 through a transition to home-grown clean energy.</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Differentiate John Bolton Indictment from Other Cases Against Trump Critics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts argue that the criminal indictment of former national security adviser John Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information is fundamentally different from the politically charged cases against other Trump critics like James Comey and Letitia James. While the timing has raised questions of political motivation, specialists note that the charges against Bolton appear to be based on more serious and sustained misconduct. The case highlights the legal complexities of prosecuting high-ranking officials for mishandling sensitive documents, a rare but not unprecedented action for the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Golfer Tommy Fleetwood won his eighth European tour title at the DP World India Championship with a final round of 65, finishing two shots ahead of the competition.

Starting the final round two shots behind the leader, Fleetwood carded four consecutive birdies around the turn to seize control and continue his strong run of form this season.</p>

          <p>Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice-minister of finance, expressed confidence that the country's economy will achieve its growth target of around 5% this year. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China could sustain an annual growth rate of 4.5% to 5% over the next five years. This sustained growth, he argued, would establish a solid foundation for the nation to achieve its 2035 goal of "socialist modernization." His optimistic forecast comes as Chinese leaders prepare for a key party meeting to finalize the next five-year plan.</p>

          <p>American consumers are feeling the financial strain of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, reporting significantly higher prices on everyday goods from groceries to car tires. A study by S&P Global estimates that two-thirds of the resulting $1.2 trillion in increased business expenses will be passed on to consumers, costing households nearly $2,400 more per year. Many families say they have had to shrink their budgets, cut non-essential spending, and contend with empty store shelves, contradicting administration promises that the trade policy would make living more affordable for everyone.</p>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing a historic surge in electricity demand, primarily driven by the construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. Georgia Power has requested a nearly $16 billion plan to add 10 gigawatts of energy, with about 80% designated for these new facilities. This unprecedented proposal has sparked concerns among consumer advocates and environmental groups about significant utility rate hikes for residential customers and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. Public hearings are scheduled to address the plan, which highlights a growing national tension between technological expansion and its impact on consumers and the environment.</p>

Experts suggest that while the ongoing government shutdown should not halt the process, it may cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare hotline. It is crucial for individuals to review their Medicare Advantage or Part D prescription drug plans to ensure their doctors and medications will still be covered at an affordable cost in the coming year, and to wait until the government reopens before finalizing decisions.</p>
