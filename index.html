          <p>Heavy monsoon rains triggered catastrophic flash flooding in the Ruidoso area of southern New Mexico, resulting in at least three confirmed fatalities. The rapidly rising waters of the Rio Ruidoso, which crested at a record high, swept an entire house downstream and prompted at least 85 swift-water rescues of people trapped in homes and vehicles. This disaster occurred in the same region devastated by wildfires last year, where burn scars have increased the landscape's vulnerability to such events. Emergency crews are continuing search and rescue operations for several unaccounted-for individuals.</p>

          <p>Dozens of new allegations of misconduct have emerged against British TV presenter Gregg Wallace, which he continues to deny. Following an initial investigation that led to his departure from the show 'MasterChef,' an additional 50 people have come forward with claims, including inappropriate sexual comments and touching. Baroness Helena Kennedy, a watchdog for standards in creative industries, has publicly advised Wallace against dismissing the women's claims as fabrications. The controversy has also brought criticism upon television industry managers for allegedly failing to address concerns about his behavior earlier.</p>

          <p>G8 Education, one of Australia's largest private childcare providers, has announced it will accelerate the installation of CCTV cameras across its 400-plus centers. The decision follows deeply disturbing allegations against a former employee, who faces over 70 charges, including the sexual assault of eight children. In addition to the new surveillance, the company will allow parents to choose who performs personal care tasks for their children and has commissioned an independent review. While the move is a response to the crisis, some child safety experts have expressed concerns that CCTV is not a complete solution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to all its embassies and consulates regarding attempts to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials using artificial intelligence. The alert came after an imposter posing as Rubio contacted at least three foreign ministers, a U.S. senator, and a governor via text, Signal, and voicemail. While officials described the attempts as unsophisticated and unsuccessful, the incident highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology for deception and espionage. This follows a similar incident involving President Trump's chief of staff and an FBI warning about malicious actors using AI to impersonate senior officials.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Trump's Immigration Crackdown Risks Alienating Latino Voters</h2>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion article argues that while Donald Trump was making historic gains with Latino voters, his administration's current aggressive immigration enforcement tactics risk derailing that progress. The author notes that recent ICE raids in Los Angeles are targeting long-term residents rather than just recent arrivals, employing tactics that instill widespread fear. This approach is contrasted with the political missteps of California Republicans in the 1990s, whose anti-immigrant policies radicalized a generation of Latino voters against them. The piece suggests that the current cruelty is causing a similar backlash, even among conservative Latinos who were previously open to Trump.</p>

          <p>As the United Kingdom's railways transition back to public ownership, a new crisis is emerging over the role of 'open access' private operators. While the Labour government is renationalizing train services franchise by franchise, these private competitors, who operate on high-traffic lines like the East Coast Main Line, are credited with improving service and lowering fares. However, the Department for Transport has expressed concerns that these operators divert revenue from state-run services, creating a cost for taxpayers. This has sparked fears that the government may be seeking to limit or eliminate this competition, a move opposed by many in business and politics.</p>

The head of LACA, a school food organization, stated that government funding for free school meals is not keeping pace with inflation, forcing schools to bridge a significant financial gap. A recent government increase of just 3p per meal has been called inadequate, with caterers reporting the true cost is much higher.

The show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, explores the cultural and social confusion of navigating a new country where, despite a shared language, customs are vastly different. Produced by the company behind classics like 'Notting Hill,' the series aims to contrast the romanticized fantasy of England with its modern reality.

Engineers used a method of creating straw checkerboards to lock down shifting sands, which is then followed by planting drought-resistant trees.

          <p>The recent catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River in Central Texas is part of a long and deadly history of similar events in the region, known as 'Flash Flood Alley.' According to historical records, the river has experienced major, life-threatening flooding more than a dozen times in the last century, with some past events cresting even higher than the recent disaster. Hydrologists note that the area's terrain, with steep slopes and narrow riverbeds, makes it extremely reactive to heavy rainfall, leaving little time for warnings. Experts say that despite improvements in forecasting, the combination of overnight rainfall and a densely populated area made this event particularly devastating.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Losing Streak Extends to Five Games After Being Dominated by Brewers Rookie Pitcher</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their fifth consecutive loss, falling 3-1 to the Milwaukee Brewers, largely due to a masterful performance by rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski. The 23-year-old right-hander struck out 12 Dodgers batters over six innings, allowing only one run which came from a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani. Despite a solid outing from their own pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers' offense was completely stifled by Misiorowski's high-velocity fastball and effective command. The loss highlighted the team's current struggles, which are compounded by injuries to several key veteran players.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has targeted Japan and South Korea with new tariff threats, increasing the potential for a sharper economic downturn in the two export-dependent nations. Both countries, key U.S. allies, are already grappling with slowing growth and saw their economies contract in the first quarter of the year. The proposed 25% tariffs would heavily impact their automotive and steel industries, which are major contributors to their GDP. While the administration has suggested the tariffs could be adjusted if the nations open their markets, the move is seen as a pressure tactic that adds to global trade policy uncertainty.

          <p>Just weeks after his 80th birthday, legendary musician John Fogerty performed an energetic and powerful rock-and-roll show at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his 'Celebration Tour.' The concert heavily featured the iconic songs of Creedence Clearwater Revival, the band he famously fronted, whose songwriting rights he fully regained two years ago after a long legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's vocal performance was remarkably consistent and his guitar playing was outstanding, as he played for two hours without a break. The show was a memorable exhibition of his enduring talent and the timeless appeal of his classic rock anthems.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. The move comes after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on any country that is part of the BRICS economic bloc, which he claimed was set up to hurt the U.S. dollar. Trump's increasingly aggressive posture towards the group, which unites major emerging economies from the Global South, has been met with defiance. The BRICS bloc, which has recently expanded, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions and create an alternative economic framework.</p>

The author suggests that this shift presents a unique opportunity for Hong Kong, as China's most cosmopolitan city, to become a prominent hub for providing global public goods.

This sprawling operation allows North Korea to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, which is then funneled to fund Kim Jong Un's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
