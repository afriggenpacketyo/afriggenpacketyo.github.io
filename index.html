          <p>Two individuals sustained injuries in a shooting that occurred on the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities campus, near the 3M Arena at Mariucci, following a Wayzata High School graduation ceremony. Interim Police Chief Erik Swanson stated that the incident took place around 8:20 p.m., and a suspect is currently in custody, though their identity has not been released. Both victims are reported to be in stable condition, and campus police, along with the Minneapolis Police Department and Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz expressed his condolences and affirmed the state's readiness to assist the school in any way possible, emphasizing the disruption of what should have been a joyful occasion. Optimism is relatively low given the unexpected violence.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on Harvard University, including threats to redirect research funding and investigations into alleged antisemitism and bias. These actions have sent shockwaves across American higher education, raising concerns about academic independence and political interference. While some conservatives argue that universities have become too liberal and need to be shaken up, others fear that Trump's measures could undermine the diverse intellectual environment of these institutions. The university has used the courts to fight back, arguing that the government is attempting to micromanage academic institutions, and opinion polls suggest that a majority of the general population supports American universities and doesn't approve of the proposed funding cuts. This is a highly divisive issue, with no clear resolution in sight.</p>

          <p>Patricia Krenwinkel, a 77-year-old former member of the infamous Manson family, has been recommended for parole after being convicted of seven counts of murder in 1971. A California panel determined that Krenwinkel, who was involved in the horrific Tate-LaBianca murders, poses a minimal risk of reoffending. This recommendation marks a significant step in Krenwinkel's decades-long efforts to gain parole, though the final decision rests with the governor of California. The case continues to evoke strong emotions and serves as a reminder of the brutal crimes committed by the Manson family.</p>

          <p>San Diego City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera is facing backlash after labeling ICE agents as "terrorists" in an Instagram post featuring a photo of agents in a San Diego neighborhood. Elo-Rivera criticized ICE's actions, claiming they target parents, courthouse attendees, and workers under the guise of safety, further describing ICE agents as "jackbooted thugs," "cowards," and "criminals." The post sparked a response from Stephen Miller, a former White House advisor, who accused the left of encouraging violence against law enforcement. The incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding immigration enforcement and sanctuary city policies, as well as a larger debate about freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) secured its first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0, a win celebrated by Qatari club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi as validation of Qatar Sports Investments' long-term project. The victory, however, has renewed scrutiny of Qatar's influence in European football, with concerns raised about state ownership and human rights issues. While PSG fans seem to embrace the Qatari ownership, critics point to the club's heavy reliance on external funding and the displacement of homegrown talent.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key sectors like healthcare, defense, and education. With the government committed to fiscal responsibility, potential cuts to unprotected areas outside of healthcare, defense, and schools are likely. The IFS suggests that the level of NHS funding will significantly impact other departments, and increased defense spending could exacerbate the situation. The upcoming Spending Review on June 11 is expected to outline departmental budgets for the next three to four years, with Whitehall insiders anticipating an "ugly" outcome as ministers compete for limited resources. This is a reflection of the difficult economic climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sale of single-use disposable vapes is now banned across the UK, aiming to curb youth vaping and reduce environmental waste. While retailers can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, the ban targets disposable vapes, which are considered a key factor in the rise of youth vaping. Violators face fines, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping effectively. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, its long-term health risks remain unknown, and disposable vapes have contributed to a concerning trend of non-smoking young people taking up vaping. The ban is intended to prevent future harm to a younger generation.</p>

          <p>Following Inter Milan's defeat to PSG in the Champions League final, questions arise about the team's future and potential rebuild. The team's aging squad, with an average age of 30 years, was outmatched by PSG's younger and more energetic players. Inter president Giuseppe Marotta has indicated a shift towards investing in younger players, and coach Inzaghi acknowledged the need for more signings. The loss has fueled speculation about Inzaghi's future with the club, as he declined to commit to staying for the Club World Cup, but this is an opportunity to renew the team's focus.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Toxic Nation," produced by MAHA Films, focuses on the potential health risks associated with ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, herbicides, and fluoride. The film aligns with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., advocating for policy changes to reduce chronic disease. The documentary's release follows a MAHA Commission report calling for an overhaul of federal policies related to food systems and environmental toxins. While some experts support the documentary's concerns, others argue that the science is still evolving and that the benefits of certain foods and practices outweigh the potential risks, but there is a growing debate to be had.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could be exploited by eavesdroppers to compromise the security of the quantum communication system. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, however the flaws in the experimental implementation of the quantum keys could be an issue.

          <p>The UK government plans to spend Â£1.5 billion on at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its weapons production capabilities. This investment aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity and generate approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review and reflects lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where depleted stockpiles were an issue. The government will also purchase over 7,000 British-built long-range weapons, increasing overall munitions spending to Â£6 billion, however the act of producing more weapons is inherently an act of aggression.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck hauling pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to save as many bees as possible. By the next morning, most of the bees had returned to their hives, and those responsible for their delivery were in charge, resulting in a relatively happy ending.</p>
