        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee advised caution regarding further interest rate cuts, despite a recent reduction, citing persistent inflation and a weakening labor market. He emphasized the need for a gradual pace to avoid being overly aggressive, especially with inflation remaining above the 2% target for over four years. Goolsbee noted that while the neutral rate suggests further cuts are possible, future actions depend on economic progress and labor market stability. The Fed's new labor market monitor currently indicates stability, but officials remain watchful of economic indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

Notable past tournaments include two U.S. Opens won by Tiger Woods and Lucas Glover, and two Barclays championships. The course is also slated for the 2028 Women's PGA Championship and the 2033 PGA Championship, cementing its legacy in professional golf.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its global economic growth forecast for 2025 upwards to 3.2%, citing unexpected resilience in many economies, particularly emerging markets. The U.S. growth projection also increased to 1.8% for 2025, driven by strong AI-related investment and pre-tariff front-loading. However, the OECD warned of significant risks, including escalating tariffs and policy uncertainty, which could dampen investment and trade in the latter half of the year. Inflation expectations for G20 countries and the U.S. were slightly lowered, though tariffs are anticipated to exert new inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold remains a highly attractive commodity, serving as both a form of currency and a safe-haven investment, particularly during periods of market or economic uncertainty. As of September 22, 2025, the price stands at $3,728.61 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuations. Numerous factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty, significantly influence its spot price. Gold's historical ability to retain value makes it a smart bet for many investors seeking an inflation hedge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris admitted on "Good Morning America" that she felt it was "reckless" not to personally challenge former President Joe Biden's decision to seek reelection. In her campaign memoir, she stated the decision was Biden's to make, but upon reflection, she wished she had voiced her concerns. Harris explained her hesitation stemmed from fears of appearing "self-serving," despite maintaining unwavering admiration for Biden's capacity to serve as president. This revelation offers insight into internal political dynamics during a critical period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners possess significant untapped equity, making Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) a potentially more affordable financing option for debt consolidation or major expenses. With average HELOC rates at 8.05%, they are considerably lower than credit card rates exceeding 21% and personal loan rates around 12%. Experts suggest that consolidating high-interest debt with a HELOC can lead to substantial annual interest savings, especially with potential Fed rate cuts on the horizon. HELOCs offer flexibility and possible tax advantages if used for home improvements, but responsible use and careful planning are crucial to manage future repayment increases.

          <h2>Germany Navigates Diplomatic Challenges Regarding Recognition of a Palestinian State</h2>

          <p>Germany is maintaining a cautious stance on recognizing a Palestinian state, differing from several European allies, citing that conditions for statehood are not yet fulfilled and recognition should be the final step in a peace process. This position creates a dilemma for Germany, which feels a special responsibility for Israel's security while also criticizing its military actions in Gaza. Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasizes the fight against antisemitism but faces mounting pressure from within the EU and civil society to take a stronger stance, despite public opinion in Germany favoring recognition. The US also rejects recognition, further complicating the international landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a "major speech" at the United Nations General Assembly, focusing on "renewal of American strength" and critiquing globalist institutions for their perceived decay of world order. His remarks are expected to touch upon the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with Trump opposing the recognition of Palestinian statehood, viewing it as a "reward to Hamas."

          <p>NATO has strongly warned Russia over an escalating campaign of airspace violations across its eastern and northern member states, with Secretary General Mark Rutte stating the alliance will use "all necessary military and non-military tools" to deter threats. This warning follows recent incidents, including a Russian jet over Estonia and drones shot down over Poland and spotted over Romania. While specific culprits for recent drone sightings over Copenhagen and Oslo airports have not been identified, Danish and Norwegian leaders have suggested Russian involvement, though Moscow denies the allegations. The incidents highlight heightened tensions and increased vigilance within NATO.</p>

The complaint highlights distressing cases where insurers initially refused legitimate claims, causing more distress than the original incidents. Which? also accuses the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of failing to adequately protect consumers. While the Association of British Insurers states members work hard to process claims, the action demands a response within 90 days, signaling a significant push for industry reform and better consumer outcomes.</p>

While Disney reinstated the show after "thoughtful conversations," some major ABC affiliates, like Sinclair and Nexstar, stated they would continue to replace Kimmel's show with news programming.

          <p>AI tools are increasingly targeting parents with promises to simplify tasks, from party planning to crafting lunchbox notes, and even soothing children. While alluring for stressed parents, this article argues that outsourcing child-rearing to AI risks sapping intimacy and human connection. It suggests that AI cannot replicate the "tacit knowledge" and personalized care that human parents provide, nor can it build the community support networks essential for parental well-being. The article encourages parents to trust their instincts and reevaluate priorities rather than relying on AI to manage ever-growing to-do lists, emphasizing the value of human interaction.</p>

          <p>International support for Palestinian statehood has surged, with several European nations recognizing Palestine and a UN General Assembly resolution outlining steps toward a two-state solution. This global mobilization comes as the war in Gaza escalates and Israel's government, led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, vehemently opposes statehood, even considering West Bank annexation. While supporters see recognition as a path to peace, critics question if it's merely "political theater" given the intractable reality on the ground. The U.S. remains opposed to unilateral recognition, highlighting a growing divide between its stance and that of many allies.</p>

          <p>Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, is embroiled in a deep scandal following the revelation of an email to convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, where she called him her "supreme friend" and apologized for publicly denouncing him.

Despite past controversies, Fergie had shown a knack for bouncing back, even attending royal Christmas gatherings in recent years.

This incident follows recent Russian drone incursions in Poland and Romania, and fighter jet violations of Estonian airspace, suggesting a "wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour," according to NATO. While Danish police haven't identified a culprit, they noted the drones were operated by a "capable actor" with the "will and tools to show off."
