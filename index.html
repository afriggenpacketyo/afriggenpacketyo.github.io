          <p>Two women were seriously injured in Leeds, England, in an attack involving a crossbow and a firearm, leading to the arrest of a 38-year-old man. Counter-terrorism police have taken over the investigation, though authorities believe the suspect acted alone. The incident occurred on Otley Road, a popular pub crawl route, causing businesses to close early and raising concerns among residents. Police have urged the public to avoid speculation and share information that could affect the active investigation.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy, a move seen by some as a signal of his preferred successor. The appointment comes amid succession fears and frustration among Palestinians due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Israeli military operations in the West Bank. Critics view the focus on internal politics as a sign of complacency within the Palestinian leadership. Al-Sheikh's promotion has been interpreted differently by analysts, with some believing it solidifies his position as heir apparent, while others see it as a move to appease Arab officials.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term as US president has been marked by volatile trade policies, creating uncertainty in the global economy.

          <p>A California legislator is urging the State Bar of California to return to the traditional national bar exam format after a problematic February exam administration. The State Bar's new multiple-choice questions faced technical issues and irregularities, leading to calls for a return to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) system. Concerns were raised about the use of artificial intelligence in developing exam questions without proper oversight. Critics argue that the State Bar should prioritize a fair and reliable test, even if it means abandoning remote testing options.</p>

          <p>The "Gran Abuelo," an approximately 5,400-year-old tree in Chile, is facing a threat from a proposed highway project that would cut through a protected national park. Scientists warn that the road will increase the risk of wildfires and damage the ecosystem. The tree, also known as a Patagonian cypress, is climate-sensitive, with each ring inside its trunk a yearly weather record that helps researchers reconstruct climate patterns. The government has temporarily backed off due to pressure from scientists and local residents.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre has been hailed as an unflinching campaigner for survivors of sexual abuse, who took on the wealthy and the powerful during the course of her life. She was a public figure who sought justice for crimes committed against her by Jeffrey Epstein. Her family confirmed she took her own life at her farm in Western Australia after being a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Her relentless pursuit of justice made her a public figure, with the allegations she made against Prince Andrew setting in train a legal battle that culminated in an out-of-court settlement in which the royal admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
