        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese stocks, led by the Nikkei 225 and Topix, surged after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation amid pressure from a national election defeat. Investors are now closely watching potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi, known for her stance on deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes, viewed as a candidate likely to drive economic growth and justify the market's positive response. This significant political transition, alongside a weakening yen and rising bond yields reflecting inflation concerns, sets the stage for extended uncertainty in Japan's financial landscape. The broader Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading, with China's exports missing estimates, while global oil prices saw slight increases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's August exports increased by 4.4% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, falling short of economists' 5.0% growth estimates and marking the lowest level since February. This slowdown is attributed to businesses front-loading activities to preempt higher U.S. tariffs and a high comparative base from the previous year, which saw rapid export growth. Imports also grew less than expected at 1.3%, indicating muted domestic demand influenced by the persistent real estate slump and rising job insecurity. The ongoing U.S.-China tariff truce, extended for another 90 days with significant duties remaining, continues to shape trade dynamics and presents challenges for China's economic recovery.

          <p>An Australian judge has sentenced Erin Patterson to life in prison, with a non-parole period of 33 years, for the triple murder of her estranged husband's relatives using death cap mushrooms. Three victims died after a beef Wellington lunch in 2023, while the sole survivor, pastor Ian Wilkinson, spent months in hospital and urged Patterson to confess, despite her maintaining innocence. The motive behind the killings remains a mystery, attracting significant public and media interest, even as Patterson insists on her innocence. This high-profile case has left the affected families devastated and underscores the tragic consequences of such a calculated crime.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was seen pushing a Buffalo Bills fan after the fan made contact with his helmet following a touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. The incident occurred late in the third quarter, with the Ravens leading 34-19, and no penalty was assessed on the play. Jackson appeared to regain his composure on the bench, while Hopkins did not react to the fan's actions. This event sparked discussion among commentators about the fine line between fan interaction and player safety, highlighting the challenges athletes face with close proximity to the stands during intense game moments.</p>

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot secured approximately $100 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to $280 million in under two years. The company also launched Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, anticipating "robotic butlers" within five years. Venture capitalists are heavily investing in humanoid robots, driven by expectations of AI integration transforming human-machine interaction, despite current AI for robots lagging behind generative AI advancements. The startup, already generating revenue from sales to schools, hotels, and retirement homes, plans an initial public offering next year, aiming to reduce robot prices to consumer market levels within three to five years.

          <p>A joint China-US study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly discovered a solid inner core within Mars. This core, approximately 600km in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars's total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The finding challenges previous assumptions, as most celestial bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core. This significant discovery could reignite discussions about whether Earth was the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics, potentially adding Mars to the list of planets with inner cores alongside Earth and the Moon.</p>

One child, a girl, was located at the scene with the deceased man, prompting a massive and urgent search operation for the remaining two children, a boy and a girl, amid dropping overnight temperatures. Phillips had been evading authorities since December 2021, using his survival skills to live off-grid with his children, and the children's mother expressed deep relief for their ordeal's end.</p>

          <p>The family of Raish Ahmed, a 50-year-old man murdered by his neighbor in Canning Town, East London, has spoken out, alleging he was "failed by London" due to insufficient action from authorities. Daniel Whybrow, 46, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 24 years for the stabbing, which occurred after a dispute over a communal door. Ahmed's family and neighbors had repeatedly complained about Whybrow's aggressive and antisocial behavior for months, with police and the council allegedly not taking the threats seriously. The tragic incident has left the family traumatized and unable to return home.</p>

          <p>Chicago churches are urging congregants to remain calm and prepare for an anticipated federal intervention, which could involve immigration enforcement crackdowns and National Guard deployment. Leaders like Rev. Marshall Hatch advised carrying identification and staying connected, emphasizing resistance to "fascism and authoritarianism." This local response comes as President Trump has repeatedly threatened federal action in Democratic-led cities, despite local leaders' objections and declining crime rates. The prospect of increased law enforcement has inflamed tensions in Black and Latino communities, where trust in authorities is fragile, highlighting community efforts to support residents and advocate for resources over military presence.</p>

The dramatic birth, witnessed by her family, occurred during a match dedicated to a deceased "uncle Huggy," leading the couple to name their son Henry James in his memory.

This arrangement, though not without challenges like loneliness, works for them by fostering individual independence and maintaining communication.

The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds and featuring horses carved by Charles Looff, had been closed since 2022 following its previous operator's death and a need for repairs. The acquisition is part of a broader restoration plan for the park, with hopes for the carousel to reopen before its 2026 centennial and the 2028 Olympic Games.

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia, according to Bank of America. This shift is driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, expectations of looser Federal Reserve monetary policy in 2025-2026, and Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market, projected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030. While U.S. equities attracted significant inflows previously, investment has slowed this year, with a more even split between U.S. and international markets.

This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. Astrophysicists explain that the moon appears red because blue wavelengths of sunlight are dispersed more easily by Earth's atmosphere, allowing only the red wavelengths to reflect onto the lunar surface. The event provided a spectacular visual for observers in regions best placed to view it, offering a moment of shared wonder at natural cosmic occurrences.</p>
