          <p>This article from DW explains the formation and purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which was established in 1949 to deter Soviet expansion after World War II and promote political integration in Europe. The core of NATO is its collective security alliance, outlined in Article 5, which ensures mutual defense if a member state is attacked. The article details NATO's expansion over the years, including the addition of former Warsaw Pact countries and, most recently, Sweden, while also highlighting the ongoing tensions with Russia over Ukraine's potential membership. The article clarifies NATO's open-door policy and the requirements for aspiring members to contribute to the alliance's security. </p>

          <p>Misti Leon is suing seven oil and gas companies for the wrongful death of her mother, Juliana Leon, who died during a Seattle heatwave in 2021. The lawsuit alleges that these companies knowingly contributed to climate change by manufacturing and marketing fossil fuels, leading to the extreme heat that caused Juliana's death. The filing seeks damages and a public education campaign to correct misinformation about the link between fossil fuels and climate change. This case is the first of its kind, potentially setting a precedent for individuals to seek compensation from fossil fuel corporations for their role in climate change, and will rely heavily on the science of weather attribution to prove the companies' responsibility. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans and the House are considering changes to the child tax credit as part of President Trump's spending bill. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 temporarily increased the child tax credit to $2,000, but this is set to expire after 2025. The Senate bill proposes permanently increasing the credit to $2,200 starting in 2025 and indexing it for inflation, while the House bill suggests a $2,500 credit from 2025 through 2028, which would then revert to $2,000. Policy experts note that neither version would significantly benefit the lowest-earning families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures. A study by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, with many potentially finding new habitats in the North Sea. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle, impacting ecosystems and food chains. The report emphasizes the need for careful management and reduced pressures like fishing and pollution to ensure these species thrive in new habitats. </p>

The lawsuits claim that Jones transferred cash, cars, and property to his ex-wife, father, and a trust for his children, actions that the trustee argues bear the hallmarks of fraudulent intent. Attorneys for the Sandy Hook families have accused Jones of 'shenanigans' to hide money, while Jones has claimed to be flat broke. </p>

          <p>A new CDC report indicates that street drug deaths in the U.S. are rising again after a period of decline, with preliminary data showing an increase of roughly 1,400 deaths in the 12-month period ending in January 2025. While still below the peak recorded in August 2023, this increase is troubling to addiction researchers, who suggest that the factors contributing to the recent drop in fatal overdoses may be fading. Most overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl, but researchers have warned of increasingly dangerous mixes of chemicals, including cocaine, methamphetamines, and veterinary tranquilizers. The rise in drug deaths comes as the Trump administration considers curtailing spending on addiction-related public health programs.</p>

          <p>Scientists and advocates in environmental health are expressing concerns about the Trump administration's actions, which appear to contradict the goals of the 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) agenda. Despite Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s emphasis on the health effects of toxic chemicals, the administration has made cuts to federally-funded research, weakened pollution safeguards, and hobbled agencies that investigate toxic substances. This disconnect is underscored by the MAHA report, which identifies environmental toxins as a key priority while simultaneously damaging the scientific community's ability to address these hazards. The administration's actions include yanking research grants, cutting staff at agencies like NIOSH and the CDC, and delaying regulations on PFAS and other harmful chemicals. </p>

          <p>UK inflation remains at 3.4%, the highest for more than a year, with chocolate prices rising at the fastest pace on record in May. Overall food prices have increased for the third consecutive month, with some economists suggesting that businesses are passing on recent increases in employer National Insurance payments to customers. Chocolate prices have been particularly affected by bad harvests in cocoa-producing regions, leading to a 17.7% increase in the year to May. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices in May. </p>

          <p>Tyler Perry is being sued for $260 million by an actor, Derek Dixon, who alleges sexual assault and harassment while working on Perry's TV shows. Dixon claims that Perry used his influence to create a coercive and sexually exploitative environment, making unwanted advances and threatening to kill off Dixon's character if he did not reciprocate. Perry's attorney denies the allegations, calling them a fabricated scam. </p>

          <p>An analysis by the Housing Ministry reveals that rents in large German cities have nearly doubled in the past 10 years, despite existing rent control laws. Berlin has seen the greatest rise in new rental prices at 107%, followed by Leipzig (67.7%) and Bremen (57%). Munich remains the most expensive city, with monthly rental prices reaching nearly â‚¬22 per square meter. Germany has laws in place to limit rents in regions with tight housing markets, but lessors are not subject to government supervision, requiring tenants to report suspected violations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. imposes duties on various countries, businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower their duty payments by altering materials or dimensions of products to fit into different harmonized system codes. This practice involves strategic design choices to create products that are subject to different tariff classifications and duty rates. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding fuzzy-felt fabric to the soles of sneakers to classify them as slippers. The practice is legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers. (not investment advice)</p>

Sacoolas left the UK under diplomatic immunity and later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving.
