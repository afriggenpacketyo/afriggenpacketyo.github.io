          <p>The memorial dedicated to the victims of the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, was vandalized, causing renewed grief and anger among the community. White wooden crosses bearing the names of the 19 children and two teachers killed in the 2022 massacre were damaged. Police Chief Homer Delgado condemned the act as cruel and senseless, vowing to hold those responsible accountable. The Robb Elementary site remains closed since the shooting and serves as a symbol of sorrow and resilience for the Uvalde community. The city recently approved a $2 million settlement for the families of the victims, marking the first financial compensation from lawsuits filed in response to the shooting.</p>

          <p>A major oil spill off the Louisiana Gulf Coast is raising alarms as DOGE job cuts may threaten response efforts. The leak, originating from a well blowout, is contaminating marshlands and threatening wildlife habitats and fisheries. While the exact amount of crude oil leaking is unknown, it could potentially reach major spill levels. Concerns are growing as NOAA, the agency responsible for addressing such spills, has experienced significant staff reductions due to DOGE and early retirements. The well, drilled in 1942 and capped in 2016, should have been plugged a decade ago, according to experts. Cleanup efforts are underway, with federal agencies taking control of the operation.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights per day, which is about 10% of its daily Newark hub schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and technology problems with the FAA. CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of air traffic controllers for Newark were absent after technology failures, making it impossible to handle the scheduled number of planes. The FAA has acknowledged staffing issues at Newark, and United is urging the agency to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has called for an all-new air traffic control system.</p>

Opposition parties, particularly the Workers' Party, have seen increased support, advocating for a more balanced political system. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who recently took office, emphasizes the need for experienced leadership to navigate trade tensions and U.S.-China relations.

Trump has faced increasing public dissatisfaction with his economic policies, particularly regarding tariffs, which economists predict will drive up inflation and slow growth.

Surveys indicate that high prices are a major concern for voters, with an acute housing shortage exacerbating public discontent.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its freeze on funds to Maine schools, resolving a dispute stemming from the state's support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funding for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration's actions, leading to a settlement in which the USDA agreed to restore the funds. The settlement ensures that Maine will continue to receive federal funding for its child nutrition program, which serves 172,000 children.</p>

          <p>Amid a significant measles outbreak, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading efforts to find treatments for the disease, particularly for those who "choose not to vaccinate." Kennedy, a known spreader of anti-vaccine misinformation, is directing the CDC to investigate measles treatments, despite decades of research showing no effective alternatives to vaccination. Kennedy has promoted unproven treatments like cod liver oil with vitamin A, which experts warn can cause liver damage in high doses. The American Academy of Pediatrics has criticized Kennedy's promotion of unrecommended medications, emphasizing that the most effective way to combat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for its representation of clients disfavored by Trump, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that produced the "Steele Dossier." Howell stated that the order sent the message that "lawyers must stick to the party line, or else," and that it was an attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man who intentionally injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to the development of an "unparalleled" antivenom. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's 18-year mission could pave the way for a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies in Friede's blood that target neurotoxins found in elapids, a family of venomous snakes. The resulting antivenom cocktail protected mice from lethal doses of 13 out of 19 snake species.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a national election, with President Trump's influence playing a significant role. The center-right Liberal-National Coalition, which had led in the polls, has seen its support plummet since Trump took office. Opposition leader Peter Dutton's campaign echoed Trump's messaging, focusing on the economy. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has adopted a moderate approach to Trump, refraining from direct criticism. The election results could lead to a minority government, with a third of voters opting for independents and minor parties. Trump's unpopularity in Australia has impacted the election, with distrust in the U.S. reaching a new low.</p>

          <p>President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency ventures has significantly increased his family's net worth, estimated to be around $2.9 billion, according to a new report. This surge is attributed to the launch of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, as well as a substantial stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange affiliated with the Trump family. An Abu Dhabi-backed firm is set to invest billions in World Liberty Financial, further boosting the family's wealth. Simultaneously, the Securities and Exchange Commission has paused investigations into several crypto companies since Trump's inauguration. Critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as Trump's administration loosens regulations on the digital currency industry while he profits from it. (not investment advice)</p>
