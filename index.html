          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to grant him the authority to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage contends that the current composition of the upper chamber exhibits a 'democratic disparity,' as Reform UK, despite its significant popular vote in the general election and recent local government gains, lacks any representation there. This contrasts with smaller parties that have numerous peers. While the Prime Minister holds discretion, a Downing Street spokesperson noted that appointments adhere to long-standing conventions and commission advice. Defence Secretary John Healey criticized Farage's request, citing his previous advocacy for abolishing the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>China's defense ministry spokesman Jiang Bin has expressed 'strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition' to the United States, lodging stern representations regarding an alleged 'infringement and provocation' near the Scarborough Shoal. Beijing urges the US to effectively restrain its frontline forces and immediately cease such acts, emphasizing the Chinese military's commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and regional peace. The Scarborough Shoal, known as Bajo de Masinloc in the Philippines and Huangyan Island in China, is a highly contested territory claimed by both nations, though it remains under Chinese control. This incident highlights ongoing tensions in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Germany has strongly condemned a new Israeli plan to construct 3,400 housing units in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank, asserting that it is illegal under international law. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that such settlement construction violates UN Security Council resolutions and severely complicates efforts for a two-state solution, as it would effectively divide Palestinian territory. Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the plan, openly stating it 'buries' the possibility of an independent Palestinian state. The international community, including the UN and EU, largely views Israeli settlements in these areas as illegal and a significant obstacle to achieving lasting peace.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to hold their first one-on-one meeting of Trump's second term in Anchorage, Alaska, against the backdrop of Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Their relationship has seen a notable shift, with Trump's initial praise for Putin evolving into recent expressions of 'disappointment' and frustration over the conflict. While Trump previously claimed he could end the war swiftly, experts suggest his expectations for this 'feel-out meeting' are now more moderated. The summit aims to explore options for a peaceful resolution, with Trump having hinted at 'severe consequences' if Russia does not cease hostilities.</p>

          <p>Aid agencies, including the World Food Programme (WFP), are issuing urgent warnings about a looming starvation crisis in Myanmar's war-torn Rakhine State, appealing for increased donations to avert a 'full-blown disaster.' The region, already devastated by past violence and a military blockade following the 2021 coup, faces significantly worse conditions than other areas, with food scarcity leading to tragic incidents of self-harm and death. The WFP reports a drastic 60% drop in global funding, severely limiting its ability to assist the rapidly increasing number of displaced and food-insecure people, particularly the Rohingya Muslims trapped in camps.</p>

          <p>A team of young Chinese scientists from Tsinghua University, led by Associate Professor Duan Ran, has developed a new approach that promises to overcome a 40-year-old mathematical barrier in theoretical computer science. Their research addresses the 'single-source shortest-paths' problem (SSSP), which traditionally relied on Dijkstra’s algorithm but faced speed limits due to its sorting process. The new method bypasses this by focusing only on the shortest distance between key points, significantly reducing calculation time. This development, published on arXiv and awarded the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, marks a notable advancement in computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, which formed in the eastern Atlantic, is on the verge of becoming the Atlantic season's first hurricane, with forecasters predicting it could strengthen into a major hurricane by the weekend. The U.S. National Hurricane Center reported Erin packing 70 mph winds, just shy of the 74 mph threshold for hurricane classification. The storm is projected to move near or north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend, though its longer-term path remains uncertain for the US mainland. While not an immediate threat to the contiguous US, flooding from the storm in Cabo Verde has already resulted in at least eight fatalities, prompting officials to declare a state of emergency.</p>

This policy is described as cruel, impacting industries already facing labor shortages and leaving DACA recipients in fear.

This criticism implicitly connects to the organization's broader issues, including its controversial handling of sexual assault allegations and safeguarding, which survivors report has led to retraumatization.

          <p>Major League Soccer (MLS) is facing growing scrutiny over its fan code of conduct, which bans political displays, leading to incidents like the eviction of a fan for wearing a 'Make America Great Again' hat and the confiscation of 'anti-ICE' banners. Critics argue the policy is vague, inconsistently enforced, and struggles to differentiate between political statements and human rights issues, particularly impacting Hispanic and Latin American fan bases targeted by immigration policies. While MLS aims for safe, apolitical venues, the league's unique position between global soccer norms and American sports culture creates a tightrope walk, often curtailing fans' ability to express views on pressing social and political matters.</p>

Despite voter concerns over issues like healthcare cuts and tax implications, as seen in Rep. Mike Flood's Nebraska town hall, Republicans consistently stick to talking points.

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of 800 US National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., framed as a crime crackdown but contradicted by federal data, is unlikely to be replicated in other US cities. Experts note that D.C. falls under federal jurisdiction, granting the president unique authority, unlike states where governors control their National Guard. While Trump has threatened interventions in cities like New York and Los Angeles, legal provisions for such actions outside federal property are limited, and a pending California court case could further restrict his scope. Critics, including the Congressional Black Caucus, view the D.C. intervention as an 'authoritarian push' and a politically motivated power grab targeting cities led by Black mayors.</p>

While Trump aims for a ceasefire, the form it takes and potential territorial concessions remain contentious, with Ukraine and European allies resisting any land-for-peace deals.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Tokyo to confront its history and 'make the right choice' regarding Taiwan. Wang emphasized that international documents following WWII clearly defined Japan's war responsibilities and required the return of territories, including Taiwan, asserting this as an 'unchallengeable outcome' of the anti-fascist war victory. He criticized 'some forces in Japan' for attempting to glorify aggression or distort history. This statement highlights ongoing geopolitical tensions and historical grievances between China and Japan, particularly concerning the sensitive issue of Taiwan's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates significantly divested from US-listed Chinese stocks in the second quarter, offloading stakes in major companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and JD.com. This strategic move signals a clear pullback from the Chinese market amid rising geopolitical tensions and weakening investor confidence in China's economic prospects. While founder Ray Dalio previously defended his China investments, he has recently called for a rebalancing in US-China relations to address trade imbalances. The divestment occurs as the tariff truce between Washington and Beijing was extended, yet it underscores persistent uncertainties and shifts in the global economic landscape.

          <p>Ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, speculation surrounds potential territorial changes in Ukraine, where Russia has controlled significant areas since 2014, including Crimea and parts of the Donbas. The article maps the evolving frontlines, noting Russia's current control of about 20% of Ukrainian territory, down from 27% in 2022. While Ukrainian President Zelenskyy demands an unconditional ceasefire, US President Trump has discussed 'territorial swaps,' causing concern in Kyiv and Europe. Reports suggest Russia might seek to retain control of Luhansk and Donetsk, potentially giving up Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, but Ukraine remains adamant against ceding any land.</p>

          <p>Global negotiations for a landmark treaty to end plastic pollution have once again failed, with the sixth round of UN talks concluding without an agreement. A fundamental division persists between about 100 nations advocating for curbs on plastic production and oil-producing states, backed by the plastics industry, pushing for a focus solely on recycling and waste management. Environmentalists and scientists warn that current recycling rates are insufficient to address the escalating crisis, emphasizing the need to tackle plastic at its source due to health and environmental risks. The collapse marks a missed opportunity, leaving the world further behind its goal of a legally binding accord.</p>

          <p>Carlsberg CEO Aarup-Andersen notes a 'bifurcation' in beer consumption habits, as cost pressures lead consumers to increasingly choose either premium or economy brands, squeezing core beer brands. This trend, coupled with declining sales volumes across the brewing industry, reflects a broader 'spending pause' among consumers. While premium and alcohol-free products are growing, the on-trade sector (bars and restaurants) is suffering, with at-home consumption gaining ground due to rising pint prices. Brewers like Carlsberg, AB InBev, and Heineken are navigating these macroeconomic headwinds, though some CEOs maintain optimism about the beer category's overall resilience despite the shifting landscape.
