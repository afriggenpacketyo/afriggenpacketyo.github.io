          <p>Advocates and experts are warning that the diverse branding of Medicaid programs across different states could lead to widespread confusion among recipients. With names like "Healthy Indiana Plan" or "SoonerCare," many people may not realize these are Medicaid programs and could unknowingly lose their health coverage during eligibility reviews. This issue is particularly critical as states continue the process of redetermining eligibility for millions of Americans following the end of pandemic-era continuous coverage policies.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods have ravaged Texas's hill country, with the Guadalupe River rising an astonishing 26 feet in under an hour, causing multiple fatalities and prompting extensive water rescues. A significant focus of concern is Camp Mystic, a summer camp where around 20 children were reported unaccounted for following what officials described as a "catastrophic level" of flooding. The lieutenant governor has confirmed that search and recovery efforts are ongoing for all those missing in the disaster.</p>

          <p>A new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction. This provision allows seniors aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold to claim a deduction of up to $6,000. Policy experts clarify this measure offers some relief but falls short of a full tax repeal and disproportionately benefits higher-income seniors, while potentially adding to Social Security's long-term financial strain.

          <p>Hamas has reportedly issued a "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal, even as Israeli military operations in Gaza intensified, killing at least 138 Palestinians. The proposed 60-day deal, which President Trump indicated Israel has agreed to, focuses on the return of Israeli hostages. However, Hamas is seeking guarantees for a permanent end to the war and an Israeli military withdrawal, conditions that have been obstacles in past negotiations, highlighting the fragile nature of the current talks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force has suspended a proposed collaboration with SpaceX to test hypersonic rocket deliveries from Johnston Atoll, a remote Pacific wildlife refuge. The decision follows strong opposition from biologists and environmental groups who raised concerns about the project's potential harm to the 14 species of tropical seabirds that nest on the atoll. The program, aimed at creating a rapid global military logistics capability, is now on hold as the Air Force reportedly seeks alternative locations.</p>
