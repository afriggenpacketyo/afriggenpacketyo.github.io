          <p>The Trump administration has reached a settlement in principle with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot while breaching the House Speaker's Lobby during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. This settlement averts a trial in the $30 million civil suit filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of Babbitt's estate, which alleged negligence by U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd. Babbitt's death became a rallying point for Trump loyalists, who claimed unnecessary force was used, while the Justice Department argued Babbitt unlawfully entered the Capitol. The U.S. Capitol Police internal review defended Byrd's actions as potentially saving members of Congress and staff from serious injury. Optimism score: 45</p>

This decision follows Amazon's recent earnings report, which exceeded expectations for profit and revenue but projected lower-than-expected operating income for the current quarter.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 includes significant cuts to non-defense discretionary spending, while increasing defense spending to over $1 trillion. The proposal aims to reduce non-defense spending by $163 billion from current levels, with agencies potentially facing an average of 35% cuts, although some entities like the Department of Homeland Security would receive more funding. The budget prioritizes defense and homeland security while reducing foreign aid and other discretionary programs.

          <p>An oil spill off the coast of Louisiana is raising alarms as cuts within the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may threaten response efforts. The leak, originating from a well blowout, is contaminating marshlands and endangering wildlife habitats. Job cuts at NOAA, including the Emergency Response Division, have reduced the agency's ability to respond effectively. Witnesses describe a geyser of oil shooting into the air, with cleanup crews working to contain the spill. The incident highlights concerns about aging infrastructure and the Trump administration's push for expanded offshore drilling. Optimism score: 20</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's push to secure domestic mineral supplies faces a paradox: while easing regulations to boost mining, the administration is undermining the clean-tech manufacturing markets that would drive demand for those minerals. Cuts to the Loan Programs Office, tariffs on imports, and potential repeal of electric-vehicle tax credits are jeopardizing clean-energy projects. This approach risks hindering the development of a domestic mineral supply chain, as companies need a clear demand signal to justify investment in mining and processing.
