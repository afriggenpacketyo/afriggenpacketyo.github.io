          <p>President Trump declared his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it's a national security threat due to other countries incentivizing filmmakers to leave America. The Motion Picture Association has declined to comment. The move's specifics are unclear, including whether it would affect foreign-language films, movies on streaming services, or films with scenes shot overseas. Trump previously appointed film ambassadors to bring Hollywood business back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering imposing tariffs on foreign-made films, claiming that Hollywood is being "devastated" by filmmakers and studios working overseas. If implemented, this would be the first time a Trump tariff is imposed on services rather than manufactured goods. The move is framed as a response to other nations offering incentives to attract film productions, which Trump considers a national security threat.</p>
