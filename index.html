          <p>Hamas has communicated its acceptance of key parts of a Gaza peace plan outlined by the US president, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the proposal require further negotiation. U.S. officials view the response as a positive step, while Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, which involves an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line. The deal aims to establish a lasting peace and transfer Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body.</p>

          <p>Representative Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, is deliberately avoiding engagement with the New York City mayoral race and its progressive nominee, Zohran Mamdani. Sherrill states her focus is entirely on New Jersey issues like affordability and infrastructure, such as the Gateway Tunnel project. This move is seen as a strategy to sidestep the political controversy surrounding Mamdani's democratic socialist platform, which Republicans are using to criticize vulnerable Democrats. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, has accused her of attempting to evade a clear stance on the matter.</p>

He narrowly beat Red Bull's Verstappen, who will start second, while McLaren's championship leader Piastri will start third. The result positions Russell favorably for the race and disrupts the expected battle between the McLaren teammates.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the human smuggling prosecution against Kilmar Ábrego García may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. This decision follows Ábrego García's successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The judge cited "cause for concern" based on statements from administration officials and the timing of the charges, which were filed shortly after the Supreme Court ordered his return to the U.S. The case highlights the intense partisan conflict surrounding the administration's immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>The luxury department store Harrods has set aside more than £60 million to compensate individuals who allege they were victims of historical abuse by its former owner, Mohamed Al Fayed. The redress scheme, open until March 2026, is expected to handle claims from over 100 former employees, with individual payments potentially reaching up to £385,000. This initiative follows numerous allegations of sexual assault against Fayed, who passed away in 2023. The significant financial provision has contributed to Harrods reporting a £34.3 million loss in its latest annual accounts.</p>

The protests, led by the Awami Action Committee, were driven by public anger over high living costs and benefits for the political elite.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has detailed the development of new unmanned underwater systems described as "disruptive" and intelligent. These systems are reportedly capable of operating below 90 decibels, making them difficult for enemy sonar to detect. The article suggests these platforms can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to create a comprehensive, multi-layered strike network. The disclosure points to significant advancements in China's naval capabilities and its focus on asymmetric warfare technologies to enhance its maritime power.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has left the national park system in a state of confusion, with many facilities closed and thousands of employees furloughed. While some parks remain partially accessible, critical services like maintenance and visitor support are suspended, leading to visitor frustration and potential safety risks. This situation mirrors the 2018 shutdown, which resulted in environmental damage and safety issues at popular parks like Joshua Tree.

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain due to a significant drop in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies.

The decline is attributed to factors including stricter visa screening processes and fears of deportation among students, particularly following campus protests.

          <p>Jon Godfread, North Dakota's Republican insurance commissioner, is warning that time is running out to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before the upcoming open enrollment period. The issue is a central point of contention in the ongoing government shutdown. Godfread argues that failing to act before November 1 will cause health insurance premiums to skyrocket for millions, potentially pricing them out of the market and destabilizing the insurance risk pool. He emphasizes that there is bipartisan support among state insurance commissioners for extending the tax credits to prevent massive coverage disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Munich Airport experienced two separate shutdowns within 24 hours due to confirmed drone sightings near its runways, affecting thousands of passengers. The airport reopened Saturday morning, but delays were expected to continue. This incident is the latest in a series of mysterious drone overflights at airports and other critical infrastructure sites across several European Union countries. The incursions have prompted European authorities to discuss a coordinated drone detection and defense plan to address the growing security threat posed by unidentified drones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's new album has sparked intense fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song addresses another singer who writes about hating Swift, which fans have linked to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying the album, Swift described the track as a "love letter to someone who hates you," finding it flattering that someone would devote so much attention to her. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation, but it has fueled online debate about a potential rivalry.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance its operational efficiency, improve corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and a high customer retention rate, Workiva's lack of profitability has led to its stock trading at a discount compared to its peers. Irenic has also requested two new board seats to help oversee these proposed changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is ramping up production to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This revival is driven by the need to power AI data centers and a U.S. ban on Russian uranium imports, which previously supplied 20% of the nation's needs. The facility is expanding its capacity by 15% to help fill the supply gap, but industry leaders warn that the entire nuclear fuel supply chain, from mining to conversion, requires significant expansion.

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party is gathering for its annual conference amid deep unpopularity and questions about its political relevance following a major election defeat. Under the leadership of Kemi Badenoch, the party has failed to gain traction and faces a challenge from the ascendant Reform UK party. Many Conservatives are privately critical of Badenoch's leadership, suggesting she has not connected with the public or set a clear direction. The conference is seen as a crucial opportunity for Badenoch to assert her authority and convince both her party and the country that the Conservatives still matter.</p>

Her election is seen as a move by the LDP to win back conservative voters after recent election losses.

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after she insisted on receiving early screenings. Although initially told she was too young, a high-risk assessment led to a mammogram and a breast MRI, which detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, especially as breast cancer rates are rising in women under 50. Her oncologist credits her persistence with catching the cancer at a highly treatable stage.</p>

          <p>The late primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the natural world. Her journey began in the 1960s when, without formal training, she immersed herself in the lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Her revolutionary discovery that chimps make and use tools blurred the line between humans and other animals, forcing a redefinition of what it means to be human. Her friendship with a chimp named David Greybeard symbolized a new potential for interspecies understanding and fueled her lifelong dedication to conservation.</p>
