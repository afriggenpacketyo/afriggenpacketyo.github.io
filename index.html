          <p>A prosecutor has been removed from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, marking the latest departure from the high-profile office. This follows the recent resignations and firings of other senior prosecutors in the same office, which is handling politically sensitive cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The shakeup has raised concerns about the independence and stability of the Justice Department, particularly after a former prosecutor warned his firing could jeopardize a major national security case.</p>

          <p>Members of the U.S. Air Force team that conducted stealth bomber strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have shared details about the high-stakes mission. The operation, codenamed "Midnight Hammer," involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying a 36-hour mission from Missouri to hit three underground targets with 30,000-pound bombs. Commanders described the mission's execution as "perfect," highlighting the B-2's unique combination of long-range capability, heavy payload, and stealth technology, which was supported by F-22 and F-35 fighter escorts. The account follows a presidential announcement of an order for 28 new B-2 bombers.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new content restrictions for Instagram users under the age of 18, aligning the platform's standards with those of a PG-13 movie rating. The new default setting will block teens from seeing search results for sensitive topics like "gore" or "alcohol" and prevent them from following or interacting with accounts that frequently post age-inappropriate material. The update also extends these regulations to Instagram's integrated AI, ensuring its responses are age-appropriate, and introduces an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for parents.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed that Hamas has returned the bodies of four more deceased hostages, which were transferred via the Red Cross. This development occurred after Israel threatened to restrict humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza until the remains of all 28 deceased hostages were returned as stipulated in the recent ceasefire agreement. The exchange is part of a broader U.S.-brokered peace plan, though tensions remain as Hamas has cited difficulties in locating all the remains, a point that could test the fragile truce.</p>

          <p>While a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is largely holding, significant challenges are testing the agreement's stability. International aid organizations, including the Red Cross, are urgently calling for all border crossings to be opened to address the severe humanitarian crisis and allow essential supplies and rebuilding materials into the devastated territory. Concurrently, pressure is mounting on Hamas to return the remains of 24 deceased Israeli hostages, a key stipulation of the deal that has become a major point of contention and could jeopardize further progress toward a lasting peace.</p>

Recent data already shows a significant rise in furniture prices, and these new duties are expected to further impact households building or remodeling homes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Armenia in a heated World Cup qualifier, with the decisive moment being a red card shown to Armenian captain Tigran Barseghyan. Barseghyan was dismissed early in the second half for headbutting Irish midfielder Finn Azaz during a sideline clash. Playing with a one-man advantage, Ireland capitalized when Evan Ferguson scored the winning goal, keeping their qualification hopes alive. Azaz commented that Barseghyan "lost his head," a mistake that ultimately changed the course of the vital match.</p>

          <p>Up to 31,000 Kaiser Permanente healthcare workers in California and Hawaii have launched a five-day strike, demanding better pay and solutions to chronic staffing shortages. The union, UNAC/UHCP, is seeking a 25% wage increase over four years to address inflation and worker burnout, arguing that current staffing levels compromise patient care. Kaiser Permanente has called the strike "disruptive" and its wage demands "out of step with economic realities," offering a 21.5% raise instead. The healthcare provider has hired temporary staff to maintain services during the walkout.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control its entire business stack, from chip design to consumer hardware, in a strategic pivot that mirrors Apple's ecosystem approach. A new partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators is the latest move, designed to optimize infrastructure specifically for its own models and reduce reliance on third parties like Nvidia. This, combined with the acquisition of Jony Ive's design firm for AI-native devices and massive infrastructure investments, shows OpenAI is betting that owning the hardware, developer platform, and models will secure its long-term dominance.
