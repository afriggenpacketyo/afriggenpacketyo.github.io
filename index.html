          <p>Australia's Kangaroos secured a commanding 26-6 victory against England in the opening Rugby League Ashes match, resuming their long-standing dominance in the series after a 22-year hiatus. The Kangaroos established an early lead with a contentious try and further extended it post-interval through scores from Reece Walsh and a double from Angus Crichton, ultimately cruising to a comfortable win. Despite England's late consolation, Australia maintained control throughout the game. A notable downside for the visitors was their captain Issah Yeo being forced off due to a head injury, highlighting the match's intense physicality. This article provides a detailed account of the game's key plays and the Kangaroos' commanding performance in the significant return of the Ashes.</p>

          <p>A journalist embarked on an investigative quest to locate the physical remnants of the White House East Wing, which was recently demolished under President Trump's directive to construct a new ballroom. The search began at East Potomac Park, where dirt from the demolition was reportedly being used to create a new golf course hole, though official confirmation from site workers was elusive and contradictory. The investigation then extended to an industrial park in Hyattville, Maryland, where employees were notably reluctant to confirm the presence of White House debris, citing instructions not to speak to the press. This article details the challenges and secrecy surrounding the disposal of materials from a significant historical building.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has abruptly terminated trade negotiations with Canada, citing a negative TV advertisement from the Canadian province of Ontario regarding tariffs. This decision could significantly impact consumer prices for goods like home appliances, cars, and auto parts, as trade experts anticipate existing steel and aluminum tariffs will remain in effect. Canada, the primary exporter of these materials to the U.S., had been seeking to reduce or lift these levies. This article details the geopolitical context of Trump's move and its potential economic ramifications for both nations, especially with the USMCA agreement up for review next year.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is poised to become Ireland's next president after her rival, Heather Humphreys of the center-right Fine Gael party, conceded defeat ahead of the official result. Connolly, a 68-year-old former barrister and independent lawmaker, secured strong voter support and the backing of several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin, partly due to her outspoken criticism of Israel over the war in Gaza. While the Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, representing the country and fulfilling constitutional duties, this article highlights her significant victory and its potential implications for future political alignments in Ireland.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investing strategy, often referred to as 'VOO and chill' (buying index-tracking ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), is reportedly losing its appeal among investors, even with stocks at all-time highs. Financial experts observe that clients are actively seeking greater diversification, as the S&P 500's heavy concentration in technology stocks, now over 35%, reduces its benchmark effectiveness. This shift is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

The median price per square foot for Manhattan condos has remained essentially flat over the last decade, and when factoring in inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the true losses for sellers are likely even greater. This trend sharply contrasts with the substantial national home price increases seen since the pandemic.

Instead, Wambach recommends emphasizing leadership and teamwork during games, encouraging children to reflect on non-score-related "wins."

          <p>The article explores America's enduring fascination with serial killers, despite a significant decline in their actual numbers since the 1970s, as highlighted by a criminologist. Recent rumors of a "Rainey Street Ripper" in Austin, Texas, were debunked by a university study, with authorities attributing numerous drownings to alcohol and drug consumption rather than a serial murderer. Criminologists point to advancements like DNA technology, increased public awareness, and reduced street prostitution as key factors in the decline of serial killings. However, public interest persists, fueled by true crime entertainment and a societal need to project meaning onto "monsters," as this article delves into the cultural and psychological aspects of this obsession.</p>
