          <p>The Ukraine war is reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, notably seen in a US-brokered peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia, signaling Russia's waning influence. Azerbaijan is forging new alliances with Turkey and Central Asian nations, asserting independence while experiencing strained relations with Russia after a plane crash incident. Other ex-Soviet states like Tajikistan are also openly challenging Moscow, with China quietly expanding its regional influence by guaranteeing sovereignty and security. These developments suggest a significant rebalancing of power dynamics in the post-Soviet space.</p>

          <p>A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City rolled over on the New York State Thruway, resulting in five deaths and numerous injuries. State police confirmed the bus lost control, entered the median, over-corrected, and landed in a ditch, ruling out mechanical failure and operator impairment. Victims were identified as individuals from India, New Jersey, and Beijing, with many passengers being of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationalities. The accident prompted road closures and a coordinated emergency response, with several hospitals treating the injured, some critically.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under the Trump administration is not defending a long-standing grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), deeming it unconstitutional. This move supports a lawsuit by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, arguing the program provides an unlawful advantage based on race or ethnicity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court decision against affirmative action. Over 500 colleges, including major universities, are designated HSIs, receiving about $350 million in federal funding. Critics argue this decision undermines efforts to support institutions that disproportionately serve Latino students and puts their funding at risk.</p>

          <p>Republican public safety advocate Gianno Caldwell is exploring a run for the open Illinois Senate seat in 2026, focusing on law and order. Caldwell, whose brother was killed in a 2022 Chicago drive-by shooting, emphasizes his mission to save lives and applauds President Trump's efforts to deploy federal agents to combat crime in cities like Chicago. This potential bid comes as Senator Dick Durbin retires, opening the race, and amid a political debate over federal intervention in local policing, which has drawn backlash from Democratic leaders like Mayor Muriel Bowser. Caldwell believes Chicagoans are "begging for change" regarding their crime woes.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures of up to 30C on bank holiday Monday, making it potentially one of the hottest summers on record, before the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring unsettled weather. Large crowds are expected at events like Notting Hill Carnival and music festivals. However, the warm spell is predicted to be short-lived, with wind and rain developing from Tuesday.

          <p>An Air Canada flight from Toronto to Las Vegas was diverted to Chicago's O'Hare Airport overnight due to a disruptive passenger. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the safe landing after the crew reported the disturbance. While the specific actions of the passenger were not detailed, the incident was resolved without an arrest, and the flight resumed its journey, arriving in Las Vegas three hours late. This event adds to over 1,000 unruly passenger incidents reported by airlines this year, with violators facing potential civil penalties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to construction on the Revolution Wind project near Rhode Island, despite it being approximately 80% complete with 45 of 65 turbines installed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified "national security interests" for the stop-work order. This action aligns with President Trump's broader agenda to prioritize fossil fuels and impede renewable energy, which he has publicly criticized as a "scam." Rhode Island and Connecticut governors, both Democrats, condemned the decision, emphasizing the project's importance for their states' climate goals and considering legal action against this significant setback for the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across the UK concerning the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with demonstrations in major cities and smaller towns. Anti-migrant groups were often met by counter-protests from anti-racism campaigners, leading to police intervention to maintain separation and several arrests for various offenses. This wave of protests follows a High Court ruling that blocked a hotel in Epping from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local authorities to consider legal challenges. The government states its commitment to closing asylum hotels in a managed way, with numbers increasing since Labour took power but down from a 2023 peak.</p>

Experts warn these volatile, yield-focused products, such as covered call ETFs, can be "train wrecks" if underlying stocks falter. The influx of retail money chasing returns into these niche strategies is considered a contrarian signal for the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retirement Dilemma: Staying on to Train Replacement and Impact on Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 66-year-old nearing retirement faces a dilemma as his company requests he stay on part-time for two months to train his replacement, hired weeks before his planned exit. This situation raises questions about the impact on retirement benefits, particularly Social Security, which can be temporarily reduced if income exceeds a certain cap before full retirement age. Delaying Social Security claims can increase future benefits, and a short-term consulting gig could slightly boost average earnings used for calculations. The article advises considering these financial implications and the potential to retain employer-provided health insurance longer before making a decision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has significantly expanded a previous order, blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to 34 "sanctuary cities" and counties, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, and Denver. Judge William Orrick ruled that withholding Housing and Urban Development grants from jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement is unconstitutional. This legal challenge comes amidst the administration's increased efforts to crack down on sanctuary policies, including deploying the National Guard to Washington D.C. and potentially Chicago. The number of people in immigration detention has also soared by over 50% since Trump's inauguration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 17 major US hospital systems in nine states and Washington D.C., including Kaiser Permanente and Children's National Hospital, are ending some or all pediatric gender-affirming care services for minors. This widespread cessation follows a Trump administration executive order to halt funding and support for gender transitions for those under 19, citing "escalating legal and regulatory risks." While proponents argue gender-affirming care is crucial for mental health and backed by medical associations, critics cite weak evidence and potential risks. The move is seen by advocates as government overreach interfering with patient-doctor decisions, potentially causing significant psychosocial setbacks for affected youth.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to carry firearms, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous stance that troops would not be armed, raising concerns among local officials and residents, with polls showing the deployment is deeply unpopular. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force, declared D.C. "safe" and suggested expanding the mission to Chicago, despite Mayor Brandon Johnson's strong opposition to federal intervention. The administration is considering declaring a national emergency to prolong the deployment.</p>

Her testimony, some heavily redacted, comes as the Trump administration faces pressure for transparency regarding Epstein, and amid her move to a new minimum-security facility, though the White House denies any leniency discussions.</p>

The launch, tied to the "honour of the Rocket Force," underscores the PLA's ongoing commitment to maintaining a robust nuclear counterstrike force.

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has erupted again, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December, with lava arcing 100 feet into the air within its summit crater. The eruption, contained within the crater, poses no threat to homes and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied to a lower chamber, building pressure until it forces out through narrow vents, creating the towering fountains. This repeated eruptive pattern has occurred only four times in 200 years, making it a significant ongoing geological event.</p>

          <p>Auto expert Chris Pyle identifies six SUVs that become financially burdensome after their warranty expires, often due to massive depreciation, high maintenance, or frequent mechanical failures. He advises against buying Land Rover Range Rovers, most Nissan SUVs (due to CVT issues), Lincoln Aviators (electronics/depreciation), GMC Yukons (engine risks/fuel economy), VW Tiguans (oil consumption/infotainment), and Jeep Compasses (fundamental design flaws). Pyle recommends leasing these vehicles or planning to sell them before the warranty ends to avoid significant post-warranty repair bills and depreciation hits. This practical advice aims to help consumers minimize long-term ownership costs.</p>

The Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to help the party retain its narrow House majority in 2026. Democrats have vowed legal challenges, arguing the map dilutes minority voting power. This mid-decade redistricting effort, urged by President Trump, has also spurred California Governor Gavin Newsom to introduce a counter-plan to flip five Republican seats to Democratic.</p>

However, parole boards cited Erik's history of prison misconduct, including fights, drug use, and a tax-fraud scam, and Lyle's ongoing "anti-social personality traits" like deception and rule-breaking, including repeated mobile phone violations. The panels concluded that despite their remorse, their institutional behavior and underlying issues warranted continued incarceration.</p>
