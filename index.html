          <h2>Tesla's Australian Sales Surge in May Amid Global Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian electric vehicle sales in May, reaching a 12-month high, despite facing declining sales in the U.S. and Europe. The surge was primarily driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV, with a 122.5% year-over-year increase. While total deliveries in Australia rose by 9.3% compared to the previous year, they surged over 675% from April. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year, indicating that the Australian rebound does not necessarily signal a broader global recovery. The score reflects the regional success against a backdrop of wider market struggles.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in Sunday's attack in Boulder, had attempted to purchase a handgun in November but was denied due to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

His wife and children are in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and are being processed for expedited removal. The attack involved throwing Molotov cocktails at a demonstration advocating for hostages being held in Gaza, and sixteen unused Molotov cocktails were found within "armâ€™s reach" of the suspect upon his arrest.</p>

She humorously mentioned her upcoming surgery as a "very dramatic way to get a boob job" and plans to take some time off before returning with new music.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a replenishment oiler named after the gay rights activist and Korean War veteran. The decision, which U.S. officials claim aligns with President Trump and Hegseth's goal to "re-establish the warrior culture," is part of a broader effort to remove references to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the move, highlighting Milk's service and legacy. The ship, christened in 2021, was intended to honor leaders who fought for civil and human rights, making the renaming a controversial decision.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest in the city's history, involved closing off a large area of the city center, including the old town, several hotels, and key infrastructure. The bombs, two 200-pound and one 100-pound, were discovered in the Deutz district, a frequent target during the war. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the extensive Allied bombing campaigns during World War II, highlighting the enduring legacy of the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. Critics argue that these protections could disrupt steel producers outside the U.S., provoke retaliation from trade partners, and increase costs for American consumers. The UK has been granted an exemption, maintaining tariffs at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the increased tariffs could lead to job losses in sectors reliant on these metals and raise prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's recent drone attack on military airfields inside Russia has highlighted vulnerabilities in modern warfare. The successful mission, dubbed Operation Spider's Web, demonstrated how inexpensive, off-the-shelf drones can evade defenses and inflict significant damage on expensive military hardware. This attack serves as a reminder that military bases and critical assets worldwide are at risk from similar asymmetric attacks. The innovative use of technology is likely to inspire other groups to adopt similar tactics against well-funded adversaries.</p>

          <p>More than 15 former Indiana men's basketball players have alleged improper sexual conduct by a former team physician, Dr. Bradford Bomba, including claims of unnecessary rectal exams. The players claim that university officials, including the late coach Bobby Knight, were aware of Bomba's behavior but failed to intervene. A lawsuit has been filed, alleging that Bomba regularly performed rectal exams on male athletes despite medical guidance not recommending them for college-age men. The university has commissioned an investigation, but the allegations continue to raise concerns about the safety and well-being of student-athletes.</p>

The controversy highlights the government's reluctance to confront its complicity in the human rights violations in Gaza, as well as its prioritization of security alliances over moral obligations.</p>
