          <p>A new study by Memorial Sloan Kettering suggests immunotherapy could replace chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation for some cancers. Nearly 80% of patients with various cancer types were successfully treated with immunotherapy alone, including 100% of rectal cancer patients in the trial. The treatment involves checkpoint inhibitors that "unmask" tumor cells, allowing the patient's immune system to recognize and kill them. Researchers noted that some original participants from a 2022 trial remain cancer-free, and the immunotherapy-only approach has been incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's treatment guidelines.</p>

It raises concerns that Musk could use his influence to evade oversight and avoid legal liabilities.

          <p>President Trump's efforts to reshape the global economic order through trade wars and treaty withdrawals have caused significant disruptions. These changes include provoking trade conflicts and dismantling governmental infrastructure, making them difficult to reverse. The world is still in flux, and future elections could shift the political landscape, but undoing the Trump administration's actions presents a considerable challenge. The long-term effects of these policies will continue to be felt for years to come.</p>

          <p>The Fall of Saigon is remembered through the accounts of those who witnessed the chaotic evacuation of Americans and South Vietnamese civilians as North Vietnamese forces advanced. The U.S. Embassy became a last refuge, with civilians desperately seeking evacuation. Marines were ordered to lower the American flag, signaling the end of America's war in Vietnam. The final helicopter evacuations left some Vietnamese behind, and Marines were initially left on the roof of the embassy before being rescued, marking a poignant and tragic end to the conflict.</p>
