          <p>The UK government has begun detaining dozens of migrants who crossed the English Channel as part of a new pilot deportation agreement with France. Under the "one in, one out" deal, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept a vetted asylum seeker who has not attempted an illegal crossing. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those detained are eligible for immediate return within weeks, and the government is prepared for legal challenges. The 11-month pilot program is a key part of the Labour government's strategy to secure the nation's borders, though it faces criticism from conservatives who favor the previous administration's Rwanda plan.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the construction of a new migrant detention facility at Fort Bliss, Texas, which will become the largest of its kind in the United States with a capacity for 5,000 people. Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson confirmed that construction began in July to support the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. The facility is part of a broader strategy that includes other state-level centers, such as Indiana's "Speedway Slammer" and Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz," funded by recent legislation. This initiative aims to increase detention capacity significantly as the administration continues its nationwide deportation operations and encourages voluntary self-deportation.</p>

          <p>Brian Driscoll, who briefly served as acting FBI director, is among several senior officials being pushed out of the bureau without a stated cause, according to sources. Driscoll and Steve Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the Washington field office, were reportedly told to vacate their roles by Friday. In an internal email, Driscoll confirmed his termination but stated he was given no reason for the decision. The FBI Agents Association expressed deep concern over the summary firings, stating that agents are entitled to a review process and that the association is exploring legal options to defend its members.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a new wave of sweeping tariffs on imports from dozens of countries now in effect, economists predict negative consequences for both businesses and consumers. Experts say companies are unlikely to absorb the increased costs indefinitely, leading to higher prices on a wide range of goods and services. Major corporations like Toyota, General Motors, and Ford have already reported or projected significant profit reductions due to the new duties. While the Trump administration argues the tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters and will bolster the US economy, analysts maintain that American importers and consumers will ultimately bear the financial brunt of the policy.</p>

His comments came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated an intent to take control of Gaza before handing it to Arab forces. Huckabee also commented on the complete breakdown of ceasefire negotiations, blaming Hamas for a lack of seriousness and suggesting the only alternative is their military defeat. He further addressed the investigation into the deaths of American citizens in the West Bank and the challenges of delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

The results position the company to seek regulatory approval from the FDA later this year, potentially making the pill available by 2026. While the efficacy is comparable to popular injectable GLP-1 drugs like Zepbound, the pill form is expected to be cheaper and more accessible. The most common side effects reported were gastrointestinal issues, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue the trial.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to review regulations that could pave the way for including alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) retirement plans. This move could unlock trillions of dollars in retirement savings for these markets, a long-sought goal for the private equity and crypto industries. Proponents argue it provides workers with more investment choices, while critics warn it could expose savers to riskier, more volatile, and less transparent assets.

The administration argues the injunction harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to stop construction at a controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups who argue that the facility's construction violates federal law by proceeding without an environmental impact statement. The judge's order halts building activities like paving and fencing for 14 days but does not affect ongoing detention operations. The lawsuit contends that the facility, located in the Big Cypress National Preserve, harms the fragile ecosystem and the habitat of the endangered Florida panther.</p>

          <p>This week's major film release is "Freakier Friday," a sequel to the 2003 body-swap comedy, which sees the return of stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. This article's review finds their chemistry remains a high point, though the plot becomes confusing with the addition of new body-swapping characters. Also reviewed is "Weapons," a highly original and ambitious mystery-thriller from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, which evolves into a disturbing horror film centered on the disappearance of 17 middle-school students. Finally, the independent horror film "Shaman" is noted for its unique Ecuadorian Andes setting and its exploration of cultural and religious clashes.</p>

          <p>The Stanford Daily, the student newspaper of Stanford University, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that threats to deport foreign students for their political speech are chilling free expression on campus. The lawsuit claims these threats have hampered the newspaper's ability to cover campus protests related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, as students on visas fear speaking on the record. The suit accuses the administration of prioritizing its authority to revoke visas over the First Amendment, citing cases where foreign students at other universities were arrested for participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 represents a strategic shift in the AI race, focusing as much on usability and user experience as on raw intelligence. This analysis suggests that while GPT-5 shows state-of-the-art performance, its real breakthrough is in creating a more intuitive, personalized, and frictionless product that consolidates previous features into one seamless model. By making the advanced model free with usage limits and adding personalization features, OpenAI aims to attract and retain a massive user base, making its ecosystem difficult to leave. The strategy is to build an indispensable artificial general assistant before achieving the more distant goal of artificial general intelligence.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali has resigned from her position as the UK's homelessness minister following accusations of hypocrisy regarding a rental property she owns. The controversy arose after it was reported that she ended her tenants' contract to sell the house, only to re-list it for rent at a higher price within six months. This action is something a new government bill, which she was responsible for, aims to outlaw. In her resignation letter, Ali insisted she followed all legal requirements but stated that remaining in the role would be a "distraction" for the government, which has faced criticism over the incident.</p>

          <p>US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is facing sharp criticism from the scientific community after revealing plans to "update" the nation's premier climate assessment reports. Scientists fear the Trump administration will replace rigorous, peer-reviewed data with misinformation to downplay the climate crisis and support its pro-fossil fuel agenda. Wright claimed past reports "weren't fair" and needed to be fixed, a move one prominent climate scientist compared to the actions of Joseph Stalin. The Union of Concerned Scientists warned that altering these congressionally mandated reports would bury scientific evidence and leave the public in harm's way.</p>

          <p>A political standoff is unfolding in Texas, where Democratic legislators have fled the state to block Republicans from redrawing congressional maps in a mid-decade redistricting effort. This analysis explores how this brazen political maneuver, aimed at securing more GOP seats, reflects a broader trend of "total politics," where any legal tool is used for partisan advantage, regardless of long-term consequences. The fight has already inspired similar threats in other states, potentially leading to a nationwide battle over gerrymandering. The article argues this self-perpetuating problem undermines representative governance and threatens the fundamental meaning of the right to vote.</p>
