          <p>Despite a U.S. port fee aimed at ships connected to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards due to their unmatched competitiveness. MSC's senior vice-president stated that the port fee wouldn't deter them from ordering more vessels from China, emphasizing China's competence and capability in shipbuilding, especially for vessels needed for the energy transition. While acknowledging the U.S.'s efforts to revive its shipbuilding sector, she noted that it would require state subsidies and the retention of strategic assets and would not happen overnight. The International Maritime Organisation wants the global shipping industry to achieve net-zero emissions in the next 25 years or so.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the victory of a horse named Journalism at the Preakness Stakes, highlighting the importance of patience and strategic timing. Journalism, initially trapped on the rail, demonstrated composure and resilience by waiting for an opportunity to advance. After a hard bump, the horse found a narrow opening and surged ahead to win by a half length, proving that victories can be earned through calculated moves rather than reckless speed. Journalism is now headed to the Belmont Stakes, where the horse's performance will be etched into memory.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's criticism of President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" has sparked a conflict with Republican lawmakers, who are standing firm against his demands for a new piece of legislation. Musk's influence and rapid pivot on the bill have created challenges for Republicans, with some expressing frustration over his vague criticism and lack of productive feedback. Democrats are viewing Musk's opposition as an opportunity to sidetrack the legislation, while some Republicans believe the Congressional Budget Office's deficit estimate is what set off Musk. Despite the political contretemps, Republicans remain determined to pass the bill, with House Speaker Mike Johnson emphasizing that they "can't go back to the drawing board."</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, where the economy expanded 7.4% year-on-year. However, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting concerns about a potential slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The RBI had previously highlighted growth concerns amidst the threat of tariffs from the United States, and the rate cut also comes as India's inflation is largely on a downtrend.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman is significant due to his central role in the party's rise since the general election. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, brought financial support, a minority-ethnic background, and organizational skills to the party. While his Â£200,000 donation was generous, Reform UK received Â£2.8 million in donations last year, indicating they aren't solely reliant on his money. However, his heritage and ethnicity helped temper criticism of the party as racist, and his organizational abilities were credited with building much of the party's infrastructure, but his interpersonal skills were lacking, leading to internal friction.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling ordering former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 court decision ordering the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen in compensation. The focal point of the trial was whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable, but the presiding judge said the government's assessment did not provide a sufficient basis for the utility to swiftly conduct construction work.</p>

          <p>Opposition to a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales is growing among MPs, with at least a dozen who previously supported or abstained now likely to vote against it. The Assisted Dying Bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Some MPs who initially supported the bill now believe it crosses "red lines for protecting the vulnerable" and are concerned about potential coercion. These MPs have added their names to a growing list of colleagues who have suggested they will switch sides, citing concerns about safeguards and the potential for vulnerable individuals to feel pressured to end their lives.</p>

A preliminary analysis suggests that the laser system for measuring altitude malfunctioned, causing the lander to descend too rapidly, resulting in a hard landing.

          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has evolved from a close alliance to a bitter public feud. Musk, once a key advisor and major campaign donor, has recently criticized Trump's policies, leading to a public exchange of insults. The timeline includes Musk's endorsement of Trump, his role in the administration, and the eventual fallout over policy disagreements. The feud culminated in Trump threatening to cancel government contracts with Musk's companies and Musk claiming that Trump could not have won the election without him.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reiterated the need for the United States to reconsider its higher import duties during a meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa is in Washington for ongoing tariff talks at the ministerial level, aiming to pave the way for a meeting between the countries' leaders in mid-June. While Japan continues to demand the elimination of the higher tariffs, they are also considering accepting a cut in the rates, as the United States resists a full removal of the duties. The two sides discussed cooperation on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security.</p>

          <p>A US judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from enforcing a ban the president ordered barring Harvard University from accepting international students. The order by Judge Allison Burroughs, who is based in Massachusetts, said the oldest university in the US would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the proclamation went into effect. It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued that the ban is necessary on national security grounds, and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched a warship two weeks after it was damaged during an earlier launch attempt, an incident that drew harsh criticism from the country's leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer, which was restored to balance earlier this week, was launched on Thursday and is now moored at a pier, state-run news agency KCNA said. Kim, who witnessed the warship tipping over during the first launch attempt, criticised the incident as a "criminal act" that "severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride". At least four officials including Ri Hyong-son, the deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, have been arrested over the incident.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially stated that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to threats from President Trump to cancel government contracts, but later reversed his decision after a user on X urged him to reconsider. The shift occurred amidst an escalating dispute between Musk and Trump following Musk's criticism of the Republican tax bill. Musk's initial tweet responded to Trump's statement about potentially terminating Musk's governmental subsidies and contracts. The Dragon spacecraft is crucial for transporting crew to and from the International Space Station, and Musk's change of heart followed advice to "cool off and take a step back."</p>

Biden has refuted these allegations, calling them a "mere distraction," and the Justice Department's legal counsel have endorsed autopens as lawful for signing bills.

          <p>Lululemon shares have experienced a significant drop of over 20% after the company lowered its annual profit forecast, citing the impact of Trump's tariffs and concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. The company attributed lower store traffic in the Americas to economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and reduced consumer confidence. In response, Lululemon plans to implement strategic price increases on a small portion of its products and negotiate with vendors. Clothing and footwear brands, heavily reliant on manufacturing in Asian countries, are among the businesses most affected by the tariffs, leading to potential price increases for consumers.

          <p>A growing trend towards consuming food products with fewer ingredients is emerging, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). More retailers and food brands are offering items with simpler ingredient lists, influenced by the increasing awareness of UPF highlighted by Dr. Chris Van Tulleken's book. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on ingredient count can be misleading, as it may lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients. This debate underscores the complexities of navigating food choices and the need for a balanced perspective on processed versus unprocessed foods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. In many states, the time kids spend in detention doesn't count toward their ultimate incarceration, adding months to their confinement. This policy stems from the juvenile justice system's focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment, but it can result in a lopsided application of fundamental rights. Policy experts argue that this practice creates disparities and allows kids to languish in detention without access to proper services or education.</p>
