          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock significant growth opportunities for the company, particularly in its streaming business. Disney finalized the acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu for an additional $438.7 million, resolving a long-standing dispute over valuation. Iger emphasizes the importance of bundling Hulu with Disney+ and ESPN+ to enhance user experience, reduce churn, and increase advertising opportunities. The integration of Hulu's content library with Disney's existing offerings is expected to strengthen Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy and drive long-term revenue and profits, while the theme park business is also a resilient category even in an uncertain economy.

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Fort Bragg after deploying National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests. The deployment, authorized under Title 10, aims to protect federal personnel and property, costing an estimated $134 million for up to two months. California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing the administration, arguing the deployment bypasses state authority and is unwarranted given the nature of the protests. Trump claims Los Angeles would be "burning to the ground" without federal intervention, while Newsom asserts there is no need for such force. The legal battle highlights the tension between federal and state powers in managing civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, stating it is necessary to protect ICE agents enforcing immigration law. He claimed that ICE agents are being attacked while deporting "illegal criminals," justifying the federal intervention. The deployment is estimated to cost $134 million, funded from the Defense Department's operations and maintenance accounts. This decision follows a clash between the Trump administration and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued over the deployment, arguing it is illegal and inflames the situation. Hegseth assured that troops are well-prepared and equipped to handle the situation, despite concerns raised about their readiness and housing conditions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that any protesters attending the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., commemorating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, would be met with "very heavy force." Despite security officials tracking approximately nine planned protests, Trump claimed he had not heard of any and characterized potential protesters as people who "hate our country." The parade, scheduled for Trump's 79th birthday, has already drawn criticism and controversy, and the President's remarks have further heightened tensions. The Secret Service anticipates the number of protesters will be significantly smaller than the number of attendees.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is set to pilot a generative AI assistant, "Green Dot Assist," powered by Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform, in 35 locations to streamline barista tasks and enhance service speed. The aim is to simplify operations and make jobs easier for baristas, potentially reducing order times to four minutes. The AI assistant will provide quick answers to barista questions, ranging from drink recipes to equipment troubleshooting, accessible via tablet. Future iterations may include automated IT ticketing and shift coverage suggestions, though accuracy is a key consideration, and the company's partnership with Microsoft includes a grounding engine to ensure information reliability. This initiative is part of Starbucks' broader strategy to improve efficiency and customer experience.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive international study involving nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way relationship between screen time and socioemotional well-being. The research indicates that increased screen time is associated with a higher risk of developing aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in children. Conversely, children with pre-existing emotional or social difficulties tend to spend more time on screens. The study emphasizes the importance of limiting recreational screen time for children and ensuring that it does not interfere with essential activities such as sleep and physical activity, encouraging children to develop emotional resilience through interaction with friends and family.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asserted that President Trump has the authority to deploy National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to protect ICE agents enforcing immigration law. Hegseth's statement came during testimony before a House subcommittee, amid ongoing protests in Los Angeles. He emphasized the importance of ICE's ability to conduct operations safely in any state, prompting concerns from Democratic lawmakers about the role of the military in domestic law enforcement.

          <p>The movie *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* series, initially struggles to capture the essence of the original films, but eventually finds its footing by expanding the *John Wick* universe. The story follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) as she seeks revenge for her father's murder, training to become an assassin. The film initially suffers from generic plot elements, but it succeeds when it delves into the bizarre and darkly cartoonish world that made the *John Wick* series so popular. The movie features inventive stunts and a sense of humor that pays homage to the action filmmaking of Buster Keaton and Looney Tunes.</p>

Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, stated his intention to "re-establish public confidence" in shots, but experts argue that his actions politicize science and disrupt the regulatory process. Concerns are growing that Kennedy might appoint members who share his anti-vaccine views, potentially leading to biased recommendations and decreased immunization rates.
