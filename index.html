          <p>This article details the process leading to Peter Mandelson's dismissal as UK ambassador to the US. It's understood that Prime Minister Keir Starmer personally questioned Mandelson about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during the vetting process. Despite Mandelson's assurances, newly revealed emails showing his continued support for Epstein after his 2008 conviction led to his sacking, creating a significant political crisis for the government. The incident has raised serious questions about the adequacy of the vetting procedures and the Prime Minister's judgment.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has overwhelmingly approved a nonbinding resolution that endorses a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The vote was 142 in favor, with 10 against, including the United States and Israel, who criticized the measure as a "gift to Hamas." The "New York Declaration" resolution calls for a phased plan to end the conflict, condemns attacks on civilians by both Hamas and Israel, and urges countries to recognize a Palestinian state. The vote comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen amid intensified Israeli military operations.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 people participated in a "Unite the Kingdom" rally in central London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson. The demonstration, which featured a video address from Elon Musk, was met by a counter-protest of about 5,000 anti-racism campaigners. The Metropolitan Police deployed over 1,000 officers to maintain a sterile area between the two groups, though some officers were reportedly assaulted with projectiles. Nine arrests were made as police intervened to prevent breaches of the cordons and clashes between the opposing demonstrators.</p>

          <p>California's state legislature has passed SB 53, a bill that mandates transparency from developers of powerful "frontier" artificial intelligence models. The legislation requires major AI companies to publish detailed safety and security reports, specifically addressing how they mitigate potential "catastrophic risks" like AI-enabled bioweapons or critical infrastructure cyberattacks. The bill, which now awaits the governor's signature, aims to establish public accountability and create a regulatory framework for the rapidly advancing technology before such disasters can occur. Proponents see it as a crucial step, while some industry groups argue it could stifle innovation with unnecessary compliance costs.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the leading Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, has stated he would order the NYPD to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he were to visit the city. Mamdani alleges that Netanyahu is a war criminal and intends to honor an International Criminal Court arrest warrant related to alleged war crimes in Gaza. This pledge has drawn significant attention, given New York's large Jewish population and the fact that the U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority. Legal experts suggest such an action would be a "practical impossibility" and could create conflict with the federal government.</p>

By embracing minimalism and breaking from routine, they saved money, discovered what truly matters to them, and deepened their sense of self.

          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges brought against 61 activists who protested the construction of an Atlanta police training center known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the Georgia Attorney General's office lacked the authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute. This decision effectively collapses the state's two-year legal effort to use a law designed for organized crime against a protest movement. While some lesser charges remain for a few defendants, the ruling is a major victory for the activists and a significant setback for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>A clinical professor of dermatology is advising consumers to focus on ingredients rather than brand names when choosing popular lip oil products. Some users, particularly women of color, have reported experiencing hyperpigmentation after using certain lip oils. The expert explains that the thin skin on lips is susceptible to sun damage, which can be magnified by oils that lack SPF protection, potentially leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Consumers are advised to seek products with broad-spectrum SPF and hydrating ingredients like squalane, while avoiding potential irritants such as fragrances and certain oleic acids.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that the United States will only impose major new sanctions on Russia if all other NATO member nations agree to do the same and completely stop purchasing Russian oil. In a message to allies, he criticized some members for continuing to buy Russian energy, arguing it weakens their collective bargaining power and shows a lack of commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. Trump also suggested NATO should impose tariffs of 50% to 100% on China for its role in buying Russian oil, claiming these combined actions would end the war quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

The article details Cox's public plea for peace and his private conversation with President Trump, who warned him about the dangers faced by political figures.

          <p>An animal shelter in Billings, Montana, has been temporarily closed after smoke from methamphetamine being incinerated by the FBI filled the building, sending 14 workers to the hospital. The FBI was using the shelter's incinerator, normally used for animal carcasses, to destroy two pounds of seized narcotics when the smoke was drawn back into the facility. The affected employees experienced symptoms like headaches and dizziness, and the shelter's 75 animals had to be relocated. The building is now being tested for contamination, and the incident has raised questions about the safety of destroying drugs in this manner.</p>

          <p>This article examines the largely unresolved questions surrounding the source of Jeffrey Epstein's immense wealth, which was estimated at nearly $600 million at the time of his death. His fortune appears to have been primarily generated from managing the finances of a few billionaire clients, including Les Wexner and Leon Black, from whom he collected hundreds of millions in fees. The article details how Epstein used this wealth to build a powerful network of politicians, celebrities, and business leaders, facilitating access and influence through lavish gifts. Despite his claims of being a pioneer in finance, the exact mechanisms of his wealth accumulation remain shrouded in mystery.</p>

These survivors describe the generational trauma caused by family separation and forced removal, seeing painful echoes of their experiences in the recent ICE raids.

          <p>Neil Hershman, a 30-year-old former asset manager, has successfully revitalized the frozen yogurt chain 16 Handles after purchasing the company in 2022.

Since his takeover, the chain has seen a surge in customer demand, with same-store sales increasing by over 10% and systemwide sales reaching $20.6 million in 2024.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the paradoxical state of the modern dictionary business, which is facing financial collapse despite a golden age for the study of language. The rise of free online resources, search engine algorithms that favor licensed or AI-generated definitions, and a general distrust of traditional authorities have decimated the industry. The piece chronicles the struggles of Merriam-Webster and the recent sale and subsequent gutting of Dictionary.com's lexicography team. With fewer than a quarter of the professional lexicographers working today compared to two decades ago, the author argues that the need for expert-led dictionaries to chronicle and explain our language has never been greater.</p>
