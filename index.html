          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is moving north along the U.S. East Coast as a Category 2 storm. While it is not projected to make landfall, its large size is generating life-threatening surf and rip currents, prompting mandatory evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Officials have issued tropical storm and storm surge warnings for the region, urging residents to take immediate precautions and stay out of the ocean. The storm's effects are expected to be felt from Florida to New England throughout the week.</p>

          <p>Chris Brain, a 68-year-old former priest who led an influential evangelical movement in Sheffield during the 1980s and 90s, has been found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women. The prosecution stated that Brain abused women who were part of a so-called "homebase team" tasked with looking after him and his family. The jury at Inner London Crown Court convicted him of the charges but found him not guilty on 15 other counts. Deliberations are ongoing for four additional counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault.</p>

Concurrently, the company announced its acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion to strengthen its business with home professionals. Despite the positive results, executives noted that demand for larger home projects remains soft due to high mortgage rates and anticipate a market pickup when rates fall. The company has revised its full-year sales outlook upward to reflect its recent acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The viral "RushTok" trend on social media is shedding light on the intense and expensive nature of sorority recruitment at U.S. colleges. Some families are reportedly spending up to $10,000 on designer wardrobes, coaches, and stylists to help their daughters secure a bid, on top of potential annual dues exceeding $15,000. Psychologists suggest this high level of parental involvement can stem from parents trying to live vicariously through their children or overcompensating for their own past experiences. Critics argue the process can be punishing and detrimental to the mental health of young women.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley has filed a legal claim against the city, alleging that Mayor Karen Bass orchestrated a smear campaign to oust her. Crowley claims the mayor defamed her to shift blame for the city's handling of the catastrophic Palisades Fire and concealed how budget cuts undermined public safety. The claim asserts that Bass scapegoated Crowley amid criticism of the mayor's absence during the fire and falsely accused her of failing to provide information.

          <h2>Poll Finds Record Low Percentage of U.S. Adults Report Drinking Alcohol</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults say they consume alcoholic beverages, the lowest figure recorded in nearly 90 years of the survey. This decline corresponds with a significant shift in public perception, as a record-high 53% of adults now believe that even moderate drinking is detrimental to their health. The change in attitude is most pronounced among young adults, but older Americans are also increasingly viewing alcohol as a health risk. This trend reflects a growing awareness of the links between alcohol consumption and negative health outcomes like cancer.</p>

          <h2>Explainer Details How Potential Interest Rate Cuts Could Affect HELOC Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 10:37:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the potential impact of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts on homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). Because HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the prime rate, a Fed rate cut usually leads to lower monthly payments. However, the timing of this relief can vary based on the lender's adjustment schedule, the loan's billing cycle, and specific features like introductory rates or interest rate floors. Experts advise borrowers to review their loan terms and budget for potential rate fluctuations in either direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the brutal sexual assault and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata sparked a nationwide women's safety movement, progress appears limited. While the state government implemented new safety measures for women on night shifts, activists claim they have been only partially enforced and that significant gaps remain. The sole suspect was convicted and sentenced to life, but the victim's family has raised concerns about the investigation and alleged police harassment during recent memorial rallies. The article notes that the "Reclaim the Night" movement has lost momentum, and fresh concerns about safety have emerged.</p>

          <p>This article from BBC Verify examines President Donald Trump's recent claims that he has ended six or seven wars during his second term. The analysis reviews several conflicts where Trump has asserted credit for brokering peace, including those between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. While Trump's diplomatic interventions have been acknowledged in some cases, the report notes that some of the peace deals are fragile, some ceasefires have been violated, and in certain instances, like Serbia and Kosovo, there was no active war to end.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has tempered expectations for an imminent summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite recent encouragement from U.S. President Donald Trump. Russian officials stated that any such meeting would need to be prepared gradually, suggesting it is not an immediate priority. This comes as Trump, after a series of meetings with European leaders, acknowledged that Putin may not be interested in making a peace deal. Meanwhile, European allies are reportedly working on plans for a "reassurance force" to guarantee Ukraine's security if a peace agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a new directive for immigration officials to investigate the social media and other activities of applicants for benefits like green cards and work permits for any "anti-American" views. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), espousing such views could be considered an "overwhelmingly negative factor" leading to the denial of an application. The policy expands the grounds for discretionary denials and is part of a broader effort to tighten legal immigration by increasing vetting and scrutiny. Critics have called the new guidance highly subjective.</p>

          <p>French authorities are questioning a man on suspicion of murder after four bodies were discovered in the River Seine in a southeastern suburb of Paris. The investigation began after a passer-by spotted the first victim, a 40-year-old local man, near a bridge on August 13. A subsequent police search of the area uncovered three additional bodies in an advanced state of decomposition. Prosecutors have confirmed that one victim was strangled and another showed signs of violent injuries, but have not yet established a link between the deceased.</p>
