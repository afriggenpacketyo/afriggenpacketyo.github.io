          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited Israel and expressed doubts about whether military actions can solve the conflict in Gaza, advocating for a political solution instead. Wadephul emphasized Germany's commitment to Israel's security but noted that there is still room for criticism among friends, which must not lead to antisemitism. He also addressed the need for a political solution for the reconstruction of Gaza without Hamas and reiterated Germany's priority in returning the hostages home. Wadephul's visit aimed to strike a balance between Germany's commitment to Israel and adherence to international humanitarian law.</p>

          <p>Billy Evans, the partner of Elizabeth Holmes, has reportedly raised millions of dollars for a new blood-testing company named Haemanthus, which bears striking similarities to Theranos, the company that led to Holmes's conviction for fraud. Evans's company claims to be able to make diagnoses from blood, urine, and saliva samples, similar to the false claims made by Theranos. While some investors have passed on the pitch, Evans has reportedly raised almost $20 million from friends and other investors, with Holmes allegedly advising him. Investors should be extremely wary, as this venture mirrors the deceptive practices of Theranos.</p>
