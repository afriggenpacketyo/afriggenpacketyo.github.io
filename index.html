            <p>Former Congresswoman Barbara Lee is projected to become Oakland's next mayor, surpassing former City Councilmember Loren Taylor in the vote count. Oakland utilizes ranked-choice elections, which can extend the vote tally process. Lee's victory follows the recall of Sheng Thao, who faced criticism over Oakland's financial challenges and an FBI investigation into alleged corruption. Lee aims to unite the divided city and address issues like crime, homelessness, and government transparency, drawing on her extensive experience in Congress and her roots in activism.</p>

This can affect public spending, household finances, and business lending rates, potentially impacting economic growth. President Trump's decision to pause higher tariffs on most countries except China followed these market fluctuations, highlighting the sensitivity of economic policy to bond market reactions.

            <p>A prolonged bin strike in Birmingham, England, has highlighted the disparity between wealthy and impoverished areas of the city. While wealthier areas have experienced fewer disruptions, densely populated, low-income neighborhoods have been overwhelmed with uncollected waste. The strike, which began over pay cuts and downgrading of workers, has led to health concerns and accusations of a two-tiered waste collection system. Efforts to resolve the strike are ongoing, but the situation has underscored existing inequalities in the city.</p>

            <p>The ACLU is warning that immigration authorities are moving to deport Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act, despite a Supreme Court ruling requiring due process. The ACLU filed an emergency injunction to halt the deportations, arguing that migrants are not being given adequate notice or opportunity to challenge their removal. The government claims it is complying with the Supreme Court's ruling, but the ACLU alleges that the notices provided to migrants are insufficient. Federal judges have blocked deportations in several districts, highlighting the legal battle over the use of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

Trump has publicly criticized Powell's performance and the Fed's interest rate policies. However, it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire Powell, and even if he did, it may not significantly alter the central bank's decisions on interest rates, which are determined by the Federal Open Market Committee. Kevin Warsh is being considered as a potential replacement for Powell.</p>
