          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect in a deadly ambush on firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Roley allegedly lured first responders to a wildfire he started before opening fire, killing two and critically injuring a third. Investigators believe the act was intentional but have not yet determined a motive, finding no connection to extremist ideologies despite social media rumors. The suspect, who was found dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, had previously expressed a desire to be a firefighter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. renewable energy industry is facing a potential tax increase of up to $7 billion under the latest version of the Republican domestic spending bill. The proposed legislation introduces a new tax on wind and solar projects that source components from China and also accelerates the phase-out of key investment and production tax credits after 2027. Industry trade groups warn these measures could jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs and derail approximately $450 billion in planned infrastructure investments. The changes threaten to significantly alter the financial viability of future clean energy projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to the Republican-led domestic spending package, threatening to support primary challengers against GOP members who vote for it. The billionaire, who previously backed President Trump, criticized the bill for its massive increase to the national debt and its cuts to green energy tax credits. In a series of posts on his social media platform, Musk called on lawmakers who campaigned on fiscal responsibility to "hang their head in shame." His renewed attacks signal a potential rift with the Republican establishment over the party's fiscal direction.</p>

          <p>The comprehensive Republican domestic policy bill is moving closer to a final Senate vote, but it faces notable opposition from within the GOP. Senators like Rand Paul and Thom Tillis have criticized the legislation, with Tillis calling its deep cuts to Medicaid a "betrayal" of promises made to voters. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, offset by significant reductions in social welfare programs. Procedural rulings from the Senate parliamentarian have already stripped or modified several key provisions, complicating the bill's path and its projected cost savings.</p>

The move aligns with the company's "zero distance" philosophy to be closer to American consumers and its design teams.

The case, which drew intense national media attention, was solved after a seven-week manhunt, culminating in Kohberger's arrest.

The ACLU argued that the law was intended only for major military conflicts, not for addressing gang activity.

The dispute stemmed from a proposed 2019 television series that was never produced. Emmett stated he made the personal decision to settle the debt, which was tied to a defunct former company, because it was "the right thing to do."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Recent U.S. Tariffs Have Not Yet Led to Major Price Inflation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet caused a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices. Economists point to several short-term factors buffering the impact, including companies "front-loading" inventory by stocking up on goods before the tariffs took effect. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial cost increases or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. While inflation remains muted for now, experts caution that these are temporary measures and that price increases are likely to materialize later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Shortly after starting, the jury sent a note to the judge expressing concerns about one juror's ability to follow legal instructions, prompting the judge to remind the panel of their obligations. Over seven weeks, prosecutors presented evidence alleging Combs used violence, fear, and his influential status to run a criminal enterprise involving coerced sexual encounters. The defense argued the acts were consensual and the case is about money.</p>

          <p>Stanford University has announced a $140 million budget cut for the upcoming academic year, a move the administration attributes to "consequences from federal policy changes." In a letter to staff, university leaders cited reductions in federal research funding and the potential impact of a new, higher tax on university endowments as key factors. The cuts are expected to result in staff layoffs, though the university plans to continue hiring faculty at a slower pace. Stanford, which has one of the nation's largest endowments, will increase its endowment disbursement to protect financial aid.</p>

          <p>The annual Fourth of July celebrations may be impacted by U.S. trade policy, as tariffs on Chinese imports are affecting the fireworks industry. With over 95% of U.S. fireworks sourced from China, a 30% tariff has created supply chain disruptions and is expected to lead to higher prices and reduced selection for consumers. According to industry representatives, many importers paused shipments when facing the threat of even higher tariffs earlier in the year, resulting in a potential shortage during the busiest sales week. Major vendors expect price increases on a significant portion of their products.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's recent comments drawing a moral equivalence between the actions of the United States and those of China are a form of "embarrassing equivocation." The author critiques Trump for suggesting "we do that to them" when asked about China's intellectual property theft and other hostile acts, comparing it to a similar defense of Vladimir Putin in 2017. The piece contends that this rhetoric is not a considered moral position but a lazy, nihilistic approach that undermines America's standing as a global leader and its heritage of liberty.</p>
