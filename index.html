          <p>England captain Harry Kane admitted that his team "got away with it" in their narrow 1-0 victory against Andorra, acknowledging that their performance was "not good enough." Kane scored the lone goal in the match held in Barcelona, but the team faced boos from their own fans due to their lackluster play. Kane cited fatigue and a lack of quality as factors contributing to their struggles, adding that they need to analyze and learn from the experience, especially considering similar conditions expected in future tournaments. England remains at the top of Group K in the World Cup qualifiers, but Kane emphasized the need for improvement in all aspects of their game.</p>

          <p>Unmarked graves containing the remains of 14 individuals executed during Greece's civil war era (1946-1953) were discovered in a park near Thessaloniki. These prisoners, believed to be communists and sympathizers, were held at the nearby Yedi Kule fortress, where they were allegedly tortured before their execution. The discovery was made during a municipal park renovation, with the bodies found jumbled and hastily buried, unlike a previous discovery of neatly aligned remains. Relatives of the executed are requesting DNA tests to identify the bodies, and efforts to find other mass graves will continue to provide proper honors to the deceased.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests that erupted over immigration enforcement operations, which led to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump signed a memorandum to address the "lawlessness" in California, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and stating that it would "only escalate tensions." The protests began after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations resulted in arrests across the city.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other politicians have condemned the attempted assassination of Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, who sustained three gunshot wounds, including one to the head. Rubio attributed the attack to "violent leftist rhetoric" originating from the Colombian government and called on President Petro to de-escalate inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials. Authorities are investigating the shooting, which was allegedly carried out by a 15-year-old hit man, and have offered a substantial reward for information related to the incident. President Petro has ordered an investigation and canceled a planned trip to France due to the seriousness of the events.</p>

          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow reflects on the shifting mood in the United States regarding pluralism and racial justice, noting a decline in support for Juneteenth and an increase in efforts to erase Black history. He highlights instances such as the removal of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C., and the skittishness of corporate sponsors to support Juneteenth-related activities. Blow argues that America's youngest national holiday is now caught in the crossfire of the country's culture wars, leading to the cancellation of Juneteenth celebrations in multiple cities. He characterizes this phenomenon as "The Great Blackout," pointing to actions like an executive order condemning the direction of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>

          <p>Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, declared that the country would prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg, Liam Cunningham, and other activists from reaching the Gaza Strip, citing the need to maintain its naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms. Katz labeled Thunberg and her fellow activists as "Hamas propagandists" and instructed the IDF to intercept the flotilla. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition accused Israel of jamming their communication as they approached Gaza, while Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament, said she expected to be illegally detained. This comes as the Israeli military is accused of firing on Palestinians near aid distribution points, resulting in multiple deaths.</p>

          <p>A member of Britain's armed forces has been arrested in Kenya, with U.K. military police investigating an accusation of sexual assault. The U.K.-Kenya defense cooperation agreement allows thousands of British soldiers to train in Kenya each year, with approximately 200 U.K. troops permanently based there to train Kenyan soldiers. The arrest has renewed concerns about the behavior of British soldiers in the area, particularly in light of past incidents such as the 2012 death of Agnes Wanjiru, who was last seen with British troops. The British Army has launched an inquiry into allegations of unacceptable behavior by U.K. personnel in Kenya.</p>

          <p>New photographs of China's two sixth-generation fighter jets, the Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, have provided more clues about their potential cruising capacity and ability to work with combat drones, according to defense experts. The latest image of the larger J-36 fighter reveals its three weapons bays and the dorsal intake for the third engine, which is likely intended to provide additional thrust for supersonic speeds. Experts suggest the third engine indicates the aircraft's capability for cruising at supersonic speeds, enhancing its overall performance and mission capabilities.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for conflict in relationships, with tone of voice or attitude topping the list due to signaling contempt. Family relations often lead to arguments stemming from misalignments and unmet needs, while household chores become a source of tension due to the uneven distribution of labor and the "invisible load." Communication styles also contribute to conflicts, with ineffective engagement or hostility exacerbating initial issues. The article offers strategies for navigating these conflicts, such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, redistributing tasks, and using the "five-second rule" to prevent escalation.</p>

Supporters gathered at a town hall meeting to defend creative expression and access to information, with Hayden expressing concern about diminishing opportunities for the public to access knowledge freely.

Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, disapproving of the program and emphasizing the need for due process.

China formally presented its blueprint for cooperation in 2002 through an agreement with Asean, but its expansive claims are contested by several member states.
