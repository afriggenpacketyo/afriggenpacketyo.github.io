          <p>An 88-year-old jewelry store owner in San Jose, California, was hospitalized after a violent smash-and-grab robbery. Surveillance footage captured an SUV crashing into the storefront, followed by over a dozen suspects rushing in to loot the display cases. During the heist, one suspect pushed the elderly owner to the ground, and another was seen pointing a gun at an employee. The owner's family reported he suffered a stroke and injuries from broken glass but has since been released from the hospital in stable condition.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon commented that the U.S. economy is showing signs of weakening, although it remains uncertain if a recession is imminent. His statement followed a significant downward revision by the Labor Department, which found that 911,000 fewer jobs were created through March 2025 than initially estimated. Dimon noted that while consumer spending remains, confidence may be declining, and various factors are creating a mixed economic picture. He also suggested the Federal Reserve will likely reduce its benchmark interest rate soon. (not investment advice)</p>

Consumers took to social media to describe symptoms like "agonising weeping spots" and chemical burns. The company attributed the issue to a change in the manufacturing process for a raw material, affecting batches sold in the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. Mitchum stated it has resolved the problem and is removing the affected products from store shelves.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile, a massive $5 billion project expected to double the nation's electricity capacity. The dam is celebrated within Ethiopia as a transformative economic achievement, but it has fueled significant regional tensions, particularly with Egypt. Egypt, which relies on the Nile for 97% of its water, views the dam as an existential threat that could restrict its water flow. Despite years of diplomatic disputes and failed mediation attempts, Ethiopia completed the project, which it self-funded.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned recent Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, calling them a violation of sovereignty that risks regional escalation. The statement came ahead of his scheduled meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Downing Street. Starmer emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, and increased aid to Gaza as the only path to peace. Meanwhile, some UK parliamentarians are calling for Herzog to be denied entry, citing allegations of war crimes against Israel.</p>

The lawsuit highlighted how the teenager discussed his mental health struggles and suicide plans with the chatbot. While some experts commend the move, they also caution that the effectiveness of such safeguards on rapidly evolving AI technology is still unknown.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants, continuing its retreat from a broader brand overhaul. This decision follows the company's recent move to revert to its old logo after a new design was met with intense customer backlash, contributing to a significant drop in its stock value. In a statement, the company acknowledged that the planned modernizations did not align with what customers love about the brand. The chain had only remodeled four of its 660 locations before halting the initiative.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possessing CS gas following a partial evacuation of London's Heathrow Airport. Hundreds of people were forced to leave Terminal 4 for three hours after a canister of what is believed to be CS spray was discovered. About 20 people were treated by paramedics for minor irritation caused by the substance. The Metropolitan Police have stated that the incident is not being treated as terrorism-related, and an investigation is ongoing to determine the circumstances.</p>

          <p>A columnist discusses the pervasive nature of vaccine misinformation, prompted by reader responses claiming his own COVID-19 infection proved vaccines are ineffective. He contrasts this public skepticism with scientific consensus, noting that vaccines are designed to reduce severity and save lives, not completely prevent infection. The article criticizes the anti-vaccine stance of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arguing his administration has dismantled expertise and fueled public confusion. An infectious disease expert quoted in the article confirms that vaccines have successfully transformed COVID from a deadly disease into a more manageable one.</p>

          <p>A 238-page scrapbook compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003 has been released by a U.S. House committee, revealing contributions from numerous high-profile figures. The book includes a sexually suggestive note and drawing allegedly signed by Donald Trump, a message attributed to former President Bill Clinton, and a letter from UK Ambassador Peter Mandelson calling Epstein his "best pal." The contents, often flattering and sexualized, offer a glimpse into the elite social circles surrounding the convicted sex offender years before his crimes became widely known.</p>

          <p>A new European Commission report warns that the post-war, rules-based global order is eroding, making a return to the previous status quo unlikely. The report highlights geopolitical turmoil and increasing weaponization of supply chains, trade, and information as key threats. It calls for the European Union to achieve greater autonomy by reducing its dependence on the U.S. for digital and financial services and on China for critical raw materials. This assessment underscores the growing security and economic risks faced by the EU in a shifting global landscape.</p>

Sotomayor declined to comment on the specifics of a recent dissent she wrote regarding racial profiling in immigration sweeps, as the case is still pending.

          <p>Following the release of revised jobs data indicating a weaker labor market, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the Federal Reserve may now implement three interest rate cuts this year. He identified Home Depot as the stock in his charitable trust's portfolio with the "most upside" in this economic environment. Cramer believes the home improvement retailer is well-positioned to benefit from anticipated rate cuts and falling lumber prices. He advised investors to view the current weakness in lumber costs as a buying opportunity for the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

His itinerary includes an awards ceremony for WellChild and meetings related to youth violence prevention. However, his visit is dominated by speculation over whether he will meet with his estranged father, King Charles III, or his brother, Prince William. Royal experts suggest a meeting with the King is possible but note that relations with Prince William remain non-existent, making a reunion between the brothers highly unlikely.</p>
