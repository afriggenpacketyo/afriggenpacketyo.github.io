          <p>Anthony Coulson, the general manager at the McVitie's factory where chocolate digestives have been made for a century, suggests that people have been eating them wrong. He believes the chocolate-covered side should face down, allowing the chocolate to melt and enhance the flavor. Despite his suggestion, Coulson admits to eating them chocolate-side up himself, acknowledging that people can enjoy them however they prefer. The chocolate digestive was launched about a quarter of a century after the plain variety.</p>

Such a concession would also undermine hopes for reunification of families separated by the 2014 occupation.
