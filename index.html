          <p>A massive power outage plunged parts of Spain, Portugal, and southern France into darkness, disrupting daily life for tens of millions. The cause remains unclear, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stating that a blackout of this scale is unprecedented. Power has been partially restored in some areas, including major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, thanks to assistance from France and Morocco, but full restoration remains uncertain. The blackout led to significant disruptions in travel, including subway suspensions, train strandings, and flight delays. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed the "Take It Down Act," a bipartisan bill aimed at combating the spread of sexually explicit imagery online without consent, including deepfakes. Supported by First Lady Melania Trump, the legislation requires social media companies to remove such content within 48 hours of a victim's request. While proponents hope the bill will prevent cyber abuse and suicides stemming from shame, digital rights groups caution that it could suppress lawful speech and lacks protections against malicious takedown requests.

This data will improve climate change models and deforestation tracking, providing consistent, comparable views of forests from year to year.

          <p>Mexico and the United States have reached an agreement regarding water sharing from the Rio Grande basin, following threats of tariffs and sanctions from President Trump. Mexico will immediately transfer water from international reservoirs to Texas farmers and increase the U.S. share of the flow in its tributaries. Both countries affirmed the 1944 treaty regulating water sharing and agreed it does not need renegotiation. Mexico faces a high risk of not meeting the treaty deadline in October.

Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes suggested that Paramount is scrutinizing content, including stories about the Trump administration, due to its desire to secure FCC approval for a merger with Skydance Media. This follows President Trump's criticism of CBS and a lawsuit against CBS and Paramount. The FCC, led by Trump ally Brendan Carr, is also conducting an inquiry into CBS' campaign coverage.
