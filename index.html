          <p>The Trump administration is reorganizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership due to White House dissatisfaction with the agency's arrest and deportation figures. Kenneth Genalo, the former head of Enforcement and Removal Operations, is retiring, while Robert Hammer, who led ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, has been reassigned. They will be replaced by Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, both career ICE officials, as the administration aims to increase arrests to a minimum of 3,000 per day. The changes reflect the administration's focus on arresting and deporting unauthorized migrants, and officials want to vastly increase arrests. </p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing a craniotomy following his IBF minimumweight title match. Shigeoka lost a split decision to Filipino champion Pedro Taduran and suffered a right subdural hematoma, leading to the surgery. Due to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will have to retire from the sport because boxers who have had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license. His gym has received many messages of support from around the country, and Shigeoka is currently recovering in the hospital.</p>

          <p>France is set to ban smoking in numerous outdoor public spaces starting July 1, including beaches, parks, gardens, bus stops, and areas near schools. Violators could face fines up to $153, with enforcement primarily handled by regular police and public self-regulation. The ban excludes outdoor cafÃ© seating areas, preserving the French tradition of enjoying a cigarette with coffee. This move expands existing anti-smoking laws, aiming to reduce tobacco-related illnesses, which cause over 75,000 deaths annually in France, and the government hopes to continue to see declines in daily smoking.</p>

The court's decision allows the tariffs to be used while the case is litigated, with the next hearing scheduled for June 5.</p>
