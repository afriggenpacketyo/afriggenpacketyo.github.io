          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced plans to tighten regulation in crowded manufacturing sectors, specifically targeting electric vehicles and solar power. The goal is to address what it calls excessive internal competition and phase out outdated production capacity by enforcing higher standards. This move is part of a broader national strategy to stabilize key industries and promote high-tech consumer goods to stimulate domestic demand amid economic pressures.</p>

          <p>World Rugby's chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has dismissed complaints from Australia's coach, Joe Schmidt, regarding a controversial clearout during the second Test against the British and Irish Lions. Schmidt argued the decision not to penalize the play, which preceded a match-winning try for the Lions, contradicted player welfare standards. Gilpin defended the on-field officials, stating they made the call under immense pressure and that the organization stands by their decision-making process while acknowledging the complexity of rugby's laws.</p>

          <p>Economic experts suggest the United Kingdom could be an unexpected beneficiary of the new trade agreement between the European Union and the United States. The EU faces a 15% tariff rate on its goods, while the UK has secured a lower 10% levy, making British exports to the U.S. relatively cheaper. This could incentivize American firms to source goods from Britain over the EU and may even encourage some EU manufacturers to shift operations to the UK to maintain competitiveness.

The capital's outlying districts of Miyun and Yanqing were hit particularly hard, with some areas receiving over 21 inches of precipitation. The storms have forced the relocation of over 80,000 people, destroyed roads, and knocked out power and communications in numerous villages.
