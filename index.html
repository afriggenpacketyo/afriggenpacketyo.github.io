          <p>Hurricane Erick is rapidly intensifying in the Eastern Pacific and is projected to reach major hurricane status before impacting southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center has issued hurricane warnings and watches for the coast, anticipating devastating wind damage and life-threatening flooding and mudslides. Erick is expected to produce significant rainfall, with totals reaching up to 20 inches in some areas, and dangerous storm surge along the coast. This event comes after Acapulco was previously devastated by Hurricane Otis in October 2023, heightening concerns for the region's preparedness and resilience. The storm's intensification and potential impacts underscore the need for residents to rush preparations to protect life and property, as the hurricane poses a significant threat to the region.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations has rejected President Trump's demands for unconditional surrender and claims of seeking negotiations. The mission denounced Trump's threats against Iran's Supreme Leader as cowardly, asserting that Iran will not negotiate under duress. Iran vows to respond to any threat with a counter-threat and any action with reciprocal measures, maintaining a firm stance against external pressure. This statement reflects the heightened animosity between Iran and the U.S., further complicating efforts to de-escalate the regional conflict and resolve the ongoing disputes.</p>

          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that foreign criminals should expect deportation, arguing that human rights law should not impede such actions. Speaking at the Council of Europe, Mahmood emphasized the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but called for its evolution to address modern threats. She highlighted instances where foreign criminals used Article 8 of the ECHR to avoid deportation, deeming it out of step with common sense. The government plans new legislation to clarify the application of Article 8 in immigration cases, ensuring Parliament's control over borders and addressing public concerns about the misuse of human rights protections.</p>

The court stated that Tennessee's ban on treatments like puberty blockers for under-18s reflects an ongoing debate among medical experts about the risks and benefits. Dissenting justices argued the law is unconstitutional and endangers young people, leading to medical discrimination based on sex.</p>

The New York Times' editorial board has also urged voters to exclude Mamdani from their ranked-choice ballots, highlighting the establishment's resistance to fresh, progressive ideas.

          <p>A new study in Nature warns that global food production is at risk due to climate change, with significant declines expected in major crop-growing regions. Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, six key staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century, even with adaptation efforts. The largest drops are projected in highly productive farmlands, such as the US Midwest, which are crucial for global food exports. This decline could lead to higher food prices and increased food insecurity, especially as the global population continues to grow.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law banning certain gender-affirming care treatments for minors, ruling 6-3, with Chief Justice John Roberts authoring the opinion. The court found the law did not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, leaving policy decisions to elected representatives. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing the decision invites discrimination and harms transgender children and their families. This ruling marks a significant decision on LGBTQ rights and has sparked widespread debate.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he has not yet decided whether the U.S. military should join Israel's attacks on Iran, but suggested a deal with Iran is still possible. He mentioned that Iran sought talks and proposed sending a delegation to the White House, but he emphasized the situation has changed significantly since Israel began its strikes. Iran's mission to the UN responded, denying they asked to "grovel at the gates of the White House," and warned against any U.S. intervention, which they say would risk "all-out war."</p>

It challenges the assumption that men don't gossip, citing a study that men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates, but women gossip neutrally more often. The article suggests men's lack of gossip skills stems from fewer cultural opportunities to chat freely and a fear of appearing "messy." It also links the inability to gossip to the male loneliness epidemic, highlighting the importance of sharing stories for building intimacy.</p>
