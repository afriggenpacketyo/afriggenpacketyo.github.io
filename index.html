          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 16:44:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly stated that the performance of Irish rap group Kneecap at Glastonbury Festival is "not appropriate" due to a recent terror charge against one of its members, Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, who is accused of displaying support for Hezbollah. This follows similar sentiments expressed by Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, who suggested the BBC should not broadcast their performance. A BBC spokesperson responded by saying that while they do not ban artists, their programming will adhere to editorial guidelines. The group has previously clashed with Badenoch, winning a discrimination case against the UK government after she attempted to block their funding. The band member in question was released on bail and will be back in court on August 20. The comments from the Prime Minister are unlikely to deter the group and may even boost their profile. </p>

          <p>Severe weather swept across the upper Midwest, resulting in at least three deaths in Enderlin, North Dakota, due to a tornado. The storm system also brought large hail and strong wind gusts, causing widespread damage and power outages. In northern Minnesota, particularly in Beltrami County, wind gusts exceeded 100 mph, leading to flash flooding in Bemidji and extensive property damage, including roofs torn off buildings and numerous fallen trees. Itasca State Park in Minnesota also experienced significant damage and closures due to the wind event. Clean-up efforts are underway amidst dangerous heat conditions affecting nearly 150 million Americans in the Midwest and Northern Plains. </p>

The FBI also made progress on high-profile cases, including the COVID-19 cover-up, the Dobbs leak, and the DNC pipe bomb investigation, apprehending three of the FBIâ€™s top ten "most wanted." Bongino stated that numerous personnel changes were made to the FBI's leadership and the agency reorganized its structure to prevent past mistakes from being repeated. The FBI also coordinated with federal partners to apprehend, imprison, and deport thousands of illegal immigrants and made over 700 anti-ICE riot arrests. Bongino affirmed the FBI's commitment to protecting the Homeland and pursuing those involved in rioting and public corruption. </p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison after five years, along with 13 other political prisoners, and reunited with his wife in Lithuania. Tikhanovskaya announced her husband's release with a video of their reunion, expressing her joy. The release coincided with a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg and a meeting with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky, an activist who challenged Lukashenko in the 2020 elections, was jailed for 18 years in 2021 on charges of rallying mass protests. His release is seen as a significant diplomatic breakthrough for Lukashenko, potentially easing his isolation from Western politicians, although it does not signal an end to political repression in Belarus. </p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of its chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens.

The FDA warns that individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities could experience severe allergic reactions if they consume the affected products. No illnesses have been reported, but the company is working with the FDA to ensure product safety.
