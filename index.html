          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker expressed concern over national security following the use of Signal by Trump administration members to discuss sensitive foreign policy.  He sent a letter to the acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, requesting assurances about steps to protect service members' safety and classified information.  Pritzker stated his loss of faith in Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's ability to maintain national defense integrity, citing the Signal incident as evidence of carelessness.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, appearing on Newsmax, predicted a long-term boom in the stock market due to reinvestment in the United States as a result of President Trump's tariffs.  He acknowledged a transition period but emphasized the positive impacts on American workers and small businesses.  Vance cited lower egg and energy prices and trillions of dollars in new investment as evidence of improving economic conditions.
