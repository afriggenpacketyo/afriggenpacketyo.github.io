Thousands gathered, necessitating riot police intervention to prevent access to the hotel. Ireland's Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan condemned the unacceptable violence, promising a forceful police response and emphasizing that those involved would face justice.

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil alleges the Trump administration is attempting to re-detain and deport him using immigration court as a "kangaroo court" due to his advocacy. Khalil, a green card holder, was previously held for over 100 days despite his lawful residency, a detention he links to protesting genocide. Federal courts have blocked his removal, with judges questioning government jurisdiction and finding constitutional rights violations against pro-Palestinian protesters. Khalil remains confident in his federal court vindication, while a State Department official asserts the administration's commitment to removing national security threats.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded $230 million from the Department of Justice as compensation for its criminal investigations into him, dating back to before his first term. These administrative claims relate to probes into alleged 2016 election interference and the 2022 Mar-a-Lago classified documents search. Trump stated he would donate any money received to charity, while his legal team characterized the investigations as "Democrat-led Witch Hunts." The DOJ declined to comment on the claims, but a spokesman affirmed that department officials adhere to ethics guidance regarding potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Construction of President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom has begun, sparking ethical concerns regarding its funding. Trump claims he will personally pay a significant portion, with some anonymous donors also contributing. Legal experts, like Richard Painter, view this as an "ethics nightmare" potentially enabling "pay-to-play" access. A dinner for potential donors included executives from major companies, and YouTube is the only revealed donor, contributing $22 million. The White House maintains the project is privately funded, will not cost taxpayers, and will serve future administrations, despite the transparency issues.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General Kris Mayes has filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Mike Johnson, demanding the immediate swearing-in of Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva. Grijalva, who won a special election in September, is crucial as her signature would reach the threshold for a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein files. Speaker Johnson dismissed the lawsuit as "patently absurd," citing scheduling issues and House precedent for the delay. However, Grijalva and her supporters argue that the delay disenfranchises her constituents and obstructs legislative action on a significant public interest issue.</p>

Acknowledging his privileged position, Hunter Biden expressed profound gratitude for the pardon, which he feels was the right decision from his father's perspective.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and tariff threats, analysts suggest President Donald Trump's firm control over his administration could act as a "guard rail" in US-China relations. His direct leader-to-leader diplomacy with Xi Jinping, coupled with an apparent restraint from antagonizing Beijing on red-line issues like Taiwan, is seen as a potential stabilizing factor. Experts note that Trump's decisive leadership means he "calls the shots," potentially tempering more hawkish elements within his team. This dynamic suggests that personal chemistry and direct engagement between the two leaders might increasingly shape the trajectory of bilateral ties, offering a unique approach to managing competition.</p>

Russia insists on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from eastern regions and addressing the "root causes of the conflict." This fundamental disagreement dashed hopes for a summit, with European diplomats suggesting Russia's demands were too high for a viable deal.</p>

With maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, the storm is expected to bring heavy rains, potentially up to 10 inches, to Haiti and the Dominican Republic through Friday, posing a risk of significant flash flooding and landslides. A hurricane watch is issued for Haiti's southern coast, and a tropical storm watch for Jamaica. While unlikely to impact the mainland U.S., there is "significant uncertainty" in its path and intensity, with some models showing it stalling near Haiti and Jamaica as a Category 1 hurricane.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial that he never witnessed drug use from his late teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019. The lawsuit, brought by Skaggs' family, alleges the Angels are responsible for former communications director Eric Kay supplying the fentanyl-laced pill that caused his death. Trout acknowledged seeing Kay act "wired" and suspecting drug use from him, but was unaware of Skaggs' or other players' opioid use. The trial seeks $118 million from the Angels, who contend Skaggs' actions were his own, while MLB has since implemented opioid testing and treatment referrals.</p>

          <p>A small contingent of British planning officers has been dispatched to Israel to join a US-led multinational taskforce, the civil military coordination centre, tasked with monitoring the Gaza ceasefire. The taskforce, which may include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE, aims to oversee the ceasefire agreement and coordinate humanitarian assistance, though British troops will not enter Gaza. This deployment follows an American request for UK participation, leveraging Britain's experience in security force capacity-building. The move comes as the ceasefire, part of a Trump-brokered peace plan, faces challenges and renewed violence, with calls for Hamas's disarmament still unresolved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the growing concern of software obsolescence in modern, software-dependent cars, likening them to smartphones. While over-the-air updates introduce new features, older vehicles risk becoming incompatible with advanced software, especially with the rapid integration of AI and autonomous functionalities. Unlike traditional mechanical cars that can be restored, software-driven vehicles may experience diminished functionality as their operating systems age, potentially affecting essential features like navigation or entertainment apps. This highlights a fundamental mismatch between the long lifespan of automobiles and the much shorter technological update cycles, posing a significant challenge for long-term usability and manufacturer support.</p>

While incremental steps like prisoner exchanges and aid increases have occurred, the long-term viability of Trump's peace plan, particularly Hamas's disarmament, remains uncertain. Vance affirmed no American troops would be deployed in Gaza, emphasizing coordination.

Only 40% reported having quality jobs, with common complaints including unpredictable work schedules (62%) and financial struggles (one-third). The survey also highlighted concerns about technology's impact, particularly AI, and a lack of employee input on these issues.
