          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers are finding financial security elusive despite increases in their net worth. Experts suggest that young people today face structural challenges, such as rising costs for housing, healthcare, and retirement, making it harder to achieve traditional markers of success compared to previous generations. The article highlights the concept of living "at break even," where unexpected expenses can easily lead to financial instability, and notes that young adults are adapting by living with parents longer and finding new ways to build community. The article points to the difficulties of saving for markers of the American Dream for young people today.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dramatically cutting prescription drug costs for American consumers by matching the lowest global prices. He criticized the current system, describing it as a "redistribution" that allows drugmakers to exploit US patients. The policy, dubbed ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù, would force pharmaceutical companies to match the lowest global prices, effectively ending what Trump describes as systematic overcharging. The order is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could limit access to vital care, but health policy experts largely support the plan, while doubting the proposal will withstand the fresh legal challenges likely to arise.</p>

          <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is expected to resume in the coming days, following its suspension. Plans may involve reducing the number of venues and scheduling more doubleheaders. The league's resumption would alleviate scheduling concerns and is driven by its value as a lucrative sports tournament. This development occurs after a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir and subsequent military actions between India and Pakistan, with a recent ceasefire brokered by the US.</p>

The cooling of U.S.-China trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, which relies on Chinese production and sales.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. will launch its direct-to-consumer streaming service, named Fox One, before the NFL season begins. The service will be priced in line with wholesale pricing, and cable TV subscribers will get access at no additional cost. Fox plans to offer the app as part of bundles with other distributors and services, aiming to avoid losing traditional cable subscribers. The announcement followed Fox's report of a 27% increase in fiscal third-quarter revenue, boosted by the Super Bowl.</p>

          <p>The royal family of Qatar is donating a jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane, with the aircraft set to be donated to the future Trump presidential library. The 747-8 needs to be checked for security before it can serve as Air Force One. Trump defended the donation, citing the age of the current Air Force One, while Democrats have urged an investigation into the ethics of accepting the gift.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities and counties to ban homeless encampments and released a model ordinance for local governments to adopt. Newsom also announced $3.3 billion in funding from Proposition 1 for communities to expand behavioral health housing and treatment options. This action aims to address the lack of progress at the local level, framing homelessness as a humanitarian crisis and a health and safety issue, while emphasizing the need for supportive housing and shelter beds.</p>
