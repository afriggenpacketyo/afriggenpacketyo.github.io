          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the murder and sexual assault of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, a case that remained unsolved for nearly 60 years. The conviction, believed to be the UK's oldest solved cold case, was made possible by re-examining DNA evidence from the original 1967 investigation. Police linked semen from the crime scene to Headley, a previously convicted criminal, whose palm print also matched one found at the victim's home. Headley, who was in his 30s at the time of the crime, is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday for both offenses.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have announced a major recall of approximately 143,416 pounds of ready-to-eat bologna products from Gaiser's European Style Provisions Inc. The recall was issued due to misbranding, as the products contain undeclared meat or poultry ingredients, such as pork in veal bologna or beef in chicken bologna. The affected items were produced between March and June 2025 and distributed nationwide under various brand names. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has urged consumers to either throw away the products or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu has announced it is making its Ernie generative AI large language model open source, a significant move in the global AI race. This decision marks a shift for Baidu, which previously advocated for proprietary models, and is seen as a response to the success of open-source competitors like DeepSeek. Experts believe this will increase competition, putting pressure on closed-source providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to lower costs and improve performance. While some analysts note potential security and trust issues associated with a Chinese-developed model, the move is expected to accelerate AI development by making powerful tools more accessible globally.</p>

The proposed legislation includes a tax on wind and solar projects that use components from China and accelerates the phase-out of key tax credits for projects placed in service after 2027. This change compresses project timelines and introduces execution risk, leading analysts to describe it as a challenging outcome for the sector.

          <p>The Trump administration has formally notified Harvard University that it violated federal civil rights law through its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students. A joint task force from several government departments concluded that the university's environment enabled antisemitism to fester, putting it in "violent violation" of the Civil Rights Act. The administration has warned Harvard that it must implement immediate changes to its policies and campus culture.

Republicans are pushing to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, using the budget reconciliation process to bypass the need for Democratic support.

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a second spell of unusually high temperatures for June, with forecasts predicting highs of 34°C, an event climate scientists attribute to a 'heat dome' intensified by climate change. Analysis shows that temperatures exceeding 35°C have become five times more common in the last decade compared to the latter half of the 20th century. While the immediate cause is a persistent high-pressure system, scientists affirm that the 1.36°C of human-caused global warming has inevitably amplified the heat. Experts warn that the UK's infrastructure is poorly prepared for such heat, which poses significant health risks.</p>

In the first quarter of 2025, Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones, reflecting a broader European effort to build defense autonomy and avoid cybersecurity risks associated with Chinese technology. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain free of Chinese influence, aiming to provide key components like motors and chips.

These lower court decisions had found that state-level restrictions were unconstitutional.

Firefighters recovered multiple bodies from the rubble, and two of the approximately 30 hospitalized workers later died from their injuries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his condolences and announced financial compensation for the families of the victims, as authorities continue to investigate the cause of the common, yet tragic, industrial accident.</p>

The event would mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and an invitation would represent a significant diplomatic gesture. While the Chinese foreign ministry has not confirmed the report, which originated from Kyodo News, President Trump himself recently mentioned that a trip to China could happen "at a certain point."

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a popular seafront cafe in western Gaza has killed at least 20 Palestinians and wounded dozens more, according to eyewitnesses and medics. The outdoor venue, Al-Baqa Cafeteria, was a well-known gathering spot for journalists, activists, and local residents seeking internet access. Rescue teams are continuing to search through a large crater left by the explosion. The attack occurred amid a new wave of Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip and increasing international pressure for a ceasefire, following the collapse of a previous two-month truce in March.</p>

This review sets up a high-stakes legal battle that could significantly alter the flow of money in politics ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

An FTO designation would criminalize material support for the group and allow victims' families to sue for compensation.

The survey projects Brent crude will average $67.86 per barrel, though this rally is expected to be limited by rising OPEC+ supply and a cautious global demand outlook. Analysts believe that unless the Iran-Israel conflict escalates significantly, increasing production from OPEC+ and comfortable inventory levels will temper price spikes.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's (ECB) target for the first time this cycle. The figure, down from 2.1% in May, was lower than the 2.2% anticipated by analysts and provides positive news for the euro zone's largest economy. This development adds to evidence that inflation in the region is stabilizing, which could support one final interest rate cut by the ECB in September. However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain potential risks to the disinflationary trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Germany to Cut Development Aid Budget to Prioritize Increased Defense Spending</h2>

          <p>Germany's draft budget for 2025 includes significant cuts to its development and humanitarian aid, reducing the ministry's funding by nearly €1 billion from the previous year. This move is part of a broader shift to increase military spending to meet the newly agreed-upon NATO target of 5% of GDP for defense. The cuts have drawn sharp criticism from non-governmental organizations, who warn of devastating consequences for the world's most vulnerable populations, especially as other donor countries are also reducing their contributions. The German government, however, has described the cuts as "appropriate" within its coalition agreement.</p>

          <h2>Key Witness in Federal Human Smuggling Case Against Kilmar Ábrego García to Be Spared Deportation</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed not to deport a key cooperating witness in the federal human smuggling case against Kilmar Ábrego García. The witness, José Ramón Hernández Reyes, who has past criminal convictions, has reportedly been released early from prison in exchange for his testimony. Prosecutors identify Hernández Reyes as the owner of the vehicle Ábrego García was allegedly using when he was arrested in 2022. The case gained national attention when Ábrego García was mistakenly deported to El Salvador before being returned to the U.S. to face the charges, which his lawyers call "preposterous."</p>
