          <p>Police in the UK have indicated that the Home Office was notified last week about the potential for banning Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The decision, driven by safety concerns and previous violent incidents, has drawn criticism from political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called the move "wrong." The government is now in urgent talks to find a solution and potentially overturn the ban, emphasizing that additional resources may be required to ensure the match can proceed safely for all attendees.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has given Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, a seat on the prestigious Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government spending. Lowe, who was expelled from Reform UK after a dispute with party leadership, stated he is delighted with the appointment and intends to rigorously scrutinize public sector spending. This move is part of a broader Conservative strategy to work cross-party with individuals who align with their values, similar to appointments made for MPs from Labour and the DUP on other committees.</p>

          <p>HBO has announced that actors Danielle Deadwyler, Natasha Lyonne, and Eli Roth are among the new cast members joining the third season of its acclaimed series "Euphoria." The Emmy-winning show is scheduled to return in the spring of 2026 after a nearly four-year hiatus, with production already underway for its eight-episode run. The upcoming season will reportedly feature a time jump, moving the main characters beyond their high school years, and will see the return of key cast members like Zendaya and Sydney Sweeney.</p>

This incident marks the sixth such attack against suspected drug smugglers as part of a broader U.S. campaign to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The operation has involved a significant military buildup, including warships and B-52 bombers, and has drawn condemnation from Venezuela, which describes the actions as a policy of aggression and harassment.</p>

          <p>President Trump is moving forward with a $250 million, privately financed ballroom at the White House, an effort to cement his architectural legacy that has drawn criticism from Democrats. A recent dinner for major donors, including executives from Nvidia, OpenAI, and Apple, highlighted the project's financial backing, which is being managed by the Trust for the National Mall. In response, Democrats are introducing bills to regulate such projects and have launched a preliminary investigation into the ballroom's financing, questioning potential influence from donors and the source of the funds.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions, the economies of the United States and China remain deeply intertwined, with experts suggesting a complete decoupling would harm the U.S. more significantly. China has retaliated against U.S. tariffs with its own measures, such as restricting rare-earth mineral exports and halting soybean purchases, while also successfully redirecting its exports to other global markets. Although China has been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, significant mutual dependence in sectors like aerospace and semiconductors persists, highlighting the complex relationship.

          <p>With gold and silver prices reaching new records, the article offers guidance on how to invest in these precious metals safely. It advises investors to understand the different risks associated with various investment types, such as physical bullion versus mining stocks, and suggests splitting funds between both metals to diversify. Crucially, it reiterates the conventional wisdom of limiting total precious metal holdings to a maximum of 10% of one's overall portfolio to maintain balance and ensure they function as a hedge.

          <p>Deutsche Bank has identified DuPont as a short-term "catalyst buy," anticipating that the upcoming spinoff of its Qnity Electronics division on November 1 will unlock significant shareholder value. Analysts believe the company currently trades at a substantial discount to the sum of its parts and that both the new Qnity shares and the remaining DuPont stock will be attractive holdings. The CNBC Investing Club noted it plans to hold both stocks post-spinoff, with a particular long-term interest in Qnity due to its stronger growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The op-ed contends that as the minority party, they have a weak negotiating position and are unlikely to win, while public blame for the shutdown may shift toward them. The author suggests the party is guided by unpopular ideologies on issues like immigration and gender, rather than rational political calculation, and would be better served by returning to a more centrist message.</p>
