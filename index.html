          <h2>Trump Administration Resumes Student Loan Collections for Millions in Default</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a five-year pause, the Trump administration is restarting federal student loan collections, impacting millions of borrowers, though the forgiveness provision has been eliminated from some repayment plans. The move coincides with staff terminations at the Education Department, leading to long wait times for borrowers seeking assistance. Experts warn this resumption amid system uncertainty could exacerbate economic challenges for working families. Borrowers in default may experience significant credit score declines, potentially increasing borrowing costs for other loans. Optimism score is 40.</p>

          <p>Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has promised reforms and investments as centrist parties formally signed a coalition agreement.

          <p>Hollywood studio stocks, including Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery, experienced a decline after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.
