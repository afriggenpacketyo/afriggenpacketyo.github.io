          <p>With President Trump suggesting Alcatraz's reopening, this article revisits some of its notorious former inmates. Al Capone, the infamous gangster, was transferred to Alcatraz after allegations of preferential treatment in another prison; he spent his final year there in a hospital after contracting syphilis. George "Machine Gun" Kelly, known for his kidnapping crimes, also resided at Alcatraz, earning his nickname through his wife's encouragement of his criminal activities. The article also mentions Robert Stroud, the "Birdman of Alcatraz," and Alvin "Creepy" Karpis, a member of the Barker/Karpis gang involved in high-profile kidnappings. This piece provides a historical overview of some of Alcatraz's most well-known figures.</p>

          <p>China and the United States are engaging in trade talks for the first time since trade war tensions resurfaced. Analysts predict possible outcomes ranging from a temporary pause in import duties to a complete breakdown, which could damage markets and trade. Jayant Menon suggests China might secure a suspension of duties similar to that offered to other nations, creating a window for negotiations. Since January, the US has significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports, while China has responded with its own duties on US products.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating an alleged attack on a prison officer by Axel Rudakubana, who was convicted of murdering three young girls in Southport. Rudakubana allegedly threw boiling water over the officer, who was hospitalized as a precaution. The incident raises concerns about prison officer safety, especially after a similar attack by the Manchester Arena bomber. Prison violence has reached a decade-high, prompting the Justice Secretary to consider tasers and body armor for prison officers. Rudakubana was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years for the murders and other offenses.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping has been strategically positioning China to dominate global supplies and make the world dependent on its exports and know-how, a plan intensified since 2020. China has ramped up exports, directed significant lending to industrial borrowers, and introduced economic warfare tactics like export controls. This approach has allowed China to retaliate against tariffs by restricting critical mineral exports, impacting industries worldwide. However, this strategy is worsening relations with trading partners and impacting Chinese households, as it prioritizes state-owned enterprises and political control over market-driven growth and consumer welfare.</p>

Experts estimate the re-entry will occur around May 10th, with a landing site somewhere between 52 degrees north and south latitude.

          <p>A teenage amateur footballer, Cerys Vaughan, who was initially banned by the Football Association for remarks made to a transgender woman opponent, is now demanding an apology. Vaughan was sanctioned for asking the rival player if they were a man, later raising fairness and safety concerns with the referee. An FA appeal board found the initial hearing "unfair", and the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan states the case has significantly impacted her life, and she feels the FA put her through unnecessary stress.</p>

The white paper is expected to include measures requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, especially in IT and telecommunications. Visa restrictions may be imposed on nationalities with higher rates of overstaying and asylum claims. Migrants may face longer waiting periods before applying for permanent residency, and tougher English language requirements are likely.
