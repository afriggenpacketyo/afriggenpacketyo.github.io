            <p>A police officer in Belle Isle, Florida, sustained minor injuries after his patrol car was struck by a vehicle driven by an undocumented immigrant. The driver, Paula Hernandez Lazaro, was cited for failing to yield and driving without a license, and was later found to be in the United States illegally. This was her second citation for driving without a license. The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the incident and has the authority to handle suspected illegal immigrants. The police department expressed gratitude for the community's support of the injured officer.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that 155 Chinese citizens are fighting for Russia in the ongoing conflict, a claim Beijing denies. Zelensky stated that his government has gathered passport data and surnames of these individuals, alleging they receive training in Moscow before deployment. He also released a video purportedly showing captured Chinese soldiers, one of whom claimed it was his first time in combat. Zelensky has called this a deliberate expansion of the war and urged the US and the world for a response, while China maintains a neutral stance, saying it is not selling lethal arms to Russia.</p>

            <p>Robert Reid, the FIA's deputy president for sport, has resigned due to what he describes as a breakdown in governance standards within the organization. Reid cited decisions being made behind closed doors and a steady erosion of principles. His resignation follows changes to FIA statutes that have been criticized as concentrating power and reducing accountability, as well as an open letter from MotorsportUK chairman David Richards accusing the FIA of a "shift of moral compass". The FIA is also facing a lawsuit from Susie Wolff, director of the F1 Academy.</p>

            <p>Federal budget cuts have forced the closure of vaccination clinics across the United States, disrupting immunization efforts amid a measles resurgence and growing vaccine hesitancy. The CDC abruptly canceled $11.4 billion in COVID-related funds for state and local health departments, leading to the cancellation of planned clinics and outreach programs. Public health officials express concern over the accessibility of vaccines for vulnerable populations and the potential for preventable harm. The cuts also impact efforts to address other preventable diseases, such as the flu and mpox.</p>

            <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day tariff reprieve on most countries, excluding China, reversing a sharp sell-off in bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield decreased by over 10 basis points to 4.288%, and the 2-year Treasury yield also dropped. Investors were relieved by the tariff pause, which involves bringing the rate down to a universal 10% tariff during that time. Strong demand for 10-year Treasurys at the debt auction on Wednesday also eased investors' concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

The National Immigration Agency (NIA) faced criticism for enforcing a policy requiring mainland-born spouses to provide documentation proving they have abandoned their mainland nationality, or risk losing their Taiwan residence permits. The policy, based on a 2004 revision to immigration law, has been criticized as potentially disrupting thousands of families.</p>

            <p>Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, suggests that U.S. President Donald Trump should negotiate a "win-win" trade deal with China, following Trump's temporary pullback on reciprocal tariffs. Dalio believes this pause is a better approach to addressing trade imbalances and hopes Trump will negotiate a deal that appreciates the RMB against the dollar. He also suggests cutting the U.S. deficit to 3% of the nation's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Prime Minister Starmer is expected to announce plans for dedicated police teams focused on patrolling town centers at peak times in England and Wales. The Labour government aims to end the policing "postcode lottery" by ensuring every community has specialist neighborhood officers. The plan includes placing named local officers in each neighborhood and increasing police ranks by 13,000 by 2029. Starmer will argue that visible policing has declined, leading to increased unsolved crimes and anti-social behavior.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's social media post urging investors to "BUY!!!" coincided with a market surge following his announcement of a 90-day tariff pause. The S&P 500 gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days. Trump's own company, Trump Media, saw a significant increase in stock value, raising questions about potential insider trading and market manipulation.

            <p>England's Children's Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, believes that decisions regarding school phone bans should be left to head teachers rather than being imposed nationally by the government. Her survey indicates that most schools already limit phone use, but children are accumulating screen time at home. She emphasizes the role of parents in setting boundaries and the responsibility of technology companies in creating a safer online environment. While supporting head teachers' autonomy, she suggests further research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's phone use.</p>

The arrival of Jay Rodriguez and Sam Smith, along with the presence of Steven Fletcher and Jack Marriott, has created intense competition for spots on the team. Manager Phil Parkinson's past ruthlessness with players suggests that sentiment will not factor into team selection.</p>
