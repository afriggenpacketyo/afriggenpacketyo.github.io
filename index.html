          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its key borrowing rate, despite uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and their impact on the slowing economy.  While officials still project rate cuts later in the year, the uncertain economic outlook and the potential impact of tariffs have increased ambiguity.  The Fed's decision reflects a cautious approach to navigating the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration continues to heavily criticize federal judges for blocking its agenda, even after Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked Republican calls for impeachment.  The White House press secretary stated that judges are acting erroneously and as partisan activists, undermining the will of the president and the American public.  This defiance of court orders has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis.</p>

          <p>The firing of two Democratic FTC commissioners by President Trump has raised concerns about market stability.  The former commissioner warned that the ouster could erode the FTC's ability to police markets and protect honest businesses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady has implications for various consumer borrowing costs. While mortgage rates are falling due to economic uncertainty, credit card rates have also eased slightly. Auto loan rates remain elevated due to rising car prices and tariffs, while federal student loan rates remain fixed.  Consumers struggling with high prices and borrowing costs may see some limited relief.</p>

          <h2>Trump Tariffs Impact Auto Suppliers More Severely Than Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-19 13:51:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada are expected to disproportionately affect auto suppliers due to lower USMCA compliance rates for parts compared to vehicles.  The lack of profitability in the supply chain makes it difficult to absorb these increased costs, potentially leading to production disruptions and impacting the broader auto industry.  Companies are lobbying for tariff exemptions for USMCA-compliant products.</p>
