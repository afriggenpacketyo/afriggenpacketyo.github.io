          <p>A new report from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicates that the trust fund which supports retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033, unchanged from last year's projections; at that point, only 77% of scheduled benefits will be payable. The combined trust funds, including the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, can cover benefits and administrative costs until 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated. The Disability Insurance fund is expected to fully cover benefits through at least 2099, according to the report, which also takes into account the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners. However, the report did not include potential impacts from new tax proposals, tariffs, and deportations, which could pose risks to Social Security's financing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Philadelphia Phillies player John Kruk revealed during a Phillies TV broadcast that he once threatened to kill MLB umpire Brian O‚ÄôNora during a game near the end of his career. The incident occurred in 1995 when Kruk, playing for the Chicago White Sox, became frustrated with a strikeout call by O‚ÄôNora in the top of the ninth inning. Kruk admitted his frustrations boiled over due to a slump at the plate, leading to the heated exchange with the umpire who was in his third year at the time. Kruk spent six seasons with the Phillies, achieving a .309/.400/.461 slash line with 62 home runs.</p>

Some students participating in programs like Birthright Onward have been moved from Tel Aviv to safer locations, with parents exploring alternative routes for their children to leave the country. The U.S. Embassy in Israel initially announced it was arranging evacuation flights and cruise ships, but the State Department later clarified that it had no official announcement on assisting private citizens with departure plans at this time.

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors have charged 19 individuals in a conspiracy orchestrated by the Mexican Mafia to murder rapper Swifty Blue, real name Nelson Abrego. According to the complaint, Manuel ‚ÄúSnuffy‚Äù Quintero, an alleged member of the Mexican Mafia, issued the order to kill Abrego in 2022. The conspiracy involved communications through TikTok messages and recorded jail calls, with participants including prisoners from Kern County, jail inmates in downtown Los Angeles, and gang members in Paramount. The attempted assault on Abrego occurred in November 2023 when inmates beat and stabbed him in his jail cell, though he survived the attack.</p>

          <p>Many Californians struggle with high transportation costs, making car ownership unattainable for some, as illustrated by Franchescoli Andrade's daily commute involving biking, train, and bus. Andrade's 20-mile journey from South Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley takes 90 minutes each way, a burden he faces since he can no longer afford to fix his car. A study by United Way indicates that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs, including transportation, with the average cost of owning a new car exceeding $12,000 per year. While moving to more affordable areas might seem like a solution, it is often impractical due to family and community ties.</p>

          <p>A New Yorker known as "Streeter" has made over six figures by reporting idling vehicles through New York City's Citizens Air Complaint Program. This program allows citizens to report trucks and non-city buses that idle for more than three minutes, with reporters receiving 25% of the fines, which typically range from $350 to $600. The law, initiated by George Pakenham, aims to address air pollution, with New York City having made just under $70 million from the program. While some truck drivers view the program as a "bounty hunter" scheme, Pakenham maintains that it is a crucial public health measure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully hatched ten condor chicks, contributing to the restoration of the state's depleted condor population. These chicks will enhance the genetic diversity of the wild condor population, with four being raised under a double-brooding method. All chicks bred at the zoo are eligible for release into the wild as part of the California Condor Recovery Program. When the program began four decades ago, there were only 22 California condors left on Earth; as of 2024, there are 561 condors, with 344 living in the wild.</p>

The bear was first spotted on a trail camera as a cub in 2023 with the lid around its neck. Despite the uncomfortable accessory, the 110-pound bear survived and was able to feed itself, although its neck was scarred and missing hair. The bear was anesthetized, and the lid was cut off, allowing it to return to the wild.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading climate scientists warn that the Earth may breach the 1.5C warming limit in as little as three years due to current carbon dioxide emissions levels. A recent assessment indicates that the remaining "carbon budget" has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes, which, at current emission rates, will be exhausted in approximately three years. This could lead to a breach of the Paris Agreement target, although the planet may not exceed 1.5C of warming until a few years later. The current rate of warming is about 0.27C per decade, with the rate of extra heat accumulating in the Earth's climate system more than doubling since the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to debates, and aim to ensure that diverse views can be discussed and taught.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK due to their limited benefits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded that funding these drugs would not be a good use of taxpayers' money and could lead to cuts in other essential services. The drugs, which slow the progression of Alzheimer's, potentially delaying the transition from mild to moderate dementia by four to six months, have a high annual cost per patient, estimated between ¬£20,000-¬£25,000 in the US. Pharmaceutical companies plan to appeal the decision.</p>

The initiative aims to prevent the spread of these parasites, which can cause significant damage to livestock, pets, and wildlife.
