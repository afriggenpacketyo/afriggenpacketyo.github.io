        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands is showcasing a nearly 200-year-old condom decorated with erotic art as part of an exhibition on 19th-century sex work. The condom, believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, features an image of a nun and clergymen and the phrase "This is my choice" in French, referencing a Renoir painting. The museum acquired the condom at auction to highlight the lighter and darker sides of sexual health in an era marked by fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis. The exhibit aims to address the underrepresentation of 19th-century sexuality and prostitution in the museum's collection and was scheduled to remain on display until the end of November. The museum hopes this exhibit will help people learn about the history of sexual health and safety. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History preparing a planetarium show stumbled upon a surprising revelation about the Oort Cloud, a distant region filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. While fine-tuning a scene for "Encounters in the Milky Way," they noticed a spiral shape within the inner section of the Oort Cloud, resembling a bar with two waving arms. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, suggesting a more complex structure influenced by the movements of celestial objects. The researchers published their findings in The Astrophysical Journal, noting the difficulty in confirming the spiral shape through observations but emphasizing its significance in understanding the outer solar system.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a £15 billion investment plan for transport projects across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country in England. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This move marks a departure from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The investment aims to address regional disparities and boost growth in areas that have faced economic challenges. This funding aims to improve transportation infrastructure across the country. </p>

Carsley's future was uncertain during his interim role as head coach for the senior England team, but he has now dedicated himself to the FA for another two years. He faces challenges with player availability due to club commitments and injuries, but remains focused on preparing the team and improving their performance from the previous tournament.</p>

          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa announced a major restructuring plan aimed at addressing the struggling automaker's declining sales and challenges in the electric vehicle market. The plan includes slashing 11,000 jobs and closing seven plants as part of efforts to return the company to a solid financial footing. These challenges have been further exacerbated by President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

The Fairness Act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for those receiving income from public pensions not subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The agency expects to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November, crediting automation for expediting payments.

Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said the optical fibre network was theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this kind of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. The research team acknowledged that the transmission rate is still too low to handle images.</p>

The Congressional Integrity Project (CIP) condemns the hearing as “political theater” and an exercise in hypocrisy, given the substantial federal funding received by Republican allies and rightwing groups. Witnesses include Mark Krikorian, Daniel Turner, and Scott Walter, described as having extremist views and conflicts of interest.

It delves into the history of ultrahigh-IQ societies, noting their infighting and lack of worldly accomplishments, and suggests that intelligence alone does not necessarily yield sublime works.

          <p>Documentary filmmakers are praising HBO Documentary Films for its director-driven approach and freedom given to filmmakers. Directors such as Alex Gibney, Matt Wolf, and Nanette Burstein appreciate the creative autonomy and support they receive from HBO. Unlike some streaming services that rely on algorithms, HBO allows filmmakers to craft nuanced and profound stories. The company is known for balancing compulsive watchability with a touch of class. </p>

          <p>This article analyzes Janelle James' chances of winning an Emmy for her role as Ava Coleman in 'Abbott Elementary.' Despite previous nominations, she has not yet won, facing competition from co-star Sheryl Lee Ralph and performances in 'The Bear.' James has received other awards, including Screen Actors Guild and NAACP Image awards, and a WGA nomination for her writing on 'History of the World: Part ll.' The article draws a parallel to Kelsey Grammer, who won on his fourth attempt for 'Frasier,' suggesting this could be James' year.</p>

          <p>James Young, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent, faces new charges of assault with a firearm and other weapons-related offenses, adding to previous charges of stockpiling illegal weapons and domestic violence.

Despite objections from prosecutors, a judge allowed Young to remain free while awaiting trial, subject to electronic monitoring.

          <p>An executive order aimed at strengthening law enforcement by increasing the provision of military equipment and tactics to local police departments raises concerns about the erosion of the civilian character of policing. The author argues that extending military tools and tactics to civilian policing blurs the line between the roles of police and military, which are designed for fundamentally different purposes. This militarization of police, fueled by U.S. foreign policy efforts, can lead to the adoption of tools and strategies of war, turning American citizens into targets. The author contends that this approach promises more of the same, leading to continued erosion of the civilian character of policing.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that over 90% of popular freshwater fish in Southern California are infected with human-infecting parasites, specifically trematodes. These parasites, historically found in Southeast Asia, can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, and lethargy in humans who consume infected fish. The parasites were likely introduced to the U.S. by the Malaysian trumpet snail, which is now widespread in California's freshwater sources. To prevent illness, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends thoroughly cooking freshwater fish or freezing it before consumption to kill any potential parasites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have identified a neural mechanism that explains how experiences translate into emotions. After a positive or negative event, a lingering signal persists in the brain, creating a broader emotional state. This "sustain" signal, unlike brief reflexive responses, allows experiences to merge and interact, shaping emotional reactions. The discovery could offer insights into emotional differences seen in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia. The team's research suggests that sustained signals in the brain play a role in altering a person or animal's brain state.</p>

The SALT deduction, capped at $10,000 under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), has led many states to enact pass-through entity (PTE) level taxes to bypass the federal limit for pass-through business owners. The House-approved bill would block specified service trade or businesses (SSTBs) from using the SALT deduction workaround. The changes could substantially impact white-collar professionals.
