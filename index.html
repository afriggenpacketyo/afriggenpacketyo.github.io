          <p>A significant wildfire in New Jersey has consumed over 13,000 acres and is only 50% contained, prompting air quality alerts in New York City and Long Island due to shifting winds carrying smoke. The Jones Road Fire in Ocean County is expected to expand due to dry conditions, winds, and low humidity, according to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. While not expected to be as intense as the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke, it still poses risks for sensitive groups. Firefighters are working to contain the blaze, and winds are predicted to shift again, potentially bringing more smoke to the region.</p>

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who disguised herself as a man named Raymond Lloyd to gain entry into the male-only Magic Circle in 1991, has finally been granted membership after being expelled when her deception was revealed. Lloyd, with the help of fellow magician Jenny Winstanley, successfully fooled examiners but was ousted when the Magic Circle began admitting women. After a public search, the Magic Circle apologized and presented Lloyd with a membership certificate, honoring Winstanley's legacy. Today, the Magic Circle remains heavily male-dominated, with women comprising only 5% of its approximately 1,700 members.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Merck has revised its full-year profit forecast downward, citing an estimated $200 million impact from tariffs, primarily between the U.S. and China, and a charge related to a licensing agreement with Hengrui Pharma. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share between $8.82 and $8.97, slightly lower than the previous outlook. This adjustment does not factor in potential tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., which are prompting Merck to increase its U.S. manufacturing investments. Despite the profit outlook reduction, Merck reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast of $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion and reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by its oncology portfolio and animal health products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democrats are divided over how to respond to President Trump's deportation of undocumented immigrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador, specifically the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Some, like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, advocate for high-profile opposition to the deportations, while others worry that focusing on immigration will benefit Trump politically. The concern is that highlighting the rights of undocumented immigrants could alienate voters focused on economic issues. However, others argue that standing up for due process is a moral imperative and that the political costs are minimal if messaging remains disciplined and focuses on Trump's economic mismanagement.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has reduced its full-year earnings forecast, citing expected volatility and uncertainty related to global trade developments, which are projected to increase supply chain costs, coupled with subdued consumer conditions in many markets. The company's international sales partially offset weaker demand in North America. For the first quarter, PepsiCo reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.48, slightly below expectations, and revenue of $17.92 billion, surpassing estimates. The company now anticipates core constant currency earnings per share to be roughly unchanged from the prior year, a decrease from the previous projection of mid-single digit growth.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the widespread issue of soil contamination in Los Angeles, exacerbated by recent wildfires. Testing revealed varying levels of toxins, including lead, in soil around burn areas, but also highlighted that pre-existing pollution is common in urban soils. While scraping and hauling contaminated soil is an option, experts suggest in-place remediation methods like bioremediation are more sustainable. The article provides guidance on soil testing, interpreting results, and implementing strategies such as sheet mulching and phytoremediation to reduce toxins and create safer gardening environments.</p>

          <p>The Real ID deadline is approaching on May 7, and many Americans still need to obtain the new identification for domestic travel and entry into federal facilities. Despite multiple extensions, a significant portion of the population remains non-compliant, potentially leading to delays and additional screening at TSA checkpoints. The TSA will accept other forms of identification, such as U.S. passports and military IDs, for those without a Real ID. The Department of Motor Vehicles is offering extended hours at select locations to accommodate last-minute applicants, urging individuals to review the required documents and schedule appointments.</p>

          <p>The author argues that economic nostalgia, exemplified by both the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trump-era tariffs, results in detrimental policies. Both protectionist episodes emerged from a longing for a romanticized past, ignoring the realities of a changing world. Smoot-Hawley aimed to protect farmers but led to retaliatory tariffs and a collapse in global trade, while Trump's tariffs, intended to revive manufacturing, have hurt manufacturers and led to cronyism. The author concludes that embracing change and creative destruction is essential for prosperity, rather than attempting to freeze economies in place with trade barriers.</p>

Regional pricing is used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden, and if implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation. If implemented, it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland than households in the South.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the UK's increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, electricity bills are rising, prompting questions about why the shift to green power isn't translating into lower costs for consumers. Several factors contribute to this, including the time and expense of transitioning to a greener system, the allocation of costs, and the structure of the electricity market. The wholesale price of electricity, often set by the cost of gas, remains a significant component of bills, and the aging electricity grid requires costly upgrades to accommodate new renewable sources. Government initiatives and market adjustments are underway to address these issues and promote cheaper, cleaner energy.</p>
