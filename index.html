        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The scheme addresses unfair discretionary commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, which led to customers overpaying for loans on an estimated 14 million agreements. While previous estimates were higher, the regulator now suggests the average payout will be around £700 per person, with the total compensation from lenders potentially reaching £8.2 billion. This move aims to provide fair redress to consumers who were given inaccurate information or locked into unfair contracts.</p>

          <p>Virginia Senator Mark Warner is facing scrutiny over a significant campaign donation to attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who is now embroiled in controversy. Reports revealed that Jones had previously made violent and threatening comments about a Republican colleague, leading to widespread calls for him to withdraw from the race. Warner, who has publicly condemned political violence, described the remarks as "appalling" but has not yet called for Jones to exit or for the $25,000 donation to be returned. The situation highlights the growing pressure on Democratic leaders to distance themselves from the disgraced candidate.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price fell by 5% after a report raised concerns about the profitability of its cloud computing venture involving Nvidia's expensive AI chips. According to internal documents cited by The Information, Oracle's gross margins on its Nvidia cloud business were only 14%, a stark contrast to the company's overall margin of approximately 70%. This suggests that despite rapid growth in cloud contracts, the high cost of AI hardware and aggressive pricing strategies may pose significant challenges to Oracle's long-term financial performance in the competitive AI market.

          <p>Author Morgan Housel argues that financial wealth is not a prerequisite for happiness, which is more closely tied to contentment and managed expectations. In an article discussing his book, he outlines five rules for a happier life, emphasizing the importance of appreciating ordinary beauty and recognizing that psychological wealth comes from wanting less, not having more. Housel suggests that true satisfaction is achieved when one feels nothing is missing, regardless of their income or lifestyle. He posits that happiness is ultimately the gap between one's expectations and their actual circumstances, a state accessible to anyone.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to significantly increase protection for its struggling steel industry by doubling tariffs on foreign steel and reducing import quotas. This move is a direct response to the flood of cheaper imports, primarily from China, which produces steel on a scale that dwarfs the EU's output. The proposed measures, which would replace an expiring safeguard clause, aim to help the European steel sector become competitive again and invest in decarbonization. The plan mirrors similar protectionist actions taken by the United States and signals a hardening stance on global trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a challenge to Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors, a case that pits free speech rights against the state's authority to regulate professional conduct.

Conversely, the state of Colorado defends the ban as a necessary measure to protect minors from a practice widely deemed harmful and ineffective by major medical associations.

The decision is based on the increasing demand for energy and grid solutions driven by the rapid expansion of AI data centers, which require massive amounts of power. While acknowledging short-term weakness in the company's onshore wind business, the club views the core electrification and power generation segments as key growth drivers. This trade reflects a bullish outlook on the essential infrastructure needed to support the ongoing AI revolution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The attorney for a woman shot by federal agents in Chicago during an immigration enforcement operation has claimed that body-camera footage contradicts the official narrative. According to the defense, the footage captures an officer taunting 30-year-old Marimar Martinez, saying, "Do something, bitch," moments before opening fire. Federal prosecutors allege Martinez was part of a convoy that aggressively pursued and rammed a Customs and Border Protection vehicle. Martinez and another driver face charges of assaulting a federal officer, but a judge has ordered their release pending trial amid the disputed accounts of the incident.</p>

          <p>The Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) has announced it will formally appeal a decision by FIFA's Disciplinary Committee that accused it of "cheating." The allegations stem from a match against Vietnam where Malaysia fielded seven newly naturalized players who FIFA claims were ineligible to represent the country, allegedly due to forged documents showing Malaysian ancestry. FIFA has suspended the players and fined the FAM, calling the use of fraudulent documentation a serious breach of fairness. The FAM vehemently denies the allegations, stating the players acted in good faith and that the portrayal is inaccurate and unfair.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man from Birmingham has been found guilty of stalking television and radio presenter Myleene Klass over a four-year period. The man sent numerous unwanted and disturbing items to Klass at her central London radio studio, including a gun, handcuffs, a police uniform, and a will-writing kit. During the trial, Klass described the "sheer terror" she felt upon learning the extent of the stalking campaign, which she called a "huge violation."

          <p>In a landmark development, David Norris, one of the men convicted of the 1993 racist murder of British teenager Stephen Lawrence, has publicly admitted his involvement for the first time. During a parole hearing, Norris acknowledged he was part of the gang that attacked Lawrence but refused to identify the other killers, claiming he and his family would be at risk. Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, stated that Norris remains a danger to the public because he has not shown full contrition by naming his accomplices.

This alternative data provides a bleak picture of the labor market, suggesting a more pronounced slowdown than was previously understood.

          <p>The estate of Michael Bond and the producers of the Paddington films are taking legal action against the satirical puppet show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the UK's High Court, cites copyright and design right concerns over a sketch that depicts the beloved children's character as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears and discusses taking cocaine. This portrayal starkly contrasts with the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations of fans. The legal challenge aims to protect the integrity of the Paddington character from what the creators see as an unauthorized and damaging parody.</p>
