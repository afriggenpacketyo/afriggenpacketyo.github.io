          <p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr asserted that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel appeared to mislead the public about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, justifying regulatory scrutiny. Carr indicated that the media landscape is in a period of significant change influenced by the Trump administration and that these shifts are not yet complete. The chairman's actions and comments have sparked outrage from Democrats and former President Obama, who accuse him of abusing his power to suppress free speech and engaging in government coercion against media companies. The controversy underscores a deepening conflict over the First Amendment and media independence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The startup Beewise has developed an AI-driven, robotic beehive called the BeeHome to protect bee populations from threats like climate change and pesticides. Using cameras and AI software, the system monitors individual bees and autonomously provides food, medicine, and thermoregulation to maintain colony health. The technology aims to reduce the high rate of colony collapse, which affects about 40% of bee colonies annually and threatens global food supplies dependent on pollination. Beewise reports that its BeeHomes result in 70% lower colony loss and are already being used in thousands of locations, demonstrating a scalable solution to a critical environmental issue.</p>

          <p>During a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump suggested that the UK could deploy its military to halt illegal migration across the English Channel. Trump stated he had discussed the issue with Starmer, drawing parallels to his own border security policies in the United States and warning that such migration "destroys countries from within." The press conference concluded Trump's second state visit to the UK, which also included the announcement of a new technology deal focused on AI cooperation. The leaders presented a united front on migration while also addressing topics like Palestinian statehood and the war in Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Swedish study has revealed that a low dose of aspirin can reduce the recurrence of colorectal cancer by 55% in patients whose tumors have a PIK3CA gene mutation. The randomized trial followed over 3,500 patients, with one group receiving 160 milligrams of aspirin daily and the other a placebo for three years post-surgery. Researchers noted the effect was particularly strong in women and believe the findings are immediately relevant for clinical guidelines. As an inexpensive and widely available drug, aspirin could offer a significant and accessible treatment to prevent thousands of cancer recurrences globally each year if broadly implemented.</p>

          <p>Productivity software company Notion has reached over $500 million in annualized revenue, largely driven by the successful integration of artificial intelligence features. The company, which introduced its AI writing assistant just before the generative AI boom, now reports that over 50% of its customers are paying for AI add-ons. Notion recently launched a customizable AI agent capable of creating documents and pulling data from various sources to meet growing enterprise demand.

          <p>School districts across the United States are grappling with budget instability after the Trump administration temporarily froze nearly $7 billion in federal funding that was scheduled for release in July. Although the funds were eventually released after a lawsuit and outcry from legislators, the incident has left school leaders unable to count on previously reliable federal dollars. The freeze threatened funding for teacher salaries, after-school programs, and support for English learners and low-income students in districts nationwide. School administrators are now forced to plan for potential future cuts, creating significant stress and uncertainty as the new school year begins.</p>

          <p>The joint press conference between President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer highlighted several key areas of agreement and managed disagreement. Trump expressed strong disappointment with Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war but stopped short of committing to new sanctions, while Starmer carefully navigated the UK's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood, framing it as a peace initiative. The leaders also discussed online safety, with Starmer defending the UK's Online Safety Act by focusing on child protection. Notably, Trump sidestepped a question about his past praise for Peter Mandelson, who was recently fired by Starmer over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut is expected to have a varied impact on consumers, with some borrowers seeing immediate relief while savers may face lower returns. The reduction will likely lead to lower rates for variable-rate products like home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) within a month or two. Mortgage rates have already declined in anticipation of the move, but credit card holders are unlikely to notice a significant difference due to already high APRs. Conversely, yields on high-yield savings accounts and CDs are expected to drop, prompting advice for savers to lock in current rates before they fall further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of 22 state attorneys general and 254 consumer advocacy organizations has formally opposed a proposed Trump administration rule that would narrow eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The new regulation aims to disqualify employees of organizations involved in work the administration deems contrary to public order, such as those related to illegal immigration. Opponents argue the rule is unconstitutional and unlawfully punishes public servants based on the president's political preferences. The PSLF program, established in 2007, is designed to cancel federal student loan debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of payments.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission and seven states have filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and Ticketmaster, accusing the companies of enabling ticket brokers to acquire and resell vast quantities of tickets at inflated prices. The lawsuit alleges that Ticketmaster, which controls a majority of the primary ticketing market, intentionally ignored brokers who violated ticket purchasing limits. This practice allegedly allowed the company to collect an additional $3.7 billion in resale fees between 2019 and 2024. The legal action claims these practices violate consumer protection laws and adds to the intense scrutiny the company has faced since its mishandling of Taylor Swift's Eras tour ticket sales.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump praised ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show, calling the comedian an untalented person with poor ratings. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted FCC Chair Brendan Carr to suggest regulatory action against the network. The move has ignited a firestorm of criticism from Democrats, who accuse the administration of a corrupt abuse of power and an assault on the First Amendment. In response, Democratic lawmakers have called for Carr's resignation and announced plans to introduce legislation aimed at protecting speech critical of the government from censorship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC is being framed as a case of government censorship through "jawboning," where an executive agency pressures a private company to silence speech it dislikes. The move came hours after FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, threatened regulatory action against ABC and its parent company, Disney, over Kimmel's monologue on Charlie Kirk's death. This event is part of a broader, accelerating crackdown on anti-Trump speech, following the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show under similar pressure. The article argues that when media companies capitulate to such threats, free speech and a free press are fundamentally undermined.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law regulations to allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country freely. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the decision is intended to keep more young people in Ukraine by offering them freedom of movement, insisting it will not compromise the nation's defense capabilities. The move has generated debate, with some viewing it positively while others see it as unfair to active military personnel. While border officials have not noted a significant surge in departures from this age group, young men are using the opportunity for short-term travel, work, and family visits.</p>

After evacuating, her family opened their nearby restaurant to first responders and community members, offering free meals. One evening, at a neighbor's suggestion, Capsouto was lifted onto a table and played her violin for the exhausted crowd, discovering the powerful, non-verbal connection music could create. This experience profoundly shaped her life, leading her to become a professional violinist and an advocate for equity in classical music.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming campaign memoir, former presidential nominee Kamala Harris reveals she was mortified as her running mate, Tim Walz, "fumbled" a crucial answer during the 2024 vice-presidential debate against JD Vance. Harris writes that Walz fell into Vance's trap of "fake bipartisanship" and failed to effectively counter attacks or pivot to key campaign messages. The book, titled "107 Days," also discloses that her first choice for vice president would have been then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, but she ultimately decided against it, believing it was "too big of a risk" for the ticket at that time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis in the journal Nature Food calculates that an hour of the most severe pain experienced by chickens raised for meat can be prevented for just half a cent to three cents. The extreme suffering, including disabling lameness and heart failure, is a direct result of decades of breeding for unnaturally rapid growth. Researchers argue that switching to slower-growing chicken breeds, a key tenet of the Better Chicken Commitment, could eliminate about 33 hours of disabling and excruciating pain per bird. The study aims to create a "welfare footprint," providing a metric for animal suffering that can be factored into food policy alongside environmental and economic costs.</p>
