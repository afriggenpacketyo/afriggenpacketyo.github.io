According to the ethics commission report, De León failed to disclose $109,231 in income he had received from the foundation before he took office. The ethics commission noted the violations in this case are serious and that “the violations appear to indicate a pattern of conduct.”</p>

            <p>The Tren de Aragua gang, originating from a prison in Venezuela, has gained notoriety for its criminal activities both within the country and internationally. The gang, which once controlled the Tocorón prison, has expanded into drug trafficking, extortion, and other crimes, impacting countries like Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Chile. The gang's rise is attributed to Venezuela's economic crisis and the group has been increasingly associated with the immigration debate in the U.S., with the Trump administration designating it as a threat.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary "Easter truce" in Ukraine, effective from 6 p.m. Saturday to midnight Sunday. The ceasefire is intended for humanitarian purposes, but Putin stated that Russian forces should be prepared to respond to any violations or provocations from the Ukrainian side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, citing ongoing Russian drone strikes and questioning Putin's sincerity. The announcement follows frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, pending further review. The ACLU filed an emergency appeal, arguing that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the act without allowing detainees to argue their case in court. The Trump administration has invoked the act to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing they pose a threat to national security. The ACLU has argued that these deportations violate due process rights.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by the January wildfires are suing major California insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging they colluded to force homeowners into accepting the California FAIR Plan. The lawsuit claims the insurers violated antitrust and unfair competition laws by eliminating competition and intentionally pushing homeowners to the FAIR Plan. The FAIR Plan, designed to provide insurance in high-risk areas, has become overwhelmed due to insurers canceling coverage. The plaintiffs are seeking three times the damages they have sustained, arguing that the insurers are engaging in cartel-like behavior. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Lina, a domestic violence victim in Spain, was assessed as "medium" risk by the VioGén police algorithm, which evaluates the likelihood of repeat attacks. Despite reporting threats from her ex-partner, her request for a restraining order was denied, and she was murdered weeks later. The case raises concerns about the reliability and impact of algorithmic risk assessments in domestic violence cases, with critics suggesting police are over-reliant on the tool. The interior ministry has been reluctant to allow independent audits of VioGén, raising questions about potential biases and the effectiveness of the system.</p>
