The endorsement reversed a recent stock slump for the company, which had been facing criticism over the campaign's slogan.

          <p>As interest resumes for student loan borrowers in the paused SAVE plan, financial experts are warning of costly consequences for those who do not transition to an active repayment schedule. Remaining in the forbearance will cause loan balances to grow and will not count toward progress for loan forgiveness programs. The Department of Education will likely move these borrowers into a new plan eventually, but advisors recommend proactively switching to an available Income-Driven Repayment plan to better manage the debt.

          <p>The UK's Reform party has welcomed a new member, Rupert Matthews, a Conservative police and crime commissioner who is also an author of books on ghosts, UFOs, and other paranormal topics.

          <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence is fueling a massive construction boom for data centers across the U.S., as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta dramatically increase their infrastructure spending. An analysis reveals that Northern Virginia and Arizona's Maricopa County are the primary hubs for this growth, which is often incentivized by significant local tax breaks. This unprecedented expansion is also raising serious concerns about the immense environmental impact, particularly the vast consumption of electricity and water by these facilities.</p>

The restructuring will see some Wondery teams consolidated under the Audible division to better align its narrative and creator-led content strategies. This move is taking place as Amazon's audio ventures face intensified competition from the rising popularity of video podcasts on platforms such as YouTube.</p>

The initiative faces strong opposition from legal experts who question the constitutionality of state-run immigration detention and from advocates who allege rights violations and inhumane conditions at the Florida site.</p>

          <p>Former heads of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including a commissioner appointed by Donald Trump himself, have strongly condemned his decision to fire the current chief, Erika McEntarfer. The dismissal followed a weak July jobs report that Trump, without evidence, labeled as "faked" and "rigged." These former officials and other non-partisan groups have called the action a dangerous attack on the credibility of essential federal economic data, arguing that political dissatisfaction with the numbers is not a valid reason for removal.</p>

          <p>The "60% rule" is a critical regulation affecting seniors who use a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) to access their home's value. This Federal Housing Administration guideline limits borrowers to withdrawing a maximum of 60% of their total available loan amount within the first year. The rule is intended to protect homeowners from rapidly exhausting their equity, but it can create difficulties for those who need a larger lump sum for immediate financial needs, requiring them to wait a full year to access the remaining funds.
