            <p>An opinion piece in Vox accuses Donald Trump of continuing to push the false narrative that the 2020 election was fraudulent. The author argues that Trump is abusing his power to impose consequences for those who don't comply with his version of events, which is a violation of the First Amendment. The article appeared in The Logoff newsletter, which focuses on the Trump administration. The piece suggests Trump's actions are a troubling sign of his willingness to manipulate government power for political gain.</p>

            <p>A recent CNBC/Survey Monkey poll reveals that 73% of Americans are financially stressed, with 66% attributing it to tariff wars. Rising prices for essentials and interest rates also contribute to this stress. While inflation has cooled since its peak in 2022, the increased prices have diminished Americans' purchasing power. The survey also found that 59% of Americans oppose President Trump's tariff policy, and 34% have altered their investments due to market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

This outcome has led to disappointment in New Delhi, especially after India proactively engaged with Trump's team, hoping for exemptions similar to those under the Biden administration.

The U.S. is pulling back from hard power, soft power, and economic power, raising questions about the direction of the country. Trump's erratic trade policies and cuts to programs like USAID are seen as voluntary abdications of influence.

The bill would require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, potentially affecting millions of women whose voter registration name differs from their birth certificate. Opponents argue the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters. Supporters claim it's necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting, though noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is delaying the implementation of new safety standards to protect coal miners from deadly dust exposure.

The resolution passed with a narrow vote, with some Republicans opposing it. The budget plan allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and pass Trump's agenda with a simple majority. The plan includes spending cuts, but Democrats argue it will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs.</p>
