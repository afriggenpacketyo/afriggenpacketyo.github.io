          <p>President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia, marking the first meeting between a U.S. president and a Syrian leader in decades. Trump announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria to encourage its "greatness" and urged al-Sharaa to normalize ties with Israel and combat terrorism. Al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, expressed hope for Syria to become a key trade link and invited American investment in Syrian oil and gas. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham cautioned against easing sanctions without congressional approval and coordination with allies, particularly Israel.</p>

          <p>A kindergarten student in Pennsylvania distributed alcoholic jello shots to three classmates, leading to an investigation by the Greater Johnstown School District.

The district is cooperating with authorities to determine how the student obtained the alcoholic items and ensure student safety. The school has also made counselors available to assist students in processing the day's events, and is committed to transparency while limited by student privacy laws.</p>

          <p>According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin will not be attending the peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, instead sending a hard-line aide to lead the Russian delegation. President Trump, who had expressed interest in attending, will also skip the talks but send Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Ukrainian President Zelensky said he is awaiting Russia's delegation list before deciding on Ukraine's approach and urged strong sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting. The stakes are high as the war has depleted Russian forces and equipment, while Ukrainian forces have lost ground despite U.S. security assistance.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented individual in her courtroom, leading to charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction. Dugan argues she is entitled to judicial immunity and has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>

The seizure, valued at nearly $60,000, included various brands stored in 749 cartons across ten pieces of luggage. The passengers could not provide permits for transporting such a large quantity of tobacco, leading to potential penalties for violating import laws.

          <p>Forty years after the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia, some residents feel the city hasn't adequately addressed the tragedy or honored the victims. On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police bombed a rowhome occupied by MOVE, a Black liberation group, resulting in a fire that killed 11 people, including five children, and destroyed dozens of homes. While a historical marker exists, some argue it doesn't fully capture the trauma and grief experienced by the community. There is a call for Philadelphia schools to include the events of that day in their curriculum, but the city has largely closed this chapter according to some.</p>

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article examines how frustrations with unfair representation in early Hollywood led to the creation of the Great Wall Film Company in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Chinese leaders, disappointed by demeaning portrayals of their community in film, were encouraged to make their own movies. Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do founded the studio, reflecting a "do-it-yourself" mentality within Chinese-American communities. The studio later moved to Shanghai, producing films distributed in the U.S. and China, and the Lee family continued their impact with the New York Chinese Film Exchange.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Missouri approved a new referendum to repeal the abortion-rights amendment approved by voters last year, seeking instead to ban most abortions with exceptions for rape and incest. The proposed constitutional amendment would go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election. The measure passed the Republican-led House and Senate despite protests. The new measure would allow abortions only for medical emergencies, fetal anomalies, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, and would also prohibit gender transition procedures for minors.</p>

Chang became involved in natural dyes after growing tired of the toxic fabrics in the fashion industry. The art of indigo connects cultures, carries a rich history, and has medicinal benefits. Chang's work inspired her children's book, "My Indigo World," which shares the science and history behind indigo dye.</p>

          <p>A hotline providing direct communication between the Pentagon and the air traffic control tower at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has been non-functional since March 2022. This revelation came during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, prompted by a deadly collision between an Army helicopter and a commercial jet in January. The FAA said it was unaware of the issue until after the accident and is insisting on its repair before resuming operations out of the Pentagon. A professor of air traffic control noted that hotlines are common for coordinating with critical agencies.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal Israel is preparing sites in Gaza for aid distribution, part of a controversial plan involving private companies and security contractors. The UN has condemned Israel's blockade, which has caused severe shortages. The US supports the new system, but UN agencies refuse to cooperate, citing humanitarian principles. The BBC verified the construction of roads and staging areas at multiple locations. Critics argue the plan will cut off vulnerable populations from aid, while Oxfam calls it a "farce," urging Israel to lift the siege and open crossings.</p>
