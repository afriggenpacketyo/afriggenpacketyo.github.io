          <p>Gilead Sciences will pay $202 million to settle claims that it paid kickbacks to doctors to prescribe its HIV drugs.

This violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and resulted in false claims being made to federal healthcare programs. The settlement includes payments to the U.S. government and various states.</p>

This data suggests that investors should avoid panic selling during volatile periods and may even consider buying more stocks (not investment advice).</p>
