          <p>A major Republican spending bill moving through Congress would severely impact reproductive rights by defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood for a decade. The legislation also aims to cut Medicaid and create incentives for insurers to drop or increase the cost of abortion coverage under the Affordable Care Act. These measures come three years after the overturning of Roe v. Wade and could lead to the closure of nearly 200 clinics, affecting access to a wide range of health services, including contraception and cancer screenings, for over a million patients nationwide.</p>

The Kootenai County Sheriff stated that the firefighters were responding to a blaze at Canfield Mountain when a gunman opened fire on them. The suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, is believed to have intentionally started the fire to lure the first responders to the scene.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with votes on a significant Republican-backed spending and tax cut package, aiming to meet a July 4th deadline set by the president. The legislation faces internal GOP dissent, with some senators opposing the bill over its impact on Medicaid and the national debt, which is projected to increase by trillions. Despite Democratic opposition and stalling tactics, Republican leadership is pushing forward, though the bill's passage remains uncertain due to a narrow majority and criticism from conservative groups and prominent figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Yale Budget Lab analysis of the Republican spending bill indicates it would significantly benefit the wealthiest Americans while financially harming the lowest earners. The report projects that the bottom 20% of households would see an average annual income reduction of 2.9%, primarily due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% of households would experience an average income increase of 2.2%, largely from the extension of tax cuts. These findings suggest the legislation's policies are regressive in nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward peace and stability. The action follows a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former insurgent leader. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it retains targeted restrictions on former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Administration officials emphasized that the goal is to give Syria's new interim government an opportunity to rebuild, while encouraging steps like normalizing relations with neighbors, including Israel.</p>

Lee stated he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock.

This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account. Calculations show that for 3-month and 6-month terms, CDs currently offer a slightly higher return, while a money market account outperforms a 9-month CD. However, since money market rates are variable and expected to fall with anticipated Fed rate cuts, the fixed, guaranteed return of a CD may be more attractive for some savers.

The piece contends that the "One Big Beautiful Bill" exacerbates inequality by cutting social programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. Furthermore, it argues the bill actively undermines American competitiveness by throttling the renewable energy industry, which in turn could slow progress in the power-hungry AI sector.

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has become a vocal opponent of his own party's major spending bill, arguing it breaks promises by making deep cuts to Medicaid. In a fiery floor speech, Tillis stated the bill would cause 663,000 of his constituents to lose health coverage and that he would withhold his vote until the issue is addressed. His stand, which came after he announced he would not seek reelection, highlights a significant rift within the GOP over the legislation's impact on social programs, potentially complicating its path to passage in the narrowly divided Senate.</p>

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow funds, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a particularly timely option this July. With average home equity at a record high, HELOCs offer a way to access significant funds, often with a quicker approval process than unsecured loans. Interest rates on HELOCs are variable and have decreased since last fall, positioning current borrowers to benefit from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the flexible structure of a HELOC, where interest is only paid on the amount used, offers a less burdensome alternative to lump-sum loans. (not investment advice)</p>

This legal action is the latest in a series against so-called sanctuary jurisdictions and seeks to block Los Angeles from enforcing its ordinance.

          <p>The introduction of electronic line-calling at Wimbledon, replacing human line judges for the first time, has drawn mixed reactions from players and fans. While many players acknowledge the system's accuracy, some, like American Frances Tiafoe, miss the tradition and fan drama of the challenge system. Other players have noted that the automated voice calls are sometimes too quiet to hear clearly over the crowd noise. The change marks a significant shift for the historic tournament, moving from a long-standing tradition to a more technologically precise, yet less theatrical, officiating system.</p>

The author contends that the tax, now set at 1% in the Senate bill, would push billions of dollars into unregulated channels like cryptocurrency, complicating law enforcement's ability to track illicit funds. Furthermore, it could destabilize economies in countries like Mexico that rely heavily on these funds, potentially eroding diplomatic goodwill and fueling more migration.

          <p>When a debt collector denies a dispute, consumers still have several options to resolve the issue and protect their finances. This article outlines five strategies, including negotiating a settlement for less than the full amount owed or working with a credit counseling agency on a debt management plan. Other possibilities include using a debt consolidation loan to pay off the account, inquiring about hardship programs offered by the creditor, or, in severe cases, considering bankruptcy. Each path has distinct benefits and drawbacks, requiring careful consideration of one's financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest Senate version of the Republican spending bill includes provisions that would impose a significant tax hike on the clean energy industry and abruptly end key subsidies. The draft legislation introduces a new tax on wind and solar projects that use components from China and phases out crucial tax credits after 2027. Trade groups warn these measures could raise the industry's tax burden by up to $7 billion, jeopardize hundreds of thousands of construction jobs, and potentially increase electricity prices for consumers. The proposal represents a major financial blow to the renewable energy sector.</p>
