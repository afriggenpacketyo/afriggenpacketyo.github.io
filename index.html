        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At China's Canton Fair, exporters are observing a significant increase in yuan-denominated trade settlements, reflecting a warming trend towards the Chinese currency in international commerce. Customers from countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Central Asian nations like Kazakhstan are actively requesting yuan for transactions, and new clients are being encouraged to consider it. For some companies, yuan-settled orders now account for 10-20% of their total exports, a substantial rise from single-digit figures last year. This growth is partly attributed to Chinese suppliers' involvement in overseas data center projects and the ongoing demand for essential power infrastructure in developing countries, signaling a strategic shift in global payment preferences and a move away from traditional currencies.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for a higher open on Tuesday, extending positive momentum from the week's start, largely driven by strong performances in the region's defense sector. Major indices like the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 are projected to rise. Defense companies such as Thyssenkrupp and Rheinmetall saw significant gains following the spinout and IPO of TKMS and geopolitical tensions. This article highlights that U.S. stock futures and Asia-Pacific markets also traded higher, with South Korea's Kospi index jumping over 2% to a sixth consecutive record high, spurred by optimism around an impending U.S. trade deal. Investors are now awaiting a busy earnings week from companies like Netflix and Coca-Cola, which could further inform market trajectory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history by winning Japan's parliamentary vote, becoming the country's first woman prime minister. Her victory, securing 237 votes in the Lower House, follows a coalition agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party, though JIP may support from outside the cabinet. Domestic stock markets, particularly the Nikkei 225, cheered her ascendancy, hitting a fresh high in what experts are calling the "Takaichi trade," driven by expectations of looser monetary policy and larger fiscal stimulus. This article notes Takaichi's challenging path to power and her hardline conservative views, often labeled an apostle of "Abenomics," advocating for a tough stance on China and revising Japan's pacifist constitution, while also needing to maintain good international relations.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is experiencing a significant downturn, with four consecutive defeats leaving them fourth in the Premier League, four points behind leaders Arsenal. The team appears vulnerable defensively, lethargic in midfield, and lacking attacking prowess, despite Arne Slot spending nearly £450m on new talent. This article raises key questions for Slot, including how to integrate expensive signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, and address Mohamed Salah's uncharacteristic goal drought. Defensive issues, particularly with full-backs like Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and vulnerability to set-pieces, are highlighted as major concerns. The team has conceded 11 goals this season compared to three at the same point last year, underscoring the urgent need for tactical adjustments to prevent further decline.</p>

WindBorne Systems, a smart weather balloon company, has since stated the object may have been one of their weather balloons and is cooperating with investigations by the FAA and NTSB. The company has already implemented changes to minimize time spent at high altitudes and is accelerating plans for autonomous plane avoidance, alongside new hardware designs to reduce impact force.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva supports the plans, arguing oil revenue will fund Brazil's climate transition, while Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira cited energy sovereignty.

She worked diligently as the first female Space Shuttle pilot in 1995, determined to establish a strong reputation for women in space, stating she "didn't want people to say 'the woman made a mistake'." This article highlights her subsequent promotion to commander and her candid reflections on balancing motherhood with command, even navigating the shuttle through a risky 360-degree flip after the Columbia disaster to check for damage, demonstrating her brave leadership and unwavering commitment.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, a U.S. man who faked his death and fled to Scotland, has been jailed for at least five years after being convicted of sexual assault in Utah. Rossi, 38, was found guilty in two separate trials for assaulting two women in 2008. Judge Barry G. Lawrence described him as a "serial abuser of women" and the "very definition of a flight risk" due to his attempts to evade investigation, including adopting an alias, Arthur Knight, and claiming mistaken identity. This article details his bizarre court appearances in Scotland, where he used a wheelchair and oxygen mask, and his subsequent extradition, with one victim stating Rossi left a "trail of fear, pain and destruction" that will never fully heal.</p>

          <p>Chinese coastguard vessels were observed patrolling disputed reefs controlled by Vietnam in the South China Sea last week, including Grierson Reef and Sin Cowe Island. The purpose of the patrol by vessels 4301, 5009, and 21559 remains unclear. This action occurs amid heightened tensions in the region, where China has territorial disputes with multiple claimants, and despite recent commitments between Beijing and Hanoi to "properly handle maritime issues." This article notes that while China's coastguard frequently clashes with Philippine vessels, open confrontations with Vietnam have been less common. Satellite monitoring data from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies indicates China is upgrading 11 features in ongoing building work, further escalating concerns about militarization in the strategically vital waterway.</p>

          <p>Climate scientists are sounding the alarm that glaciers in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, which have persisted for at least 30,000 years, are now projected to vanish by 2100 due to steadily rising global temperatures. A recent study of two large glaciers near Yosemite National Park revealed they remained continuously ice-covered even during warmer periods of the Holocene, making their current rapid ice melt an "abrupt reversal of long-term glacier growth." This article highlights the significant ecological implications for plants and animals, the symbolic loss of iconic American West features, and the far-reaching impacts of glacier loss, including further sea-level rise, increased coastal erosion, and potential freshwater shortages downstream, underscoring the urgency of reducing fossil fuel reliance and carbon emissions.</p>

The compact demanded reforms on race/ethnicity in admissions, strict gender definitions, tuition freezes, and international student caps.

          <p>Buckingham Palace is facing renewed questions regarding its knowledge and handling of the Prince Andrew scandal, particularly after new evidence emerged from Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir and Epstein documents.

The article highlights that despite Andrew ceasing to be a working royal in 2019, the period under scrutiny—when he was a working royal and trade representative—raises questions about what royal officials and government departments knew. Unanswered questions also persist about Andrew's finances, including his residence at Royal Lodge, and connections to business deals with China, fueling calls for greater transparency and parliamentary accountability regarding his titles and succession status.</p>
