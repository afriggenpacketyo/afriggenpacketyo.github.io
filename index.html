          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has released its final report on the 2023 Titan submersible incident, concluding that faulty engineering led to the fatal implosion. The report states that operator OceanGate failed to adequately test the carbon fiber hull, was unaware of its low durability, and misinterpreted real-time monitoring data from a previous dive that indicated damage. The investigation also noted that had OceanGate followed standard emergency response guidance, the debris would have been found sooner, saving time and resources, even though a rescue was not possible. The tragedy killed all five passengers, including the company's CEO.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the alleged release of prisoners into the United States. This confirmation follows a New York Times report and comes amid increased U.S. military activity in the Caribbean, including airstrikes on suspected drug boats that have killed at least 27 people. The Venezuelan government condemned the move as "warmongering" and an attempt at regime change, while some U.S. lawmakers have questioned the legal authority for military force against drug traffickers without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, successfully raised over $125,000 to continue their lawsuit against the local public school district after a federal judge ordered them to post the significant bond. The funds are meant to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose their case, which was filed after their sons were suspended for sexual harassment for objecting to a transgender classmate using the boys' locker room. Supported by the America First Legal group, the case highlights the ongoing national debate over transgender student rights and school policies, with the parents now able to proceed with their legal challenge.</p>

          <p>According to President Trump, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for the halt remains unclear. Trump described the commitment as a significant step in isolating Moscow economically over its war in Ukraine and mentioned that the halt would be a "little bit of a process." India is one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, and its continued trade has been a point of contention in its relationship with Washington, which previously imposed additional tariffs on the country to discourage the purchases.</p>

          <p>All major Chinese airlines flying to the United States, including Air China, have formally filed their opposition to a U.S. Department of Transportation proposal. The plan would prohibit them from using Russian airspace on U.S. routes, a measure that could take effect as early as next month. Air China argued the restriction would cause significant disruption for thousands of passengers during the holiday season and requested a 60-day grace period if the rule is implemented. This move represents another point of friction in the escalating trade and geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate leaders from companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Microsoft to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom in the White House's East Wing. The project, which broke ground last month, is being financed entirely by private donations rather than taxpayer money, a move that has drawn criticism from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren. The administration says the 90,000-square-foot expansion is necessary for hosting large functions, and the president thanked attendees for their generous contributions, stating the cost has been "fully taken care of."</p>

Manager Dave Roberts commented that the team cannot win the World Series with such a performance from its key slugger. Ohtani downplayed suggestions that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting, stating he does not feel a direct physical connection between the two roles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after the administration sent termination notices to over 4,000 employees, with the White House budget director suggesting the number could exceed 10,000. Judge Susan Yvonne Illston cited the administration's unprecedented actions and President Trump's own social media posts as evidence that the firings were intended to punish political opponents. The order applies to employees represented by the two unions that filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted the man accused of starting the wildfire that devastated the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles, resulting in 12 deaths. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, now faces three federal charges, including destruction of property by fire and arson, with a potential sentence of up to 45 years in prison. Prosecutors allege that Rinderknecht, working as an Uber driver, ignited a brush fire that smoldered for nearly a week before high winds transformed it into one of the most destructive blazes in the city's history. A motive has not been described.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new requirement for a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa is already causing significant disruption in the tech industry, particularly for small businesses and startups. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the policy is slowing hiring and shrinking the available talent pool for highly specialized roles, such as AI development. In response, companies are beginning to focus more on upskilling their existing American workforces and building new talent pipelines from U.S. universities. However, experts worry this could stifle innovation, as many successful tech founders have historically been immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief has proposed a plan to address the high cost and social tension associated with housing asylum seekers in hotels. The idea involves the government providing funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding to the nation's social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. This approach could drastically cut the annual cost per asylum seeker from £54,000 in a hotel to just £4,000 in social housing. The proposal is reportedly being discussed with government departments as a potential long-term solution to empty the 210 hotels currently in use.</p>

Johnson & Johnson denies the allegations, stating its product was compliant with regulations, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.

Under the agreement, Hamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages, and Israel is to release the bodies of 15 Palestinians for each one.
