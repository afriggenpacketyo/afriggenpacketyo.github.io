          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports and significant Indonesian purchases of US goods. The deal would grant American firms greater access to Indonesian markets, with Trump stating the U.S. would pay no tariffs. While Indonesia's president confirmed a positive discussion took place, he did not confirm the specific terms of the agreement. This move is part of a broader strategy where the administration has been negotiating new trade terms with multiple countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Rate for June Exceeds Economic Forecasts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate unexpectedly rose to 3.6% in June, surpassing economists' predictions of 3.4%. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase primarily to motor fuel prices, while food price inflation also continued to climb. This data puts pressure on the Bank of England, which is trying to manage high inflation alongside sluggish economic growth. Despite the higher inflation figure, many economists still anticipate an interest rate cut in August to stimulate the contracting economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace has defended the decision to obtain a court injunction to prevent reporting on a major data leak. The breach exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK relocation assistance, putting them at potential risk from the Taliban. Wallace stated the primary goal was to protect those individuals, not to engage in a cover-up. The details of the leak and the subsequent creation of a new resettlement scheme only became public after a judge lifted the gagging order.</p>

          <p>A farmer in Jones, Oklahoma, was killed after being attacked by two water buffaloes inside their enclosure. The man, identified as Bradley McMichael, had reportedly purchased the animals at a livestock auction just one day prior to the incident. First responders were initially unable to reach the victim due to the animals' aggressive behavior, forcing them to dispatch both water buffaloes to secure the scene. Police believe McMichael became trapped while tending to the animals, and the investigation into the fatal attack is ongoing.</p>

The author argues that the weaponization of the dollar through sanctions and massive US national debt are accelerating this "de-dollarization" trend.

          <p>A court in South Korea has begun retrying Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who was executed for assassinating President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim claimed he killed the dictator to prevent a bloodbath and restore democracy, but was convicted of insurrection by a military court. His family fought for the retrial, arguing the original trial was unjust and involved torture, a claim the court accepted as a valid reason to rehear the case. The retrial forces a re-examination of a pivotal, traumatic moment in the nation's history and the legacy of a deeply polarizing figure.</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the MLB All-Star Game after the contest was decided by the first-ever home run swing-off. The game was tied 6-6 after nine innings, triggering the new tiebreaker rule where three batters from each league take three swings. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs to give the NL a 4-3 edge in the swing-off, earning him the game's MVP award. The American League had staged a late-game comeback from a 6-0 deficit to force the dramatic and novel conclusion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, will surge to record levels this year. The increased demand is driven by the opening of new petrochemical plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane due to trade war-related supply uncertainties. Consultancies forecast that imports could reach up to 17 million metric tons, a significant increase from 2024. This robust demand from China is expected to provide support for Asian refiners' profit margins for the feedstock throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly planning to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program in college sports. This move follows the advancement of a House bill aimed at creating a federal framework to supersede the current patchwork of state laws governing how student-athletes can be compensated. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have reshaped college athletics by allowing athletes to earn millions from endorsements and other deals. The proposed order signals the administration's engagement on the complex issue of athlete compensation.</p>

The story is told through the memories of survivors, who were children at the time, and historical accounts from those involved in the mission.
