            <p>A helicopter crashed into the Hudson River off Manhattan, resulting in the deaths of all six individuals on board, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The incident marks the deadliest helicopter crash in the New York area in recent years, and authorities have launched an investigation to determine the cause. Initial reports suggest some of the victims were tourists from Spain, and video footage circulating on social media depicts the helicopter inverted in the river. Eyewitness accounts indicate the helicopter may have lost a propeller before plummeting into the water.</p>

            <p>European Union leaders are planning a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing in late July, signaling a renewed effort to engage with China. The decision to hold the summit in Beijing, despite the usual rotation of locations, underscores the importance of face-to-face discussions with Xi. This initiative comes as the EU's relationship with the United States has deteriorated following President Trump's return to the White House, marked by tariff disputes and a shift in US policy towards Ukraine, leaving Europeans to perceive him as aligned with Russia.</p>

The survey also found that 59% of Americans oppose President Trump's tariff policy, and 72% are concerned about its impact on their personal finances.

            <p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled in favor of Sony Pictures Television, granting them the right to take over distribution of their popular game shows “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune” from CBS. Sony had terminated its distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and failure to maximize advertising revenues. CBS plans to appeal the ruling, arguing that the contract with Sony is not yet dead and expressing confidence in prevailing at trial. The shows, owned by Sony and produced on their Culver City lot, remain highly successful despite the decline in traditional TV viewership.</p>

            <p>India's diplomatic efforts to engage with the US under President Trump's administration have faced challenges following the announcement of new tariff policies. Despite initial engagement and concessions on tariffs, India appears disappointed by the US's stance, with opposition leaders expressing concerns about the potential impact on the Indian economy. While a temporary reprieve on tariffs has been granted, uncertainty remains regarding the future trajectory of the bilateral relationship.

A consent decree would require Columbia to agree to binding terms approved by a federal judge.

            <p>President Trump's policies are creating a tension between his push for American retrenchment and his desire to "Make America great again." The US is retreating from hard power, surrendering soft power, and yielding economic power, raising questions about the true meaning of greatness. The latest flip-flops on trade war policy and the pullback from Europe are examples of Trump's erratic approach, leading to wariness about treating the American financial system as a haven. This approach may be a bizarre way to increase American stature, and echoes other Trump moves that voluntarily abdicate influence.</p>

            <p>The feeling of financial insecurity is deepening for Americans across all income levels, with nearly half feeling more stressed than a year ago, according to a CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll. Inflation, high interest rates, tariffs, and looming layoffs contribute to the pressure. The cost of essentials is reshaping household budgets, leaving even six-figure earners struggling. While many remain optimistic, a similar percentage worry about a future economic decline. Discretionary spending is declining as people cut back on non-essential items and even essential spending, reflecting a deeper feeling that earnings never stretch far enough (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>The proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, could create barriers to voter registration for married women who have changed their last names. While the bill does not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, it would require them to show additional documentation to prove citizenship. This is because common forms of ID, like driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as proof of citizenship. Experts say this could disproportionately affect women who have taken their spouse's name and may not have a matching birth certificate.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has delayed the implementation of new safety standards designed to protect coal miners from hazardous dust exposure.

            <p>China is reducing the number of Hollywood films allowed in the country amid escalating trade tensions with the United States. This decision follows President Trump's move to boost tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. The China Film Administration stated that it would "moderately reduce the number of American films imported." While stopping short of a full ban, this action reduces access to a vital market for U.S. blockbusters. The move comes as China invests heavily in its own local film industry and as relations between the two global superpowers have become strained.</p>

House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue significant spending cuts. Approving the budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.</p>
