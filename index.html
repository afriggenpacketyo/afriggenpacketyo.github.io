          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was forced to divert to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large for the Naples airport. Passengers were then transported by bus for approximately three hours to reach their final destination. American Airlines stated that the diversion was due to operational limitations, as the airline typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. The airline apologized for the disruption to the passengers' travel plans, but ultimately this resulted in a delay for travelers. Optimism is tempered due to the inconvenience caused to travelers.</p>

From Taft's concern about public perception to Eisenhower's avid playing and Trump's integration of golf into his work, the article highlights the varying roles golf has played in presidential life. Reagan curtailed his golf after a terrorist attack in Beirut, and George W. Bush stopped playing during the second Iraq war. The article concludes by noting Trump's unique obsession with golf compared to his predecessors, and how the game has played a part in his presidency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers, particularly aircraft mechanics, as the average age of certified mechanics is 54. A report indicates that the U.S. will be short 25,000 aircraft technicians by 2028, exacerbated by COVID-19 buyouts of experienced workers. Companies like GE Aerospace are trying to attract younger people with competitive salaries, but geographic immobility and a perceived lack of appeal in manufacturing jobs pose challenges. While wages have increased for technicians, some argue they need to rise further to address the impending workforce shortage, which could impact the entire world.</p>

          <p>Italians are voting in a two-day referendum concerning changes to citizenship and labor laws, triggered by an NGO-led grassroots campaign. One key question involves reducing the residency requirement for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 years to 5 years, aiming to improve integration for second-generation immigrants. Voters will also decide on greater worker protections against dismissal and improved compensation for workplace accidents. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government is urging supporters to abstain, hoping to prevent the 50% turnout needed for the reforms to pass, as she opposes easing citizenship rules.</p>

Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is the epicenter of Indian chess, with a system of grassroots teaching, supportive schools, and dedicated parents. The rise of chess in India is also attributed to its resemblance to academics and the availability of career opportunities, while YouTube channels are expanding access to chess education in regional languages.</p>

Critics argue that limiting oneself to physical attributes reduces opportunities for meaningful connections, while others suggest the filter could reassure shorter men by helping them avoid women who exclusively date tall men.</p>

Examples include universities censoring course content and companies reducing DEI programs. However, the article notes a growing trend of resistance, with universities pushing back against demands, states challenging administration policies, and consumers boycotting companies that scale back diversity programs.

          <p>President Trump's proposed budget aims to slash Pell Grants, potentially reducing college access for low-income students. The maximum Pell Grant for the 2026-2027 academic year would be at its lowest level in over a decade, disproportionately affecting families with incomes below $60,000. Experts warn that these cuts could force students to drop out or take on more debt, exacerbating existing challenges in affording a four-year degree. While the Pell program functions like other entitlement programs, it relies on both mandatory and discretionary funding, with a projected shortfall this year due to more students qualifying for grants.</p>

          <p>This article argues that recent anti-Jewish attacks in the U.S., such as the firebombing in Colorado and the shooting in Washington, D.C., inadvertently strengthen the Zionist cause. By making Jewish life outside of Israel less safe and secure, these acts of violence reinforce the idea that Jews need a homeland for protection. The author contends that a truly effective anti-Zionist movement would focus on making Jews feel welcome and secure in their diaspora communities, but the current anti-Zionist movement often perpetuates anti-Semitism, pushing Jews toward Zionism.</p>

They faced legal restrictions and social stigma, but their efforts led to increased access to safe abortions and influenced policy changes in countries like Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia. The movement evolved from providing information to offering accompaniment, emphasizing support throughout the abortion process and leading to the legalization of abortion in several countries.</p>

          <p>Scotland has called up free agent Ross Doohan and Bournemouth's Callan McKenna for their friendly match in Liechtenstein due to a goalkeeping crisis. Angus Gunn and Robby McCrorie left the squad following a defeat by Iceland, and Cieran Slicker had a difficult debut after replacing the injured Gunn. Head coach Steve Clarke, who had previously expressed concern about his lack of options, is seeking to address the issue. The call-ups come as first-choice Craig Gordon and regular squad members Zander Clark and Liam Kelly are also missing from the original squad due to injury.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia have intensified their long-range strike operations, even as U.S.-brokered peace talks continue. At least 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down on their approach to Moscow, while Russian forces struck targets in Ukraine, including Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is urging Western partners to provide more air defense systems and holding Putin accountable for ignoring peace proposals. Recent barrages followed a covert Ukrainian operation targeting strategic bomber bases deep inside Russia, with both sides demonstrating an escalation in the conflict.</p>

Merz, along with other European leaders, had warned of sanctions if Russia refused to agree to a ceasefire, but no sanctions followed when the deadline was ignored.

The trend is evident in reactions to the flag of South Vietnam, which is seen by some as a symbol of American imperialism. The government's control over media and education, combined with the use of cyber troops to police online content, has contributed to a polarized discourse where dissenting views are often met with harassment.

Mexico is considering further legal action, and the U.S. has designated Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, potentially leading to terrorism-related charges for weapons traffickers.
