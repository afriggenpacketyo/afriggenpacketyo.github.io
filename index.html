            <p>China has issued a stern warning, stating it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that undermine Beijing's interests, amidst escalating trade tensions. This response comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to leverage tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners into limiting their economic engagements with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce cautioned against the risks of international trade reverting to a "law of the jungle" scenario and positioned China as a defender of international fairness, while criticizing the U.S. for abusing tariffs and engaging in unilateral bullying.

            <p>Season 2 of HBO's 'The Last of Us' has sparked debate among viewers due to its divergence from the game's storytelling, particularly concerning the death of Joel and the introduction of Abby. While the show expands on character backstories and explores themes of fractured bonds, some critics argue that it sacrifices emotional impact for shock value and deviates from the elegant insights of Season 1. The season's focus on undiluted pain and the characters' descent into darkness has made it a punishing watch for some, contrasting with the first season's emphasis on building relationships in impossible circumstances.

            <h2>Men's Health: Addressing Why Men Seek Medical Care Less Frequently</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>This article explores the reasons why men tend to visit doctors less often than women, citing factors such as societal pressure to "tough it out," concerns about appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't accommodate their work schedules. Data indicates that men are less likely to be registered at a dental practice, use a pharmacy, or attend routine appointments. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing these barriers to improve men's health outcomes and encourage them to seek medical support when needed. Optimism Score: 55</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelans deported from the U.S. in exchange for the release of political prisoners. Bukele directed his offer to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, contrasting the alleged crimes of the deportees with the political nature of the imprisonment of those in Venezuela. The offer comes amid heightened scrutiny of El Salvador's willingness to accept migrants who the Trump administration claims are gang members or violent criminals. Optimism Score: 35</p>
