          <p>The U.S. government shutdown continued as the Senate once again failed to pass rival funding bills, marking the fifth and sixth rejected votes. President Trump stated he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on healthcare if they first agreed to reopen the government, a claim Minority Leader Chuck Schumer refuted. The impasse sees federal employees facing potential layoffs, with no clear resolution in sight as both parties maintain their positions on budget and healthcare provisions. This ongoing legislative gridlock underscores the deep political divisions impacting federal operations.</p>

          <p>Virginia Attorney General candidate Jay Jones is under fire after a National Review report exposed text messages where he fantasized about harming a Republican colleague. Despite the controversy, top Democrats, including Senator Cory Booker and several House members, have not rescinded their endorsements. While some, like Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, condemned the remarks, they stopped short of calling for Jones to withdraw, stating the decision rests with voters. Jones has apologized for the "embarrassing and shameful" comments, but the incident has drawn sharp criticism from Republicans and raised questions about his fitness for office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Portland are facing significant legal challenges. Federal judges in Oregon and Illinois have issued rulings, or are considering requests, to block these deployments, questioning their necessity and constitutionality. Governors of affected states, including Oregon and Illinois, have pushed back, describing the actions as an "unconstitutional invasion" and asserting that local protests are being misrepresented. These legal battles highlight a growing conflict over the limits of presidential power in domestic law enforcement and the federalization of state military forces.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate failed for the fifth time to pass spending measures that would reopen the government, as both Democratic and Republican proposals fell short of the 60-vote threshold. President Trump warned of mass layoffs for thousands of federal employees if the shutdown continues, a threat reiterated by the White House. Democrats insist on including healthcare provisions, such as extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and reversing Medicaid cuts, in any funding bill. Republicans, however, are pushing for a "clean" funding bill, leading to a continued stalemate and uncertainty for federal workers.</p>

          <p>New research has found a link between long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a major pollutant from mining fossil fuels, and an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, published in Environmental Research, began after healthcare workers observed a higher incidence of ALS patients in New Brunswick, Canada. Researchers compared diagnosed individuals to healthy controls, estimating pollution levels at their residences and finding a significant association with sulfur dioxide exposure. While the study indicates association rather than causation, it suggests the need for further research into prevention strategies and improved regulatory intervention on air pollution.</p>

          <h2>Warning Issued on Modeling Scams Targeting Older Individuals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of modeling scams is increasingly targeting older individuals, exploiting the fashion industry's embrace of diverse looks. The scams involve phony agencies charging hundreds of pounds for fake portfolios and non-existent jobs, as experienced by 79-year-old Judy Corker and 73-year-old Roland Parker. Scammers often request payments via methods like PayPal's "friends and family" option, which offers no buyer protection. Authorities advise using "goods and services" for all purchases to ensure protection and reporting fraudulent activities to organizations like Action Fraud.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has extended into its second week, with the Senate repeatedly rejecting competing funding bills. President Trump hinted at openness to negotiating healthcare subsidies with Democrats, though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denied any direct outreach from the White House. The Trump administration has warned of federal workforce layoffs and has already cancelled funding for energy and transportation projects in Democratic-governed areas. Public polls indicate a majority of respondents hold the Republican party responsible for the shutdown, which continues to impact various government services and programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its efforts to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Portland and Chicago, despite strong objections from state and local leaders. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker described the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Chicago as an "unconstitutional invasion," while a federal judge in Oregon blocked earlier attempts to send troops to Portland. The administration justifies these actions by pointing to protests at ICE facilities, which critics argue dramatically distort the reality on the ground. This ongoing "war on cities" raises concerns about federal overreach and the militarization of domestic law enforcement.</p>

With Activision Blizzard acquired by Microsoft and Electronic Arts going private, Take-Two now stands as the sole major publicly traded American pure-play video game company, creating significant "scarcity value." The company, known for its Grand Theft Auto franchise, anticipates the highly awaited "Grand Theft Auto VI" release in May 2026.

          <p>Despite receiving an unprecedented $45 billion in new funding, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is reportedly struggling to increase arrests and detentions, with daily migrant custody numbers barely growing. Immigration arrests have fallen 11 percent since June, remaining well below the administration's 3,000-person-per-day goal, though deportations have tripled. Current and former officials express frustration, attributing the slow pace to a Homeland Security policy requiring Secretary Kristi Noem's personal approval for large contracts and the influence of DHS advisor Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski is accused of prioritizing agreements with Republican-led jurisdictions, potentially at higher costs, impacting the expansion of detention capacity.</p>

The injunction mandates Google to permit rival app stores within Play and allow developers to include external links, bypassing Google's billing system, with provisions taking effect by July 2026.

Maxwell's appeal argued that a 2007 nonprosecution agreement between Epstein and federal prosecutors in Miami should have barred her prosecution. The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject this argument, asserting the agreement's limited geographic scope. This decision means Maxwell's conviction and sentence remain intact, barring a presidential pardon, which President Trump indicated he would "take a look at" without further commitment.</p>

The victim, Max Thomas, was discovered with evidence of a struggle, and a state medical examiner confirmed an "animal mauling" as the cause of death. The bear was tracked and killed after being identified through trail camera photos and matching descriptions from the victim's own pictures. This marks the second fatal bear attack in Arkansas in recent weeks, though such incidents remain exceedingly rare.</p>

          <p>The Prosecuting Attorneys Council (PAC) of Georgia has requested an extension to appoint a new prosecutor for the state's election interference case against President Donald Trump and others. This request comes after Judge Scott McAfee set a 14-day deadline for the appointment following the effective dismissal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. Citing the case's complexity and voluminous file, PAC Executive Director Peter Skandalakis is seeking at least 90 days for the appointment. The Georgia Supreme Court recently declined Willis' appeal of her removal, leaving the high-profile racketeering case in need of new leadership.</p>

This move follows a public dispute earlier in the year between the council and the Labour government over pre-sentence reports.

Lindsey Halligan, a Trump ally with no prosecutorial experience, was recently installed as the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia and is expected to receive Yusi's conclusion.

By relinquishing the designation, China removes a key talking point used by the U.S. and EU to criticize its trade practices.
