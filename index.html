          <p>Worldcoin, co-founded by Sam Altman, has officially launched in the United States, introducing its iris-scanning technology across six retail locations. The project aims to create a global identity verification system using iris scans and blockchain to combat fraud and bots. Users who get their irises scanned by an Orb receive Worldcoin's cryptocurrency, WLD, and can use their World ID as a sign-in for integrated platforms like Minecraft and Reddit. Worldcoin has partnered with Visa to launch the 'World Visa card' and Match Group to pilot World ID on Tinder in Japan. </p>

          <p>South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo has resigned from his position, citing a desire to take on "heavier responsibility," amid speculation that he will run in the upcoming presidential election. Han, a potential conservative candidate, is expected to launch his campaign and align with the People Power Party to challenge liberal front-runner Lee Jae-myung. With Han's departure, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok will serve as acting president until the election on June 3. Han's extensive experience in economic affairs could be an asset, but critics question his lack of a strong political base.</p>

          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses. The legislation includes measures to address cross-regional enforcement issues and reinforces accountability for officials who fail to comply with the law. Analysts believe the law focuses on regulating administrative actions and limiting administrative powers, providing businesses with a legal basis to defend their interests. The law is seen as a critical step in reassuring private entrepreneurs amid increasing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns over the economic impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. While Japan's inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target, the central bank acknowledges that growth is likely to moderate due to global economic slowdown and declining domestic corporate profits. BOJ Governor Kazo Ueda cautioned that significant tariff policy changes could affect the central bank's monetary policy outlook, but expects any downward pressure to recede as overseas economies recover.</p>

          <p>The United States has called on India and Pakistan to work together to "de-escalate tensions" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held separate discussions with India's foreign minister and Pakistan's prime minister, emphasizing the need to "maintain peace and security in South Asia." India accuses Pakistan of supporting the militants responsible for the attack, while Islamabad denies the allegations. Amid escalating tensions, India has closed its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and suspended most visas for Pakistani nationals.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised down its economic and inflation projections for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs on the economy. The central bank anticipates a decline in domestic corporate profits due to trade frictions, leading to a slowdown in overseas economies. While the BOJ maintained its benchmark interest rate, it remains committed to raising rates further if economic and price conditions align with its expectations. The BOJ expects its 2% inflation goal to be attained in the latter half of three years through March 2028.</p>

The letters reflect a growing public sentiment that the release of the hostages should be the primary objective. Attendance rates for reservists have also reportedly declined, posing a potential crisis for the military.</p>
