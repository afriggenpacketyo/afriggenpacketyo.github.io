          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded her testimony in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, recounting disturbing details of alleged abuse. Ventura described a flight where Combs allegedly showed her a 'freak off' video and threatened to release it.

Ventura broke down while describing the emotional impact of these events, stating she felt 'worthless' and 'like dirt,' and would give back the $20 million settlement to undo the experiences of the 'freak offs.'</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has extended its block on the Trump administration's attempts to deport Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This order maintains a previous directive issued by the court, preventing the government from removing the migrants while their challenge to the deportations is pursued. The emergency injunction was sought by lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants, who argued they faced 'imminent' risk of removal under the invoked act. The Supreme Court's decision ensures the migrants will not be deported while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <p>Joakim Medin, a Swedish journalist, has been released from jail in Turkey after being imprisoned for 'insulting' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Medin, who works for Dagens ETC, was arrested upon arrival in Istanbul while covering protests sparked by the arrest of Istanbul's mayor. He received an 11-month suspended sentence for insulting the president and faced additional terrorism charges, which he refuted.

          <p>A House amendment to the Republican budget package proposing the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah has faced unexpected opposition from within the party. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, former Interior Secretary, voiced strong disapproval, threatening the budget bill's future. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to address the affordable housing crisis, a notion criticized for its shortsightedness. This stance contrasts with the broader historical value of public lands as shared resources for conservation and recreation.</p>

The lifting of sanctions could allow Syria to re-enter international markets, attract foreign investment, and regain diplomatic support. Lebanon hopes this move will facilitate the return of Syrian refugees and boost regional trade, but some analysts worry that Lebanon may struggle to keep pace with Syria's progress.

          <p>The Illinois House has passed legislation requiring more thorough background checks for police hires, following the killing of Sonya Massey by a former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy. The bill mandates law enforcement agencies to inspect all prior employment records before making a job offer, including fitness-for-duty examinations and investigation records. Sponsored by state Rep. Kam Buckner, the legislation aims to prevent future tragedies by ensuring comprehensive evaluation of police officer candidates. Massey's father hopes the bill will serve as a model for other states.</p>

          <p>Boeing may avoid criminal responsibility for its role in the deadly 737 Max crashes. Justice Department officials said they were entertaining a deal in which Boeing would agree to some concessions, including paying into a victims fund, but walk away without having to plead guilty to any charges, according to lawyers for the families. The lawyers described the deal as deeply disappointing and said that they would fight it in court if the department moves ahead with it. The agreement that the officials laid out would represent the latest about-face in a yearslong effort to hold Boeing accountable for two of the deadliest plane crashes in recent history.</p>
