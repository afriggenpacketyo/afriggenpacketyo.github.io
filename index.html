          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist involved in Columbia University protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was released from federal immigration detention in Louisiana after 104 days. Khalil, a Syrian-born Algerian permanent resident, stated that "justice prevailed, but it's very long overdue." A U.S. District Judge ordered his release, citing a lack of evidence that Khalil posed a flight risk or public danger. The Trump administration is still attempting to deport Khalil, alleging he lied to obtain his green card, so his legal battle continues. He is married to a US citizen and has a son who was born while he was in detention.</p>

          <p>Japan has returned the remains of ten Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, marking the country's first repatriation of this kind. The remains, taken in the 19th and 20th centuries, were held by three Japanese research institutions and handed over in a ceremony at the Australian Embassy in Tokyo. This repatriation is part of a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad for research or collection. Australia has been working with institutions worldwide for over 30 years to secure the return of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander remains, with more than 1,785 sets repatriated so far.</p>

In Minnesota, heavy winds with gusts up to 106 mph caused widespread damage in the Bemidji area, including downed trees, power lines, and flooded streets.

          <p>Multiple B-2 stealth bombers are being deployed to Guam as tensions escalate between Iran and the West over Iran's nuclear program. The bombers' presence at Andersen Air Force Base does not necessarily indicate a final decision on military action, but it reflects the Trump administration's consideration of options. In addition, eight refueling tankers took off from Oklahoma and flew over several states before returning to base. The B-2 is the only U.S. Air Force bomber capable of carrying the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, potentially for targeting Iran's underground uranium enrichment facility.</p>

The government's move follows an incident at RAF Brize Norton, which prompted a security review at military bases. Palestine Action has been targeting arms companies and claims responsibility for damaging a US military plane in Ireland. The group asserts its actions are aimed at disrupting the supply chain to what they describe as "genocide," while Israel denies allegations of genocide in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Russian government is exhibiting signs of unease as the country faces economic challenges despite reported growth. At the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, discussions extended beyond the economy, with concerns about potential military actions. President Putin emphasized the importance of winning the war against Ukraine, even at the expense of economic stability. Russia's Minister for Economic Development warned that the economy is "on the brink of recession," and the Central Bank Governor noted that unused resources have been exhausted. International sanctions due to the war in Ukraine have further diminished the shine of the Russian economy.</p>

Visitor volume in Las Vegas dipped 7.8% year-over-year in March 2025, leading to reduced gaming revenue and hotel occupancy. The decline in tourism is attributed to economic uncertainty and evolving U.S. travel policies. Casinos are introducing electronic table games to cut labor costs, leading to decreased enrollment in dealer training programs.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended the Trump administration's decision to maintain a military deployment in Los Angeles, alleging that Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass had "egged on" violence during protests. Vance referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla" during a visit to the city, drawing criticism from Newsom and Bass. The senator responded by calling the vice president and the Trump administration "petty and unserious." The incident occurred amid ongoing tensions between federal and local authorities over immigration enforcement and the deployment of troops to Los Angeles.</p>
