          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting weather warnings for the region. The National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and gusty winds. As of Saturday evening, Chantal had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving north towards the coast between Charleston, South Carolina, and Cape Fear, North Carolina. Forecasters anticipate some slight strengthening before landfall, after which the storm is expected to weaken rapidly as it moves inland. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division has cautioned residents to prepare for impacts through Monday, including high rip currents.</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned into a nightmare when a 42-year-old Texas man was struck by a boat propeller while snorkeling just feet from the shore. The former Army Ranger suffered life-threatening injuries, including multiple leg fractures and deep gashes that nearly severed his lower body. His teenage daughter had to rescue him from the water, while the boat that hit him reportedly fled the scene. The family faced a harrowing journey to get him to a hospital in Miami for emergency medical care.

          <p>New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara experienced a rough start on the baseball mound during a recent Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field. The NFL star's ceremonial first pitch went far wide of the plate, prompting him to immediately ask for a second chance. After some lighthearted boos from the crowd, the mascot tossed the ball back, and Kamara's second attempt was much more successful, reaching the catcher in the air. The moment provided a bit of levity as Kamara, a key player for the Saints, prepares for the upcoming NFL season where he is expected to take on a significant role following his quarterback's retirement.</p>

          <p>Authorities searching for Brian Tarrence, a New Yorker who went missing while on vacation in Turks and Caicos, have discovered a deceased male's body in a decomposed state. Tarrence was last seen on surveillance footage leaving his hotel on June 25. While the body has not yet been positively identified as his, the discovery was made in the Grace Bay area during an organized search. A private investigator involved in the case noted that there has been no evidence of criminality, such as suspicious credit card activity. Officials have urged the public to avoid speculation until a positive identification is made and have extended condolences to the family of the deceased.</p>

          <p>A timeline of the devastating Texas floods reveals how quickly the disaster unfolded, catching many by surprise. State emergency resources were activated on Wednesday, but weather models did not predict the extreme rainfall that caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in under an hour early Friday morning. The National Weather Service issued escalating warnings, including a rare "flash flood emergency," but these came in the pre-dawn hours when most were asleep. Local officials defended their decision not to evacuate camps sooner, citing the unpredictability and the potential chaos of a mass evacuation on rural roads. The timeline highlights a tragic gap between forecasting capabilities and on-the-ground response.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund in a chaotic match, setting up a Club World Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish team appeared dominant for most of the game, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García. However, a wild stoppage time saw Kylian Mbappé score a spectacular acrobatic goal for Madrid's third, followed by a red card for defender Dean Huijsen that will see him miss the next match. Despite a late scare from Dortmund, Real Madrid held on, showcasing the blend of young talent and star power under new manager Xabi Alonso as they move one step closer to another major trophy.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to HIV research funding under the Trump administration are raising concerns about their impact on the significant progress made toward ending the HIV epidemic in the United States. This short article questions how the reduction in financial support for scientific and medical research will affect ongoing efforts and future breakthroughs. Health experts and advocates have long argued that sustained investment is crucial for developing new prevention methods, treatments, and ultimately a cure. The funding decrease represents a potential setback for public health initiatives that have been instrumental in controlling the spread of the virus and improving the lives of those affected by it over the past several decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas Hill Country, where recent floods killed dozens, is one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for flash flooding due to its unique geography. The region's steep hills, shallow soil, and winding rivers create conditions for rapid and destructive water surges, a phenomenon known as "Flash Flood Alley." Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico rises over the Balcones Escarpment, often resulting in intense downpours that the ground cannot absorb. This article, republished from The Conversation, explains how this process can cause creeks and rivers like the Guadalupe to rise catastrophically within minutes, highlighting the immense and persistent danger faced by communities in the area.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government announced it will send a negotiating team to Qatar for ceasefire talks but has deemed the latest proposals from Hamas as "unacceptable." The decision came after Hamas issued what it called a "positive response" to a U.S.-mediated framework for a truce in the long-running conflict. Despite the public rejection of Hamas's requested changes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed the delegation would proceed with indirect talks.

Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China.

          <p>President Trump's administration is continuing its efforts to limit the use of Chinese-made drones in the U.S. through executive orders, but faces significant challenges due to China's market dominance. Industry insiders and analysts note that Chinese firms, particularly DJI, are world leaders in the drone industry, making their products difficult to remove from global supply chains. A potential ban on these drones is expected to raise costs for commercial users in the U.S., as there are very few non-Chinese alternatives available. The policy reflects ongoing economic and technological tensions between the two countries, but its practical implementation could prove difficult and expensive for American businesses.

          <p>The UK's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, met with Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, as Western nations engage with the country's new Islamic-led government. The meeting comes after the fall of the Assad regime to rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a group proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK. Lammy stated that the UK is looking "to the future" and engaging with the new leadership to encourage stability, inclusivity, and accountability. The visit occurs amid concerns over recent violent attacks against minority groups and restrictions on social freedoms under the new government, which the UK says it will monitor closely.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning artists Tony Succar and his mother, Mimy Succar, have released a new cumbia song titled “La Brujería” in collaboration with the legendary Peruvian orchestra Armonía 10. The track is described as a playful musical dialogue where Mimy’s vocals offer a warning and the orchestra responds. Producer Tony Succar aimed to elevate Peruvian cumbia by blending it with other Latin American folk elements, such as the Colombian accordion. This collaboration marks a significant international debut for Armonía 10, an iconic band with a five-decade history that is considered a foundational pillar of the cumbia genre in Peru.</p>

          <p>Hamas has submitted a "positive response" to the latest proposal for a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange, stating it is ready to enter negotiations on implementation. The 60-day deal reportedly involves the release of 10 living hostages and the return of 15 bodies in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office quickly declared that the "changes Hamas are requesting" are "unacceptable to Israel." Despite this public stance, Israel has agreed to send a negotiating team to Qatar to continue the talks, indicating that diplomatic channels remain open even as major disagreements persist between the two sides.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees over an "inflammatory" sermon delivered shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The sermon included language that the regulator deemed divisive and not in the charity's best interests, such as a quote about Muslims fighting and killing Jews without proper context. The trustee, who was not a trained imam, was disqualified for three years. The commission stated that while the content came from a historical narration, its timing and lack of context were inappropriate, highlighting the need for charities to avoid stoking division.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas stated they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that struck on the 4th of July, as the disaster unfolded rapidly overnight while residents were asleep. Kerrville's mayor noted the Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Although a flash flood warning was issued, the sheer speed and magnitude of the event surpassed expectations. A Kerr County judge defended the lack of earlier evacuations, stating, "We didn't know this flood was coming," and explained that while floods are common, they had no reason to anticipate such a catastrophic event, which reached near-historic levels.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, performed 350 rescues on the Fourth of July holiday as dangerous surf conditions created powerful rip currents. In one dramatic incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than ten swimmers far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and aerial support from a police helicopter. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for much of Southern California's coastline through the holiday weekend. The event serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of ocean swimming, even for experienced beachgoers, when surf conditions are elevated.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has unilaterally paused a shipment of military aid to Ukraine, including critical air defense missiles, reportedly due to concerns over depleting U.S. weapon stockpiles. This marks the third time the administration has halted such aid, a decision President Trump defended by stating the need to ensure America has enough for itself. However, Democratic members of the House Armed Services Committee dispute the claim, stating that they have seen the numbers and there is no evidence of a weapons shortage that would justify the suspension.

          <p>England's aggressive, 'no draws' cricket philosophy, known as 'Bazball,' faces a critical test on the final day of their second Test against India. Needing an effectively impossible 536 runs to win, England's most realistic path to preserving their series lead is to bat for a draw, a strategy they have publicly disdained for years. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick hinted for the first time that the team might be flexible, acknowledging a draw is a possible result they would accept. The situation forces a potential strategic pivot for a team that has built its identity on relentlessly pursuing victory, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
