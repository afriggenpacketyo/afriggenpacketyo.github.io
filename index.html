          <h2>RFK Jr. Announces Plan to Eliminate Artificial Food Dyes in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:43:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year, citing studies linking these dyes to health conditions like ADHD, obesity, and cancer. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six others commonly found in cereals, ice cream, and snacks. This initiative follows previous efforts to ban Red No. 3 and aligns with actions taken by several states to restrict artificial dyes in school lunches, reflecting a growing concern over the potential health risks associated with these additives. The FDA is also planning to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:40:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the Bank of England will implement three more interest rate cuts this year, even as the UK faces higher-than-expected inflation, projected to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%. This forecast is attributed to rising energy and water bills. The IMF also downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.1% due to global fallout from US trade tariffs and increased borrowing costs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves responded by highlighting that the IMF still projects stronger UK economic growth compared to other major European countries in 2025, and she plans to advocate for fair trade in Washington.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Department of Defense to deploy additional combat-equipped forces to the Middle East, as U.S. forces conduct military strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen. Trump stated that the U.S. will continue striking Houthi targets until the group no longer poses a threat to navigation or U.S. personnel. The administration also sanctioned the International Bank of Yemen (IBY) for allegedly supporting Houthi terror operations, including oil purchases and weapons procurement. Trump warned Iran, the Houthis' chief backer, that it could be next if the attacks continue.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter results revealed sales and profit figures below analyst expectations, prompting investors to question CEO Elon Musk's focus on his role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Investors are concerned that Musk's involvement with DOGE, including cost-cutting measures and data access, has alienated consumers and negatively impacted Tesla's stock price. Analysts suggest that Tesla's association with the Trump administration has dampened demand for its vehicles, and they urge Musk to step back from his government role and return to focusing on Tesla's operations and strategic initiatives. The company cautioned that trade policy and political sentiment could impact demand in the near term.</p>

The lawmakers accused the Trump administration of intentionally targeting them to instill fear and of moving Öztürk to Louisiana to hand-pick a conservative court for her case.

          <p>Gold prices have surpassed $3,500 an ounce for the first time as investors seek safe-haven assets amid market turmoil triggered by President Donald Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump's criticisms pushed the dollar to a three-year low, while the IMF warned that Trump's tariffs have unleashed a "major negative shock" into the world economy, cutting growth forecasts for the US, UK, and global economies. Despite the market volatility, major European and US markets rebounded, driven by news that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects trade tensions with China to de-escalate. Concerns remain about the independence of the Federal Reserve and the potential implications for inflation.</p>

The Times corrected the article within 14 hours, and the former editorial page editor apologized for the error.

          <p>Canada has seen a record early voter turnout with 7.3 million ballots cast, representing a 25% increase from the previous election. This surge in early voting comes as Canadians prepare to elect their next government amidst an ongoing trade war with the US and President Donald Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state. Liberal leader Mark Carney has positioned his party as the best option to deal with Trump and his tariffs, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been campaigning in Toronto. The US has imposed tariffs on Canadian goods, impacting various sectors including the auto industry.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is implementing a password-sharing crackdown for its streaming service Max, similar to Netflix's approach. The company introduced a new "Extra Member Add-On" feature, allowing users to add an extra person outside their household to their subscription for $7.99 per month. This add-on provides the extra member with their own stand-alone account under the same subscription, including their watch history and recommendations. The move aims to boost revenue from direct-to-consumer platforms and sustain profitability, following similar strategies adopted by Netflix and Disney+.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is traveling to Washington to lobby the Trump administration to sign a proposed US-UK trade agreement. The agreement is reportedly ready to sign but faces potential disruption if President Trump imposes tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Reeves will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to push for a reduction in tariffs on UK steel, cars, and aluminum. The UK government is prepared to renegotiate the agreement if Trump proceeds with pharmaceutical tariffs, which are a significant UK export to the US. The IMF has cut the UK's growth forecast for this year, citing domestic factors and Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously mentioned during his presidential campaign. Economists, however, are skeptical of this proposal, citing it as unrealistic. Tariff negotiations are ongoing, with a 10% universal tariff rate on goods imported into the United States and tariffs on imports from China reaching as high as 145%. The potential changes to the income tax would require congressional legislation.</p>

The case centers on whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents when they require children to participate in instruction that violates their religious beliefs. The Trump administration is backing the parents, arguing that the board burdened their religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.</p>
