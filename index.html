            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that despite Vladimir Putin's declaration of an Easter ceasefire, Russian forces continued attempts to advance and inflict losses along the front lines. Zelenskyy cited reports of numerous shelling incidents and assaults by Russian units, contrasting the purported ceasefire with the ongoing military actions. Kyiv's proposal to extend the ceasefire remains, but Ukrainian forces will respond based on the ground situation. This news highlights the skepticism surrounding Russia's commitment to de-escalation amid the ongoing conflict. </p>

            <p>At WrestleMania 41, Seth Rollins emerged victorious in a main event match against CM Punk and Roman Reigns, largely due to a shocking betrayal by Paul Heyman.

            <p>Malaysian durian growers anticipate increased market share in China due to rising consumer demand for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Durian exports have surged this year, driven by consistent supply and improved logistics, particularly for fresh durians air-freighted within 48 hours. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are allowed to ripen naturally on the tree, a factor appealing to affluent Chinese consumers. This growth presents significant opportunities for Malaysian durian farmers to expand their presence in the Chinese market.</p>

            <p>In Medford, Oregon, the disappearance of Aaron Friar and his daughter Ellie led investigators to suspect foul play. Detective Bill Ford's interview with Russell Jones, a friend of Ellie's boyfriend, took an unexpected turn when Jones requested a cigarette. During a "smokin' and jokin'" break, Jones confessed to helping load Aaron's body and eventually led Ford to the location where the remains were dumped. This breakthrough led to the discovery of Aaron's body and further investigation into the circumstances of his death.</p>
