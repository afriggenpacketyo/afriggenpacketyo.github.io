          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois for 14 days, ruling there is no credible evidence of a rebellion and expressing concerns that such a deployment would likely incite civil unrest. This decision aligns with ongoing legal challenges, including a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals hearing regarding federal troop deployment in Portland, where state officials argue against the militarization of civilian law enforcement. The Department of Justice, appealing the Illinois ruling, maintains that cities like Chicago face "brazen hostility" towards federal officers, justifying the need for federal intervention. This legal conflict underscores a high-profile debate over the limits of presidential authority in domestic security matters.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment, secured by a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney, alleges James lied on a mortgage rider for a Norfolk, Virginia home, claiming it as a secondary residence while reportedly renting it out. James, who previously pursued a civil fraud case against President Trump, vehemently denies the "baseless" charges, calling them a "weaponization of our justice system" for political retribution. This development has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who view it as an attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants, fueled by strong performances from rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart and running back Cam Skattebo, delivered a stunning 34-17 defeat to the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. The game ignited controversy and backlash as the Eagles, inside the 10-yard line, ran the "tush push" play four straight times to score a touchdown, with critics like Micah Parsons and Dave Portnoy condemning its overuse. This marked the Eagles' second consecutive loss and Jalen Hurts' first interception of the season, while the Giants secured only their fourth victory against Philadelphia in their last 18 encounters, highlighting a significant upset.</p>

Known as "the woman with the German keys," her body was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar, wearing unusual clothing for a beach walk and carrying a key linked to Bottrop, Germany. This identification, made after two decades, marks the fourth success for the Interpol-coordinated initiative aimed at naming women who died in suspicious circumstances across Europe. The cause of her death remains unexplained, and police are continuing their investigation.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly declined to provide data or methodology to substantiate the administration's dramatic claims, prompting concerns from former FBI agents about the potential erosion of public trust in law enforcement. This discrepancy underscores a broader issue of credibility regarding government statistics in a highly politicized environment.</p>

          <p>UK universities have announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with further cost-saving measures potentially impacting an additional 3,000 positions, according to analysis from the University and College Union (UCU). This deepening financial crisis sees four in ten English universities in deficit, leading UCU members to prepare for potential UK-wide strike action over a 1.4% pay offer. The significant cuts are causing immense stress and uncertainty for academic staff, with some facing the end of their careers, and are also negatively affecting students through reduced support services and limited course options, highlighting a sector-wide challenge.</p>

          <p>Israel's government has approved the "first phase" of a 20-point Gaza peace plan, announced by President Trump, following intense indirect negotiations. This phase anticipates an immediate ceasefire, with Israel withdrawing troops to an agreed line, and Hamas releasing all living hostages within 72 hours, followed by the return of deceased hostages' remains. In exchange, Israel will release Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The agreement also mandates a significant increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza and the deployment of a multinational force to monitor the ceasefire. While a critical step, future phases involving demilitarization and governance remain subject to complex negotiations.</p>

          <p>Libby Adame, known as "the butt lady," has been convicted of second-degree murder after a second client, TV actor Cindyana Santangelo, died from silicone injections she illegally administered. This conviction follows a previous involuntary manslaughter conviction in 2024 for a similar fatal incident, which evidently did not stop her from continuing unauthorized cosmetic procedures. Prosecutors successfully argued that Adame was aware of the dangers, despite her defense claiming someone else performed the lethal Malibu injection. Adame now faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years for murder, underscoring the severe and often fatal risks associated with unapproved and unlicensed cosmetic enhancements.</p>

          <p>Biologists are ingeniously repurposing human heart-monitoring devices to gain unprecedented insights into stress levels among threatened animal species, significantly advancing conservation efforts. At the Smithsonian's Conservation Biology Institute, tiny Bluetooth monitors are implanted under the skin of animals, such as clouded leopards, to record vital data like body temperature, hydration, and heart rate. This "gigantic" leap, facilitated by Medtronic's donation of expired human devices, allows scientists to pinpoint moments of stress and understand factors that impede an animal's ability to thrive and breed. The data is crucial for assessing reintroduction candidates and mitigating human impacts on wild populations, offering powerful tools for species preservation.</p>

Schumer, joined by other prominent Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff, characterized the indictment as President Trump's latest attempt to weaponize federal agencies for political retribution against rivals. James had previously spearheaded a civil fraud case against Trump, which led to a substantial fine. Critics argue that these actions are "exceedingly dangerous" and fundamentally undermine the impartiality and integrity of the justice system.</p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, convicted of capital murder in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter Nikki, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, just one week before his scheduled lethal injection. His defense team maintains Roberson's innocence, arguing Nikki's death was misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome, with new medical expert testimony suggesting severe viral and bacterial pneumonia exacerbated by prescribed medications. The court's ruling mandates the trial court to re-evaluate Roberson's arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, which permits relief when evidence used for conviction is no longer credible, reflecting broader re-evaluations of shaken baby syndrome cases.</p>

This dolphin-sized marine reptile, dating back approximately 185 million years, represents the only known example of its kind and fills a significant gap in ichthyosaur evolution. Scientists observed several distinctive features, including a prong-like bone near its nostril and a long, sword-like snout. Intriguingly, marks on its skull suggest the "sword dragon" may have been killed by a bite from a much larger ichthyosaur, providing a glimpse into the dangerous ancient marine ecosystem.</p>
