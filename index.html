          <p>A shooting at Oglethorpe Mall in Savannah, Georgia, resulted in three individuals being injured by gunfire. The victims, identified as two young adults and one juvenile, are all expected to survive their injuries.

          <p>A coalition of former federal health officials has issued a stark warning about proposed funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the 2026 fiscal year. The proposed budget would slash the CDC's funding by over half, from $9.3 billion to $4.2 billion, which officials argue would have severe negative health impacts. They predict these cuts will cripple state and local health departments, which rely heavily on federal support, and dismantle successful programs for chronic disease, HIV, and injury prevention. The officials assert that these reductions will ultimately lead to more illness and unnecessary deaths among Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, seeking the authority to fire three members of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) appointed during the Biden era. This move follows lower court rulings that blocked their termination, arguing they can only be removed for neglect or malfeasance. The Justice Department's appeal contends that the officials have shown "hostility to the President's agenda" and created chaos within the agency. The administration argues this case is controlled by a recent Supreme Court precedent that upheld the president's authority to remove certain executive officers.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs guilty of two prostitution-related charges but acquitted him of the more severe charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. Following the verdict, Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs' request for bail, meaning he will remain in custody pending his sentencing, which is tentatively set for October 3. Prosecutors argued that Combs is a flight risk and has shown no remorse, while his defense team maintained he is a model prisoner who should be released. Each of the two counts he was convicted on carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claim that recent U.S. airstrikes have "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, setting it back by years. This assertion contradicts a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment which suggested a more modest setback of several months, a report Hegseth dismissed as uncoordinated and of "low confidence." The debate over the mission's effectiveness has become a political flashpoint. Iran, meanwhile, has retaliated with a missile attack on a U.S. base in Qatar, which officials say caused no injuries, and has also passed a law to suspend cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog.</p>

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli attacks on its nuclear facilities, Iran has passed a law to halt cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), raising concerns among nuclear proliferation experts. This move prevents independent verification of Iran's nuclear program, leaving the country to rebuild its infrastructure in secret. Some experts worry this could be a "fork-in-the-road" moment, potentially leading Tehran to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and pursue a more aggressive, clandestine path to obtaining nuclear weapons. The international community is left with uncertainty about the extent of the damage from the strikes and Iran's future intentions.</p>

As part of the agreement, he faces four consecutive life sentences without parole and waives his right to appeal.

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time for the first-degree murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared on Mother's Day 2020. The rearrest follows the 2024 release of an autopsy report on her remains, which were found in 2023, officially ruling her death a homicide. The report revealed the presence of drugs commonly used to tranquilize wildlife, which prosecutors allege Barry Morphew had access to and experience using. Initial murder charges against him were dropped in 2022 just before trial, but this new evidence has led to his rearrest and a $3 million cash-only bail.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that will impose a 20% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. from the Southeast Asian nation. In return, the agreement grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnamese markets. The deal also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the re-routing of Chinese products. This agreement comes as many other countries are still negotiating with the U.S. to avoid steep "reciprocal" tariffs set to take effect soon. (not investment advice)</p>

He noted that President Trump's new trade deal with Vietnam, which lowered a threatened tariff, caused a jump in the stocks of companies like Nike and Williams-Sonoma that manufacture there. Additionally, Cramer pointed out that the U.S. dollar has reached a four-year low. He suggested this weakness is beneficial for consumer packaged goods companies, as it makes their exported products more competitive globally. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that Kennedy's support for the bill, which could remove nearly 12 million people from health insurance, directly contradicts his stated life's mission to end the chronic-disease epidemic. It points out that Medicaid is a crucial tool for providing care to the sickest Americans and offers services that align with Kennedy's own "food is medicine" advocacy.

This could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in blue states, and jeopardize care for over 1.1 million patients.

          <p>Center Deandre Ayton has agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers after securing a contract buyout from the Portland Trail Blazers. Ayton, the former No. 1 overall draft pick, will fill a significant need for the Lakers at the center position, which was a weakness last season. He provides size, athleticism, and a lob threat to pair with the team's star playmakers. Ayton averaged 14.4 points and 10.2 rebounds for the Trail Blazers last season, though his playing time was limited by a calf injury.</p>
