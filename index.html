          <p>At least three people, including two children, were killed after torrential rain caused unprecedented flash flooding in Ruidoso, New Mexico. The Rio Ruidoso crested at a record 20 feet, five feet higher than the previous record, sweeping away homes and prompting dozens of swift-water rescues. The flooding was exacerbated by burn scars from wildfires last year, which made the landscape more susceptible to rapid water runoff. New Mexico's governor has declared an emergency to expedite federal aid for the devastated region.</p>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to a £100 million settlement to fund affordable housing, thereby avoiding a formal decision from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The regulator was investigating whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as pricing, which could have inflated home costs. While the firms do not admit wrongdoing, the agreement aims to resolve the case swiftly and provide a tangible benefit to the housing market. This resolution avoids a potentially long and complex legal battle over anti-competitive practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended fundamental reforms to the UK criminal justice system, including judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposals aim to tackle a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in the Crown Court, which causes years-long delays for victims and defendants. While supporters argue these 'dramatic' changes are necessary to prevent a total system collapse, some legal professionals express concern, viewing the jury system as a pivotal element of fair justice. The government is now considering the recommendations for potential legislation.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a 'pivotal moment' as an exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange continues, with over 200 firms leaving since 2016. The business group is calling for urgent action, including lighter regulation and tax incentives, to encourage investment in British companies rather than safer cash ISAs. The trend of firms listing elsewhere, particularly in the US, or being bought by private equity, threatens the UK's financial services sector, which contributes significantly to national tax revenue.

          <p>According to a report from the Kommersant newspaper, Russia has confiscated assets valued at around $50 billion over the last three years as it transitions to a 'fortress Russia' economic model. The seizures, which target both foreign and domestic assets, are often justified on grounds of strategic stability, corruption, or privatization violations. This large-scale nationalization reflects a significant shift away from the open, free-market economy envisioned after the Soviet Union's fall. The report suggests this trend is solidifying state control over the economy amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

The new claims, which Wallace denies, range from inappropriate sexual comments to groping and other unwanted touching. This follows his departure from the show last year amid an initial investigation and his subsequent sacking.

          <p>An opinion article from the Los Angeles Times argues that while Donald Trump had been making historic gains with Latino voters, his administration's aggressive and widespread immigration raids are now risking that support. The piece contrasts the potential political win of targeting recent arrivals with criminal records against the current reality of sweeping up long-term residents, which is generating fear and backlash within the community. The author draws a parallel to California's Proposition 187 in the 1990s, which alienated a generation of Latinos from the Republican party. The cruelty of the current approach, the article contends, is turning a potential political advantage into a liability.</p>

          <p>As the UK government proceeds with bringing privatized rail franchises back into state ownership, a new conflict is emerging over the future of 'open access' operators. These private companies, which compete with state-contracted services and assume all revenue risk, are credited with lowering fares and improving service on lines like the East Coast Main Line. However, the transport secretary has expressed concerns that they deprive state-run services of revenue and may not pay their full share of track access costs. This has sparked fears that the government may be seeking to limit competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to hydrologists, the deadly flash flood on the Guadalupe River in Central Texas was a known risk based on historical precedent for the area, known as 'Flash Flood Alley.' Experts at the West Gulf River Forecast Center recognized the potential for a major event, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a flash flood watch hours before the disaster. The region has a long history of catastrophic floods, with the river having reached similar or even higher levels multiple times. The overnight timing of the storm is cited as a key contributing factor to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers rookie phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered a stunning performance, striking out 12 batters over six innings to lead his team to a 3-1 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 23-year-old right-hander, making only his fifth MLB start, overwhelmed the Dodgers' lineup with a fastball that consistently topped 100 mph. The only run he allowed was a leadoff home run to Shohei Ohtani in the first inning. The loss marked the fifth in a row for the Dodgers, who were unable to generate any further offense against the rookie or the Brewers' bullpen.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled its intent to impose 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea, two key allies already impacted by existing duties on autos and steel. The move threatens to harm the export-dependent economies, both of which are already experiencing slow growth, with Japan potentially facing a technical recession. Automobiles are a top export to the U.S. for both nations, and the new tariffs could lower Japan's GDP and further slow South Korea's growth. While Trump indicated a willingness to negotiate, the letters are seen as a pressure tactic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four days after devastating flash floods struck Central Texas, at least 161 people are still reported missing in Kerr County alone, according to Governor Greg Abbott. The death toll from the disaster has risen to at least 109, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the Kerrville area. Among the missing are five children and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a summer camp located on the Guadalupe River. Search and rescue operations are ongoing with helicopters and drones, but officials acknowledge the scale of the destruction makes the effort incredibly difficult.</p>

          <p>In response to threats from U.S. President Donald Trump, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows, signaling unity within the BRICS economic bloc. Trump recently described the group—which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and others—as being set up to harm the U.S. and threatened a 10% tariff on any member nation. Trump has repeatedly attacked the bloc of emerging economies, which seeks to reform Western-dominated international institutions. This move by Brazil and India represents a direct counter to the U.S. administration's increasingly hostile posture. (not investment advice)</p>
