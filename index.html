          <p>President Donald Trump is standing by his claim that U.S. strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites, despite a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis suggesting the program was only set back by a few months. Trump addressed the controversy at the NATO summit, asserting that Israel is conducting its own report that will confirm the "total obliteration." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth supported Trump's statement, emphasizing the devastation caused by the 30,000-pound bombs. Democrats have criticized the administration's handling of the situation, with some expressing concerns about the accuracy of the claims.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is seen by some Democrats as a potential turning point for the party, offering a new, invigorated approach. Mamdani, a relatively unknown state assemblyman, ran a modern campaign embracing progressive ideas to upset former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Republicans are eager to use Mamdani as an example of Democrats moving too far to the left, while some Democrats worry about the implications of his socialist policies. Mamdani's focus on economic issues and ability to excite new voters is seen as a potential model for Democrats nationally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional lending practices. The directive instructs both housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. This decision aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of making the United States the crypto capital of the world.</p>

Googleâ€™s AI Overviews has already reduced traffic to outside websites by more than 34 percent, leading some publishers to prepare for a "Google Zero" scenario. Publishers are responding with legal action and licensing deals with AI companies, but the negotiating power is imbalanced, and the income from these arrangements may not be enough to save them.
