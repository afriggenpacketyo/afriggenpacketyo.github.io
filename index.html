Mangione has garnered support from individuals critical of the for-profit healthcare system, while Attorney General Pam Bondi sought the death penalty, linking it to President Trump's anti-crime agenda.

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an investigation into UC Berkeley regarding its disclosure of foreign funding, specifically focusing on potential undisclosed funding from China's Tsinghua University. This investigation follows Trump's executive orders emphasizing stricter enforcement of regulations requiring colleges to report foreign gifts and contracts exceeding $250,000. UC Berkeley denies the claims, stating cooperation with federal inquiries and emphasizing its terminated affiliation with the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute. The investigation is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to scrutinize universities' foreign financial ties, raising concerns about academic freedom and international collaboration.</p>

          <p>Border officers at Manchester Airport became suspicious of a couple's behavior with a baby, leading to the discovery that the child was not related to either adult. The couple, Raphael Ossai and Oluwakemi Olasanoye, were found to have conflicting birth certificates and ultimately pleaded guilty to immigration offenses. The little girl, named Lucy, was determined to have been born in Nigeria and given to an orphanage shortly after birth. The High Court is now trying to determine Lucy's true identity and what her future should be, as the Nigerian High Commission has not fully engaged with the case.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plea to Vladimir Putin to "STOP" the conflict in Ukraine is critiqued as insufficient, drawing comparisons to Joe Biden's similar approach. The article suggests Trump should emulate Ronald Reagan's firm stance and strategic communication with Russia, using both humor and clear consequences. It argues that placing too much emphasis on Putin's nuclear threats is a mistake, and Trump should leverage economic and military pressure to achieve a peace deal favorable to Ukraine. The author concludes by suggesting Trump threaten to increase oil sanctions or deploy nuclear-capable F-35s to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Tommy Pham has been suspended and fined by MLB for making a crude gesture towards fans at Angel Stadium. The incident occurred after a fan touched Pham on the back, leading to a verbal exchange and the offensive gesture. This is not the first time Pham has been involved in confrontations with fans, adding to a list of incidents throughout his career. Despite his on-field success, Pham's behavior has often drawn scrutiny and resulted in disciplinary action.</p>

          <p>A new analysis claims that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, has cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year, despite claiming to have saved $160 billion. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates these costs stem from putting federal employees on paid leave, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity. The White House disputes the analysis, but the PSP argues that the public will ultimately bear the cost through reduced services and economic losses. The IRS, planning significant workforce cuts, could forego billions in tax revenue due to decreased compliance and audits.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the pervasive influence of pornography on American culture, arguing that it has shaped attitudes towards sex, power, and relationships. The interview with Sophie Gilbert, author of an upcoming book on pop culture and girlhood, discusses how the mainstreaming of pornography has impacted women and contributed to regressive treatment in politics and media. While acknowledging the existence of ethical and empowering forms of sexual content, the article emphasizes the negative consequences of the dominance of regressive and cruel depictions of women in pornography.</p>
