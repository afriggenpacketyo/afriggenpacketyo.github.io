        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Democratic party is shifting its strategy to more aggressively combat Republican political maneuvers, particularly concerning gerrymandering ahead of midterm elections. Spurred by Republican efforts in states like Texas to redraw congressional maps, prominent Democrats are now advocating for retaliatory measures, a departure from their previous "when they go low, we go high" approach. Figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have declared their intent to fight fire with fire. This new, more pugnacious stance reflects a growing sentiment within the party that they must adopt tougher tactics to protect democracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several German cities have offered to accept and provide medical care for seriously ill or traumatized children from the Gaza Strip, but the initiative has stalled due to federal government reluctance. Officials from the Interior and Foreign Ministries cite security concerns and a preference for providing aid locally rather than facilitating evacuations. This hesitancy has drawn criticism, with some conservative politicians suggesting the offer is a political stunt for local elections. The debate highlights a deep conflict within Germany's ruling coalition over immigration policy, as other European nations like Italy and Spain have already begun accepting injured children from the region.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace deal negotiated without Ukraine's involvement would be a "dead solution." His comments come in response to a planned summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, fueling anxieties that Kyiv could be marginalized. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that Ukrainians will not surrender their land to occupiers. This defiant stance underscores the high stakes of the upcoming meeting, as Ukraine insists that a lasting peace can only be achieved with its direct participation.</p>

The deceased were identified as the suspected gunman, 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, and DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose. The incident, which occurred Friday evening, prompted a massive law enforcement response and a temporary shelter-in-place order for the campus. The gunman was found dead in a nearby building, though it is unclear if his death was self-inflicted or from police gunfire, and his motive remains under investigation.</p>

The New York City Police Department has taken a 17-year-old suspect into custody and recovered a gun from the scene, with an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting currently ongoing.</p>

In 2017, she founded the free ballet group Cinco Estrellas, offering classes to children in her community. Despite a competitive career in modeling, she considers herself a cultural ambassador, using the art form to empower a new generation and provide a positive outlet, much like it did for her during her childhood.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested more than 150 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest was organized to oppose the government's ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Many protesters displayed signs with the message, "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," leading to a significant number of arrests. The event highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism in the UK and the government's increasingly firm stance against certain groups.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who developed the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals three decades ago, has updated his guidance for today's retirees. In his new book, he argues that due to greater portfolio diversification, many retirees can now safely withdraw more, suggesting a rate of 4.7%. Bengen's refined strategy incorporates a wider range of assets, including small-company and international stocks, which he says increases the longevity of a nest egg. He notes that for today's retirees, a withdrawal rate closer to 5.25% or 5.5% might be appropriate, encouraging people to personalize their plans. (not investment advice)</p>

Growing up as the daughter of a famous anatomist and botanist, she had unique access to exotic specimens, which she depicted with scientific precision and artistic drama. Her paintings, often set against dark backgrounds, captured a complex interplay of life, decay, and the burgeoning global trade of the Dutch Golden Age.</p>

          <p>The traditional American shopping mall is experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, and even apartments. This strategy of subdividing large, empty retail spaces is helping malls increase foot traffic and create new "cross-shopping" opportunities. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold its former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of people who then patronize other mall businesses. Industry data suggests this mixed-use approach is helping enclosed malls recover from years of decline driven by e-commerce and changing consumer habits.</p>

          <p>China's national symbols, including giant pandas and the sport of table tennis, have become victims of toxic online fan culture. An article notes that some individuals have been manipulating public opinion to smear the country's "friendship ambassadors" and cyberbully panda caretakers. This behavior has led to legal consequences, with a court in Sichuan convicting two people for spreading false claims of panda abuse and inciting online harassment. The phenomenon reflects a growing problem where fan frenzy and emotional outbursts are directed at even the most revered national icons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing significant backlash over a proposal to roll back protections and expand oil and gas drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, the largest single tract of public land in the U.S. Conservation groups, Alaska Native communities, and the public have voiced strong opposition, fearing the plan threatens critical wildlife habitats, undermines subsistence rights, and accelerates climate change. The move is part of a broader push to industrialize the Alaskan Arctic, with critics arguing it erases years of work to protect the fragile ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Amid rising ticket prices for major concerts, a new survey reveals that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are using "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans to afford the cost. According to LendingTree, 23% of adults have used these installment plans for concert or festival expenses, with the figure rising to 37% for Gen Z. While BNPL offers a way to spread out payments, often without interest, financial analysts caution that these services may lack the consumer protections of credit cards. Instead, one analyst advises budgeting for entertainment by creating a dedicated savings fund.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey teenager's persistent and debilitating symptoms following a concussion led doctors to a surprising diagnosis of a rare brain condition. After months of severe headaches, dizziness, and memory issues, an MRI revealed that Logan Coleridge had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels. Doctors believe the AVM, not the concussion, was the root cause of his long-term symptoms. Following successful brain surgery to remove the malformation, Logan has made a full recovery and is now preparing to return to the football field.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco-based company, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing gold by repurposing neutrons during the nuclear fusion process. The idea is not to get rich from gold itself, but to generate a valuable byproduct that could offset the immense cost of developing commercial fusion energy. While scientists have previously turned other elements into gold on an atomic scale, the process has been prohibitively expensive. This new proposal, though still speculative, is considered clever by some physicists and represents an innovative approach to making clean fusion power economically viable.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark heat safety law, farmworkers are still succumbing to preventable heat-related illnesses and death, prompting accusations of failed enforcement. A recent state audit criticized the California Department of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) for understaffing and failing to take proper action in response to heat incidents. Advocates argue that many employers do not provide legally required water, shade, and breaks, while undocumented workers often fear retaliation for reporting unsafe conditions. The ongoing deaths highlight a systemic failure to protect one of the state's most vulnerable labor forces.</p>

Grimes, who died at age 79, had been ready to scale back her career in 1991 but stayed on to investigate why Soviet informants were being compromised. Her meticulous work scrutinizing financial records and activity logs led directly to the identification of Aldrich Ames, the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 after receiving millions for selling secrets to the Soviet Union.</p>

The firm believes the fast-growing, high-margin DAT business is a hidden gem whose value is being suppressed. By separating it, Carronade projects Viasat's total valuation could increase dramatically, potentially yielding a return of 76% to 304% for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

The article contends that measures like global tariffs, subsidy cuts for necessities, and reduced investment in scientific research are designed to raise prices, suppress consumption, and lower productivity. While degrowth is typically associated with environmental activists, the author asserts that Trumponomics, through its protectionist and atavistic approach, is steering the U.S. toward a future where Americans pay more and buy less.
