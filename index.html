          <h2>Appeals Court Temporarily Allows Trump Tariffs to Remain in Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 20:09:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily suspended a lower court's ruling that deemed President Trump's global tariffs illegal, allowing the tariffs to remain in place for now. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly challenged the president's authority and threatened ongoing trade negotiations. Small businesses and states had challenged the tariffs, which are central to Trump's economic agenda. The appeals court's decision does not address the broader questions of the case, and further litigation is scheduled for June 5; Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, indicated the White House will pursue tariffs through alternative methods if the appeal is unsuccessful. The case raises questions about the limits of presidential power regarding trade and economic policy. Optimism for business owners remains cautious as they seek more certainty about future tariffs. Optimism score is 55.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona. The decision came after one of the judges stepped down due to criticism surrounding her involvement in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor argued that the judge had violated judicial ethics by allowing a camera crew to film closed-door hearings for the series. The judges decided to retry the entire case, setting back all proceedings to March 11; the new judges will be selected by lottery. The case centers on allegations that Maradona's medical team failed to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death. The future timeline of the trial is now uncertain. The optimism score is 35.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician who helped expose Flint's water crisis, has created Rx Kids, a program providing cash to pregnant mothers in Flint, Michigan. The program gives every expectant mother $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 a month for up to a year after the baby is born. Dr. Hanna has raised over $100 million for the program, with 80% coming from private donors. Families are using the money for baby supplies, food, rent, utilities, transportation, and childcare, and Michigan State Senator John Damoose, a conservative Republican, supports the program for its efficiency and lack of bureaucracy. Since its launch, Rx Kids has distributed roughly $10 million to more than 2,200 families, demonstrating a model ready for national implementation. The optimism score is 85.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has accused Russia of deception for failing to present a peace settlement proposal ahead of potential talks between the two sides. A UN official stated that there is diminishing hope for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to produce a deal to halt fighting. Russia and Ukraine held a first round of direct talks on May 16 but failed to reach a ceasefire agreement. Russia has drafted a memorandum outlining its terms for settling the war, but Ukraine claims not to have received the proposal. The United States has urged Russia to take the deal for a ceasefire, stating that prolonging the war is not in anyone's best interest. The optimism score is 20.</p>

          <p>The cash reward has been increased to $50,000 per escapee for information leading to the arrest of the last two New Orleans jail escapees, Derrick Groves and Antoine Massey. Groves was convicted of murder, while Massey was held on domestic abuse charges prior to the jailbreak on May 16. Authorities believe the fugitives may have escaped Louisiana with assistance and may have altered their appearances; over 700 tips have been received, and several people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates. The inmates escaped by breaking through a wall and scaling an exterior wall, leaving taunting messages behind. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office has faced criticism for its handling of the escape, and the Louisiana Attorney General's Office is leading an investigation into the failures that allowed it to occur.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a warning against interfering with federal immigration enforcement operations after a demonstrator allegedly attempted to disrupt an ICE arrest in New York City. According to DHS, ICE agents contacted the Federal Protective Service (FPS) for assistance during arrests at a federal immigration court building. FPS officers witnessed protesters filming law enforcement, and one person attempted to forcibly interfere with ICE agents. The individual was briefly taken into custody and issued a U.S. district court violation notice; nearly two dozen anti-ICE protesters were also detained by the New York Police Department (NYPD) for blocking traffic.

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to an aggressive crypto crackdown, coinciding with efforts by the Trump administration to be seen as an ally to the industry. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, where WLF co-founder Zack Witkoff recently struck a deal with the government (not investment advice). The optimism score is 60.</p>
