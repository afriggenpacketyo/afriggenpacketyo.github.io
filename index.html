        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sports betting stocks experienced a downturn after Illinois legislators approved a budget that included a tax increase on online sports wagers, raising concerns among investors that other states might follow suit. The budget introduces a tax ranging from 25 to 50 cents per online sports bet, depending on the volume of wagers made during the fiscal year. Truist analyst Barry Jonas noted that this unexpected tax marks the second consecutive year of such measures in Illinois, potentially making it one of the highest rates in the country. The move has prompted speculation about whether other states will adopt similar strategies to address their budget deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift in consumer behavior coincides with ongoing economic anxieties, particularly in the wake of President Trump's tariff policies, which have raised recession fears and negatively impacted consumer sentiment.

          <p>Ukraine launched a drone attack on Russian military air bases, including some deep within Russian territory, which President Zelenskyy stated was secretly planned and coordinated from inside Russia over the past 18 months. While Russia acknowledged striking Ukrainian drone production sites, it did not directly respond to the Ukrainian strike, which reportedly damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bomber aircraft. This attack occurred just before the second round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, where Ukraine proposed a ceasefire and the return of Ukrainian children and civilian hostages. Despite the escalation, both sides agreed to a new prisoner exchange and discussed the possibility of a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case concerning a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that permits mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day. The central issue is whether the plaintiffs, including Rep. Michael Bost, have the legal standing to challenge state regulations regarding federal elections. Bost argues that the late-arriving ballot law dilutes the value of his vote and infringes on his rights under the First and 14th Amendments. The case could impact the ability of candidates to challenge state election laws in federal court.</p>

          <p>China has accused the Trump administration of undermining the temporary trade agreement established on May 12 by implementing AI chip export control guidelines, halting the sale of chip design software to China, and considering the revocation of Chinese student visas. China's Commerce Ministry stated that these actions "seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the trade dispute would be resolved during a conversation between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The markets experienced heightened volatility due to renewed concerns of a brewing trade war.</p>

Qatar's human rights record further complicates the victory, as the country is known for worker exploitation and restrictions on freedom of expression.

A survey indicated that a significant percentage of respondents would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, suggesting that Musk's political stances have impacted the brand.

Campbell suggests potential solutions include increased government funding, fees for fliers, and reducing the number of flights, but acknowledges the difficulty in implementing these changes.</p>
