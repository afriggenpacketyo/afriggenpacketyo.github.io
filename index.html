          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is confronting significant pressure from within his Labour party regarding his leadership and the recent dismissal of Peter Mandelson as the US ambassador. The sacking occurred after emails revealed Mandelson sent supportive messages to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Some Labour MPs are now openly questioning Starmer's authority, suggesting his leadership could be challenged if the party performs poorly in upcoming local elections. This internal dissent comes at a sensitive time, just as Starmer prepares to host US President Donald Trump for a state visit.</p>

          <p>European stock markets generally rose at the start of the trading week, with investors anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting on interest rates. In contrast, shares for Danish wind energy firm Orsted fell by over 5% after it announced a plan to raise new capital by issuing shares at a significant 67% discount. The market is also monitoring U.S. President Trump's state visit to the U.K. and key economic data releases, including the U.K.'s latest inflation figures. Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to implement an interest rate cut this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After being dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a group of climate experts is reviving the popular climate.gov website under a new, independent domain. The original government site was effectively dismantled by the Trump administration, which fired hundreds of staff and redirected the homepage, purging content related to diversity, equity, and disproportionate climate impacts. Led by its former manager, Rebecca Lindsey, the new non-profit site, climate.us, aims to restore all censored information and continue providing the public with trusted, timely data on climate change, free from political interference.</p>

          <p>A decade after consumer groups and trading standards officials first issued warnings, dangerous and illegal children's car seats are still being sold on major online marketplaces like eBay and Shein. These fabric seats, which failed safety tests spectacularly in 2014 by disintegrating in a 30 mph crash simulation, do not meet UK safety regulations requiring EU-approved R44 or R129 codes. Consumer advocates from Which? are urging parents to avoid these cheap but hazardous products, which can cost as little as £12.50. They are also calling for stricter regulations to hold online retailers accountable for preventing the sale of unsafe items.</p>

The partnership aims to boost energy security, create thousands of jobs, and attract billions in private investment for new nuclear technologies. Key projects include a plan by X-Energy and Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. The deal will also foster commercial collaboration, work towards ending reliance on Russian nuclear materials by 2028, and streamline safety certifications between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Despite falling to an 0-2 record, the New York Giants displayed a newfound competitiveness in a heartbreaking 43-40 overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a stellar performance with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, forming a strong connection with rookie receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late interception, their offensive firepower and fighting spirit marked a significant improvement from their season-opening defeat. The performance suggests that while the team's playoff chances are slim, they have become a more entertaining and promising team to watch.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that maternity services at fourteen NHS trusts in England will be investigated as part of a rapid review into systemic failures in care. The review, chaired by Baroness Amos, aims to understand why recommendations from previous inquiries have not led to lasting improvements and will pay special attention to poorer outcomes for Black and Asian families. While Health Secretary Wes Streeting praised the courage of bereaved families, some have criticized the review as inadequate and are calling for a full statutory public inquiry, arguing it fails to examine the role of NHS regulators.</p>

This shift is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors to seek better returns in the capital markets.

This warning comes as Aldi reported a drop in profits despite higher sales, attributing the decline to investments in price cuts and increased wages.

          <p>China is considering a proposal to repurpose its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced nuclear reactors, a project known as the C2N initiative. This strategy, put forward by a top state-owned energy firm, aims to accelerate decarbonization while preserving existing valuable infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, converting these sites could offer a direct path to clean energy. Researchers suggest that using these established locations may also help in meeting safety requirements and gaining public acceptance for new nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>A national climate risk assessment in Australia has issued a stark warning that rising oceans and coastal flooding will threaten the homes of over a million Australians by 2050. The report predicts that the country will face more frequent and extreme climate events, which will compound to pressure infrastructure, services, and public health, with a projected surge in heat-related fatalities. Climate Minister Chris Bowen stated that climate change is a current reality for Australians and that preventing every degree of warming is crucial for future generations.
