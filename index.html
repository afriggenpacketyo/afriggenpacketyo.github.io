          <p>China aims to include civil aviation, particularly the certification of the C919 aircraft, in discussions at the upcoming summit with European Union leaders in July, according to sources. High-level negotiations on safety evaluation could expedite the airliner's ratification, potentially influenced by a rumored large Airbus order from Beijing. The summit presents an opportunity for leaders to review progress and strengthen consensus at working levels to benefit real work. Direct talks between top leaders could be helpful for certification, and consensus can enhance and benefit real work, which would be seen as a win for China.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of unrest with fireworks and bottles thrown at police, resulting in 17 officer injuries. The violence followed a peaceful protest related to an alleged sexual assault, leading to the arrest of two teenage boys who deny the charges. The unrest, described as "racist thuggery," included cars set ablaze and property damage, prompting concerns about rising tensions and illegal immigration. Some residents displayed signs indicating nationalities of households, while politicians condemned the violence and called for calm, but the underlying tensions of the situation are unlikely to be resolved quickly.</p>

          <p>Asia is increasingly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committing to boost local currency use in trade and investment.

Investors and officials recognize the dollar's potential use as leverage in trade negotiations, leading to re-evaluation of U.S. dollar portfolios. De-dollarization is viewed as an ongoing, slow process, but is gaining momentum as Asian economies seek to reduce reliance on the greenback to reduce FX risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Inditex, the owner of Zara, experienced a drop of over 6% after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales, indicating a slower start to the summer season amid economic uncertainty. The Spanish retailer's revenues for the fiscal first quarter fell slightly short of analysts' forecasts, and net income also came in lower than estimated. The company reported slower growth in summer sales compared to the previous year, and the impact of tariffs on consumer spending remains unclear.

The eugenics law, in effect from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to sterilize people with disabilities without consent, affecting approximately 25,000 individuals.

          <h2>ICE Raids Impact Los Angeles Fashion District Businesses</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent ICE raids in Los Angeles' fashion district have left businesses struggling due to a decline in customers and workers, with some employees staying home out of fear. Business owners express concerns about paying rent and the overall economic impact on the area, which relies heavily on immigrant shoppers. One business owner said that demand had dropped 50% since the pandemic and an additional 20% after the ICE raid. A domino effect is occurring as businesses in the "callejones" are impacted, and their lack of customers leads to a decrease in wholesale purchases.</p>

          <h2>AI Upskilling May Be More Important Than College Degrees, Says Expert</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 02:15:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer report, employer demand for formal degrees is declining, especially in AI-exposed fields, as AI helps people rapidly build expert knowledge. Skills are changing 66% faster in occupations exposed to AI, such as financial analysts, compared to those least exposed. PwC Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson suggests upskilling on AI at home to adapt to the changing work landscape. The access to vast amounts of knowledge amplified by AI is leading to a new kind of economy where the bar for everyone goes higher.</p>

          <p>Two adaptations of Johann Sebastian Bach's St. John Passion explore contemporary issues, with "QueerPassion" addressing violence against LGBTQ+ people and "Arabian Passion" focusing on war and displacement in the Middle East. Thomas Höft's "QueerPassion" incorporates stories of queer individuals facing discrimination, while Vladimir Ivanoff's "Arabian Passion" integrates Arabic instruments and language to reflect the suffering of people in the Middle East. Both works will be performed at the Bachfest in Leipzig, fitting the festival's theme of "Transformation." These reinterpretations build on Bach's own practice of rewriting and adapting his cantatas, giving new context to the original work.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, identified as "Jane," testified about the rapper's life, including alleged drug use and sexual fantasies, during his federal trial for sex crimes. Attorney David Seltzer suggests that while Jane's testimony highlights Combs' morally reprehensible behavior, it doesn't necessarily prove the government's case. Former federal prosecutor Neahma Rahmani believes the case hinges on coercion versus consent, as Combs' lawyers suggest Jane chose to participate in the alleged events. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Combs facing charges including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.</p>

Mayor Karen Bass ordered the curfew in response to protests against the Trump administration's immigration raids, which had led to numerous arrests and property damage. Faith leaders led a march toward the federal building, advocating for nonviolent resistance, while law enforcement established a skirmish line and declared an unlawful assembly after the curfew went into effect.

Some prioritize support for young people, apprenticeships, and affordable housing, while others emphasize the need for better-paying jobs and adult education. Some residents earning more than 50,000 pounds call for more help with childcare, while others on low incomes stress the importance of welfare benefits and stable jobs. A GP suggests subsidizing fresh produce, while a pensioner advocates for government savings and efficiency improvements, but all share the hope that the government will address critical needs.</p>
