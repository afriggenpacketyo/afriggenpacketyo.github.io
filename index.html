          <p>Former New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis is defending the 2001 tackle that injured Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe and inadvertently launched Tom Brady's career. Lewis argues that Bledsoe, who had just signed a massive contract as a pocket passer, was responsible for the situation by choosing to scramble with the ball. The hit, which was legal, is often cited as a pivotal moment in NFL history, leading to Brady's two-decade dynasty. Lewis, who has largely avoided the spotlight since retiring, states the play is irrelevant to him personally, despite its historical significance and the frustration of being primarily remembered for that single event.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted dispute with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich reports that the city is owed $34 million for critical sewage and stormwater system upgrades, but FEMA has denied requests for increased funding to cover rising costs, creating a stalemate. This issue is not isolated, as CBS News found over 250 other Katrina relief projects in Louisiana and Mississippi remain incomplete. FEMA acknowledges the delays are unacceptable, citing bureaucratic issues and a shift towards empowering local communities for faster disaster response.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley played a role in igniting the 6,800-acre Pickett fire. The investigation is reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the blaze, which started on the winery's property. A spokesperson for Hundred Acre confirmed cooperation with the investigation but declined to comment on the ashes theory, stating only that no controlled burn occurred. The fire, which has threatened hundreds of buildings, is now 33% contained, with no structures reported destroyed, though the winery has sustained infrastructure damage.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is modifying its long-standing policy that offered guaranteed refunds for extra seats purchased by plus-size travelers, causing distress among advocates. Previously, the airline encouraged passengers needing more space to buy an extra seat and would refund the cost after travel. Under the new policy, a refund is only issued if the flight departs with at least one open seat, creating financial uncertainty for travelers. This change, part of a broader operational update as the airline moves to assigned seating, is seen by many in the plus-size community as a reversal of the airline's reputation for accessibility and compassion.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of video footage has determined that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday. The investigation identified two initial, nearly simultaneous strikes on separate staircases, followed by a later "double-tap" strike where two projectiles hit the same location milliseconds apart. The attack, which killed at least 20 people, has drawn international condemnation. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has not acknowledged carrying out more than one strike and stated an inquiry found Hamas was using a camera in the area, a claim that does not strip a hospital of its protected status under international law.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has fired a total of four employees following a protest and break-in at the office of company president Brad Smith. The demonstration was organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid' to demand Microsoft sever ties with Israel, following reports that the Israeli military uses the company's Azure cloud platform for surveillance of Palestinians. The protesters, who were arrested after occupying the executive's office, included current and former employees from Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. In response, Microsoft stated the terminations were due to serious violations of company policy and conduct that created significant safety concerns for other employees.</p>

Johnson, known as 'your girlfriend' to her listeners, continues this legacy by providing a platform for local experts to offer free advice on legal and medical issues.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a network of spammers, primarily based in Pakistan, who are using artificial intelligence to create and post fake images of Holocaust victims on Facebook. These low-quality, AI-generated images, or "AI slop," are paired with fabricated stories to drive high engagement, which is then monetized through Meta's content payment program. Holocaust memorial organizations have condemned the practice, stating it distresses survivors, disrespects victims, and dangerously distorts history. The investigation found that spammers game the system by creating viral content for high-value Western audiences and sometimes impersonate other entities to build their following before posting the fabricated historical content.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka has advanced to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory, demonstrating strong form just weeks after a controversial moment in Montreal. Following her loss in the Montreal final, Osaka was criticized for her runner-up speech, an event she says left her feeling shame and guilt. However, she has performed well in New York, winning eight of her last nine matches and showcasing improved movement and clean ball-striking. This marks a significant step in her comeback, as she aims to reach the fourth round of a major for the first time since winning the Australian Open in 2021.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 Rohingya refugees allege that Indian authorities forcibly deported them to war-torn Myanmar by abandoning them in the Andaman Sea. The refugees, who were living in Delhi, claim they were detained under false pretenses, flown to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and then taken onto a naval vessel. They testify that their hands were bound before they were forced into the sea with life jackets and told to swim to shore, which they later discovered was Myanmar. The UN's special rapporteur says there is significant evidence supporting these allegations, which represent a grave risk to the lives of the refugees fleeing persecution.</p>

          <p>During the recent mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, older middle school students are being hailed as heroes for protecting their younger peers. According to officials and parents, as gunfire erupted, many older students instinctively shielded younger children, with one taking a shotgun blast to the back to cover another child. This heroism was facilitated by the school's 'buddy system,' which pairs older students with younger ones for school events like Mass. While the community mourns the two children who were killed, the selfless actions of staff and students are credited with preventing an even greater loss of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An angler in Lake Huron discovered an enormous grass carp, one of the most destructive invasive fish species in the Great Lakes region. The specimen measured over four feet long and weighed 57 pounds, making it one of the largest ever processed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). Although this particular fish was sterile, the presence of even a single grass carp is alarming due to their voracious appetite for aquatic vegetation, which can destroy wetland habitats and harm native species. The DFO is conducting early detection surveys and has urged the public to report any sightings of the invasive fish immediately.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans indicates that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be a net negative for the brand's appeal. The poll found that 35% of consumers were less likely to buy a Tesla because of FSD, while only 14% said it made them more likely to purchase one. The report from Slingshot Strategies also revealed that nearly half of those surveyed believe the technology should be illegal, highlighting a significant public perception challenge for the automaker. This data emerges as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational issues, with Elon Musk continuing to assert that the company's future depends on autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America (VOA), without the approval of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. Judge Royce C. Lamberth stated that Lake's attempts to remove Abramowitz were a clear violation of the law designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. The ruling comes amid lawsuits against Lake's efforts to dismantle VOA, which has seen its workforce and original programming drastically reduced under her leadership. The judge rejected the administration's broad claims of executive power in this case, affirming the statute protecting VOA's journalistic independence.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, the complex relationship between China and Japan is highlighted by two concurrent phenomena: a blockbuster Chinese film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities and a surge in Chinese tourism to Japan. The film, 'Dead to Rights,' which portrays the 1937 Nanking massacre, has been a massive box office success, tapping into deep-seated historical trauma. Simultaneously, Japan has become the top tourist destination for Chinese visitors, with nearly a million traveling there in July alone. This paradox illustrates the enduring love-hate dynamic defined by historical wounds, geopolitical rivalry, and modern economic and cultural ties.</p>

A High Court injunction, currently under appeal, requires the 138 male asylum seekers to be moved out by September 12 due to planning law breaches. The man, who fled Somalia, described the hostility and intimidation from anti-immigration protests that have made residents afraid to leave the hotel. While critical of the behavior of some fellow residents, he also expressed an understanding of local frustrations regarding mass migration, highlighting the complex and tense situation.</p>
