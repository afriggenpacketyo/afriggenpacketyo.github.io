          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so and the first time such a warning included the city itself. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, impacted travel, including halting flights at Midway International Airport and causing backups on expressways. Residents described the event as something out of history books, with some pulling over on Interstate 55 due to near-zero visibility. The dust storm cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, including fighter jet escorts and opulent ceremonies. Trump secured over $2 trillion in economic investments between the United States and these nations, which are major purchasers of American military equipment. He praised the wealth and efficiency of his hosts, noting their ability to pay upfront for deals. The trip also served as a campaign-style rally, with Trump making familiar political statements to friendly audiences.</p>

          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods exported to the United States, their biggest market. Ginex, a local company, has stalled expansion plans due to uncertainty over the tariff rate, which could be as high as 35 percent. The tariffs threaten to disrupt a steady market for Gorazde's weapons factories, which have relied on American demand for guns since the collapse of Yugoslavia. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the United States has abandoned its faith in free trade as a path to peace.</p>

Over time, the children began to show signs of recovery, engaging in team sports and forming bonds with the staff.

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded sneakers a second life by collecting them from drop-off locations across the United States. The company sorts the shoes, sending reusable pairs to developing countries for resale and recycling unusable ones into foam, rubber, or textiles. This initiative reduces waste and creates microbusiness opportunities in developing countries, offering an environmentally friendly way to dispose of unwanted footwear.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in court that she would give back a $20 million settlement from Sean "Diddy" Combs if it meant she could undo the "humiliating" drug-fueled sex parties she allegedly endured. Ventura rejected the defense's suggestion that her accusations were financially motivated. She testified that she was coerced into the sessions, which involved male escorts, because Combs had threatened her with violence. Her testimony revealed graphic details about her sex life with the rapper and the physical violence she allegedly endured from him.</p>

The project involves developing a small rocket named Tianxing-1, which features lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability.
