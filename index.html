          <h2>Trump Announces Increased Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Imports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the US will double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% to boost the local steel industry and national supply while decreasing reliance on China. Trump also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between US Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel. Concerns from steelworkers about the US-Japan trade deal revolved around how Japan would honor workers' union contracts. While a union member expressed optimism, the tariffs have largely led to global economic chaos and worsened relations between the US and other countries. (not investment advice) The optimism score for this article is relatively neutral, considering both positive local impacts and negative global implications.</p>

          <p>China has launched the Tianwen-2 space probe to collect samples from the asteroid 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 KamoÊ»oalewa, near Mars. The 10-year plan includes the "Tianwen-3" Mars sampling return mission in 2028 and the "Tianwen-4" mission to Jupiter. The asteroids, chosen for their stable orbits, may offer clues about Earth's formation, such as the origins of water. NASA is restricted from cooperation with the CNSA due to the Wolf Amendment, preventing them from receiving any samples. China's continued space exploration efforts are giving them a step in the right direction to becoming a major force in space exploration.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, releasing the bees into the surrounding area. Authorities have warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarms, and roads have been closed as bee experts help with the cleanup. The plan is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee, with the goal of saving as many of the bees as possible. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, and this accident raises concerns about their well-being and the potential impact on agriculture.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officials are warning that drug dealers are using emojis on social media sites as code names for illicit drugs. An investigation in Lompoc, California, prompted authorities to break down the meaning of the emojis to help the public decode the transactions. Detectives found that a 15-year-old student was provided edible cannabis products by an adult who was using an Instagram account to sell drugs to underaged children. Officials are asking parents to review their children's social media accounts for suspicious activity and talk to them about the dangers of illegal drug activity.</p>

          <p>California Governor Newsom is proposing to reinstate an "asset test" for low-income and disabled Medi-Cal applicants, requiring them to prove their assets total less than $2,000. The proposal aims to tackle rising costs in the Medi-Cal and In-Home Supportive Services programs. Disability and health advocates are criticizing the proposal, arguing that it would result in people losing coverage and force older adults and people with disabilities into extreme poverty.

          <p>Elon Musk lashed out when asked about a New York Times report alleging his frequent use of ketamine during the 2024 campaign, during an Oval Office send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration. Musk has publicly stated he has a prescription for ketamine and uses it infrequently to manage a "depressive mindstate." The Oval Office back-and-forth occurred as Musk concluded his role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he aimed to cut federal spending. While Musk had predicted $1 trillion in savings, the administration says DOGE has saved about $170 billion so far.</p>

The review will recommend deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control unmanned weapons. New money for defense will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center has warned people to beware of websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices, as complaints related to such websites have spiked since March. Some consumers reported that the rice was never delivered despite payment, while others received unrelated items like sunglasses. The center advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid buying from websites selling rice at unrealistically low prices. The warning comes as the average price of rice at supermarkets has risen due to a poor harvest, hitting a record high in mid-May.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation, with higher prices impacting visitors. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported a decrease in visitors in March and April, and hotel occupancy has also slipped despite higher average nightly rates. The CEO of the LVCVA attributes the decline to a drop in consumer confidence and fewer international visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more. Some businesses report that customers are saying they will not return due to traffic and increased costs, indicating a potential shift in Las Vegas's appeal as a bargain vacation destination.</p>

Chaotic scenes have been reported at distribution centers, with desperate civilians trampling over barriers and reports of contractors using non-lethal deterrents.

The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, supports the call for recognition, noting the sport's long and proud history. A cross-party group of MPs suggests the lack of honors is due to the working-class backgrounds of rugby league players compared to the more middle-class roots of rugby union, which has received knighthoods for over a century.
