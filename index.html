          <p>A vehicle plowed into a crowd outside a Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning as patrons, mostly women, were waiting to enter the venue. The vehicle, a Nissan Versa, also struck a taco truck and a valet stand before stopping. Authorities are conducting a large-scale investigation, noting that one of the victims was also discovered to have a gunshot wound, though its connection to the crash is unclear.</p>

          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, posing a risk of flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions across all four nations. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized alerts remain active. The Met Office notes that the recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the flood risk. Further alerts are in place for the coming days.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a move to Barcelona, his preferred destination since falling out of favor with head coach Ruben Amorim. The proposed deal involves an initial loan with an option to buy, which would provide significant financial relief for Manchester United by removing his substantial salary from their wage bill. This would free up funds for the club to pursue other signings. Rashford has been training separately from the main squad amid the standoff over his future.</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods has initiated a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its "al fresco" brand sweet apple chicken sausage after receiving consumer complaints about finding white plastic pieces in the product.

          <p>A month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three of Iran's key nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, the full extent of the damage and associated safety risks remain unclear. The operation, which utilized powerful "bunker buster" bombs, aimed to disrupt Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities, which had been operating well beyond the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not detected increased radiation in the region, experts warn of potential chemical hazards from the release of uranium hexafluoride gas, which can be highly toxic.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a simple pulled muscle from working out was later diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. The diagnosis was unusual as she never had the typical warning sign of a mole on her skin. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining targeted radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has shown major improvement in her condition. Her doctors now consider her a "Stage IV miracle," and she is sharing her story to promote early screening.</p>

          <p>Over the 25 years since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), China's relationship with the continent has seen "leapfrog development." Chinese trade with Africa has increased nearly 30-fold, and its investment has grown almost 100-fold during this period. This economic partnership has been paralleled by a significant increase in security cooperation, with China now training approximately 2,000 African military officers annually and becoming a leading supplier of arms and armored vehicles to the continent, surpassing traditional partners like the US and Russia in some regions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques a New York City mayoral candidate's proposal for city-owned grocery stores designed to lower food prices for working-class residents. The author argues that the plan's core goal of affordability is fundamentally at odds with other policies championed by the candidate and his progressive allies. These conflicting policies include a near-doubling of the minimum wage, expanded worker benefits, and procurement standards prioritizing environmental and social goals over cost, all of which would inevitably drive up the operating costs of such stores.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao is returning to the ring at age 46 to challenge 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. After a four-year absence from competitive fighting, Pacquiao insists his passion and determination are as strong as ever, and he aims to become the second-oldest champion in boxing history. While critics question his ability to compete at this level after a long layoff, his trainer Freddie Roach states his power is still present, and Pacquiao is determined to prove he can still fight at the highest level.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is significantly reducing its Military Working Equid program, with plans to put 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as honor guards and pulling caissons at military funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, a tradition that will continue with a smaller contingent of animals. While the move is expected to save about $2 million annually, it marks the end of an era for many of these four-legged troopers, who are considered part of the Army's living heritage.</p>

          <p>The United States has taken a significant step toward regulating digital currencies with President Trump signing the "Genius Act" into law, which establishes new rules for stablecoins. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the House, marks a major policy shift after years of a hands-off approach and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry. While proponents believe it will foster innovation and cement U.S. financial dominance, critics worry the rules are too weak and will expose consumers and the financial system to greater risk.

          <p>With longer life expectancies, baby boomers planning to retire must ensure their savings can last for potentially 20 to 30 years. Financial experts suggest that a specific dollar amount is less important than planning based on individual needs and income. One common guideline is to have saved at least 10 to 12 times one's current annual income to account for inflation and longevity. Another approach is to plan for a retirement income that is a certain percentage of pre-retirement earnings, as living costs may change. (not investment advice)</p>
