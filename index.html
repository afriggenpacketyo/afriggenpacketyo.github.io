          <p>The UK economy demonstrated resilience by growing 0.7% in the first three months of 2025, surpassing analyst expectations. This growth was primarily fueled by the services sector and a significant increase in production, according to the Office for National Statistics. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves touted this as evidence of the UK's economic strength, critics pointed to downgraded growth forecasts from other financial bodies. The figures reflect economic activity just before tax increases and import tariffs took effect, leading analysts to caution that the growth rate may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Children in Kosovo with hearing impairments are struggling in schools due to inadequate resources and institutional support, leading to significant educational setbacks. Many parents, influenced by misconceptions, avoid teaching their children sign language, fearing it will hinder speech development. This lack of structured language support, combined with societal stigma and limited access to qualified interpreters, further isolates these children. While NGOs and dedicated teachers are working to improve the situation, the absence of sign language in the national curriculum and insufficient state support remain critical barriers to inclusive education.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that U.S. airlines faced a record number of passenger complaints in 2024, driven by flight cancellations, delays, and mishandled luggage. The surge in complaints began post-pandemic as airlines struggled to meet the increasing demand for air travel. Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints. New regulations mandating automatic refunds for canceled or significantly delayed flights aim to alleviate some customer frustrations, but air traffic controller shortages may further exacerbate scheduling issues in 2025.</p>

Experts explain that nature provides a break for the brain, promoting relaxation and emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery. The article emphasizes the importance of quality over quantity when spending time in nature and highlights the potential for a healthier relationship with the natural world.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has cautioned that their collective growth is at risk of slowing down significantly due to trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the previous year. This decline is attributed to tariff hikes, retaliatory measures, and non-tariff barriers, which are creating an unfavorable environment for trade and investment.

While direct impacts from U.S. tariffs are expected to be limited, heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty still pose risks to the outlook.

          <p>A charity established in memory of Diane Sindall, who was murdered in 1986, claims that the true identity of her killer was known by people on the Birkenhead estates. Peter Sullivan, who was acquitted of her murder after spending almost 40 years in prison, was allegedly not the actual perpetrator, according to local residents who approached the charity. However, these individuals were unwilling to provide names or evidence to the police due to fear of repercussions. Merseyside Police have issued an urgent appeal for anyone with suspicions about the crime to come forward.</p>

The decree also charges foreigners for access to public health care and education. Critics worry that the new rules will challenge Argentina's tradition of openness, while the government says it aims to guarantee the sustainability of public services.</p>
