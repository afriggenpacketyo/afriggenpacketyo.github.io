          <p>Following a period of heightened trade tensions, the United States and China have resumed communication, signaling potential progress in bilateral discussions. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau held a call to exchange views on crucial issues, building on earlier talks in Geneva where both sides agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. These statements reflect a mutual interest in stabilizing the relationship and maintaining engagement, further evidenced by Ma's conciliatory meeting with the new U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue. The resumption of dialogue offers a glimmer of hope for resolving ongoing trade disputes between the two nations.</p>

While President Cyril Ramaphosa aimed to discuss economic issues with the U.S., Trump focused on unsubstantiated claims of genocide against white farmers. The reactions highlight the deep-seated anger over the legacy of apartheid and the inequality that persists in South Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core consumer prices increased by 3.5% in April, the fastest pace in over two years, largely due to reduced government subsidies on utilities and rising rice prices. The core consumer price index has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Energy prices rose significantly, with electricity prices surging by 13.5%. Despite U.S. tariffs on Japanese products, their impact has been limited so far. Higher rice prices are expected to continue pushing up prices in the service sector, potentially influencing the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>The United States is imposing new sanctions on Sudan after determining that the country used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) last year. The sanctions include restrictions on US exports to Sudan and limits on financial borrowing. The Sudanese military and the RSF have previously been accused of war crimes during the conflict, which has resulted in over 150,000 deaths. The US is calling on the Sudanese government to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>

          <p>North Korea's newest warship sustained severe damage during a launch ceremony witnessed by leader Kim Jong Un, who expressed outrage over the incident. A malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the ship's stern to slide prematurely into the water, resulting in damage to the hull. Kim Jong Un labeled the event a criminal act, blaming it on carelessness and irresponsibility. Despite the setback, North Korea plans to repair the vessel by late June, though analysts doubt this timeline due to the extent of the damage and lack of necessary infrastructure.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing fear and confusion after the Trump administration revoked the university's permission to enroll them. The decision would transform a university where over a quarter of students come from other countries. Students are considering transferring to other universities, and programs are facing uncertainty. The move is seen as an attack on the student body and a disruption to campus life.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Relies on Obscure Lever to Stop Harvard's International Student Enrollment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 20:59:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is using an obscure bureaucratic lever to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, relying on the Department of Homeland Security's power over the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). By revoking Harvard's certification to access SEVIS, the administration is effectively halting the university's ability to manage and track international student enrollment. The move is seen as an escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to align with its agenda, with potential legal challenges expected from the university.</p>
