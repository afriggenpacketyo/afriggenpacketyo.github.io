          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 20:28:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents for their conduct related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, follow a critical Department of Homeland Security review which found the agency had become "bureaucratic, complacent, and static." The report highlighted a series of law enforcement failures that left Trump vulnerable during the campaign rally where a firefighter was killed. These disciplinary actions come as the agency grapples with heightened security needs following two separate attempts on Trump's life.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Randy Couture was airlifted to a Kansas City burn center after a severe crash during preparations for his National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) racing debut. He sustained first and second-degree burns, smoke inhalation, and other trauma injuries when his vehicle crashed and caught fire on the track. While his vehicle suffered major damage, Couture's injuries are not considered life-threatening. The 62-year-old MMA legend, who retired in 2011, had recently expressed excitement about embarking on a new competitive chapter in professional racing.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 120 fatalities, with Kerr County being the most severely affected, reporting 95 deaths, including 36 children. In response, President Trump has issued a disaster declaration, and Governor Greg Abbott has scheduled a special legislative session to address improving early warning systems. The tragedy has highlighted long-standing calls for better flood preparedness, as it was revealed that a contract for a new warning system in Kerr County was only recently approved and not yet implemented. Search and rescue operations are still active for over 170 missing individuals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to cut at least 2,145 senior and specialized positions at NASA through buyouts, early retirements, and deferred resignations. According to internal documents, the move aims to reduce the size of the federal government but would strip the agency of decades of experience, with most cuts affecting core mission areas like science and human space flight. Former NASA officials have condemned the proposed cuts, warning they threaten U.S. leadership in space exploration and cede ground to China's ambitious and well-funded program. The agency currently remains without a confirmed administrator.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all imports from Brazil, set to begin August 1, explicitly linking the move to the ongoing prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.

In response, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated his country would react with "reciprocity" under a new law authorizing proportional countermeasures.

Health officials attribute the resurgence to declining vaccination rates, as herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination level, while recent rates have fallen to around 91%.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for extensive layoffs across the federal workforce. The decision allows the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to significantly reduce the size of the government. A coalition of labor unions had successfully obtained the initial block, arguing the president overstepped his authority. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson criticized the court for greenlighting what she termed the president's "legally dubious actions" in an emergency posture, while the administration praised the ruling.</p>

The movie follows a Latino boy who feels alienated and dreams of leaving Earth, a theme the article connects to the experiences of Latino children amid aggressive ICE raids and anti-immigrant rhetoric. The piece suggests the film's box office struggles might be partially linked to a climate of fear that keeps Latino families, a key cinema audience, at home.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of all-inclusive family package holidays from the UK has risen sharply for popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey. According to data from TravelSupermarket, the average price for a week in Cyprus in August has increased by 23% compared to last year, while trips to the UAE saw a 26% jump. Travel industry experts attribute the price hikes to higher operational costs for hotels and airlines, including energy, food, and wages. To manage costs, some holidaymakers are now booking shorter trips or opting for mid-week travel, though some are also upgrading to more premium packages.</p>

These facilities are massive consumers of water and energy for cooling, raising environmental concerns. With the AI boom accelerating their construction, local activism is growing, with billions in projects being delayed or blocked nationwide due to the negative impacts on local communities and resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging its policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's and girls' sports violates Title IX. The complaint argues that the state's policy constitutes illegal sex discrimination by denying equal opportunities to female student athletes. Attorney General Pam Bondi referenced comments from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had previously called the situation "deeply unfair." This lawsuit is part of a broader national debate and follows a presidential executive order aimed at banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sports, a central theme of the 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has engineered its own custom hardware, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), specifically to cool Nvidia's next-generation GPUs. These powerful processors, which are driving the AI boom, generate immense heat and require sophisticated cooling solutions. Instead of building new data centers for liquid cooling, Amazon developed the IRHX to be integrated into existing facilities, allowing for faster deployment at scale. This move continues Amazon's strategy of creating its own infrastructure hardware, reducing reliance on third-party suppliers and improving the efficiency and profitability of its cloud division.</p>

PSG's midfield controlled the game completely, exposing a lack of structure and resistance from a Real Madrid side that appeared shapeless.

          <p>A Utah judge has scheduled a September 5 execution by firing squad for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old death row inmate diagnosed with dementia. Menzies was convicted for the 1986 abduction and murder of Maurine Hunsaker. His lawyers are appealing the decision, arguing his cognitive decline is so severe that he cannot rationally understand his punishment, a standard previously addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite this, the judge signed the death warrant, though a hearing to re-evaluate Menzies' competency is set for July 23. If it proceeds, it will be the sixth U.S. execution by firing squad since 1977.</p>

          <p>An article from The Economist examines the political challenge the Trump administration faces regarding conspiracy theories surrounding the late Jeffrey Epstein. Before taking office, some high-ranking officials fueled theories about a deep state cover-up of Epstein's connections. Now in power, the Department of Justice has stated there is no secret information to release, a declaration that tends to reinforce rather than dispel the beliefs of conspiracy theorists. The situation highlights a difficult paradox for the administration, as its official statements now contradict the prior rhetoric of some of its own members.</p>
