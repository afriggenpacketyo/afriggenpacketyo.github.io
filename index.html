        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, contesting the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, deeming it an "unprecedented power grab." The lawsuit argues that President Trump bypassed Governor Newsom by placing the troops under federal control without the governor's consent, which violates Section 12406. The state asserts that the deployment is unnecessary, stokes fear, and increases tensions, as local police are effectively managing protests related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta emphasizes that the President lacks the authority to deploy the National Guard under the cited circumstances. The article highlights Newsom's criticism of Trump's actions as inflammatory and his request to rescind the deployment. </p>

          <p>This article reflects on Operation Babylift, which evacuated over 2,500 children from Vietnam to the United States during the final days of the Vietnam War in April 1975. The operation aimed to rescue children fathered by U.S. servicemen amid fears of potential harm after the North's invasion of Saigon, yet faced criticism due to some children not being orphans and some being evacuated without parental consent. One evacuee, Thuy Williams, recounts her experience, including being pulled from the flight that crashed, and her subsequent adoption and successful life in the U.S. Steve Ford, son of then-President Gerald Ford, defends the mission, acknowledging its imperfections but emphasizing the moral imperative to save the children. The article also touches on the lasting impact on those who were airlifted, such as Williams who went on to excel in sports and serve in the Army.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom reports that President Trump plans to deploy an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, a move Newsom criticizes as reckless and disrespectful. Newsom, along with California's Attorney General, has sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the initial deployment of National Guard troops without the state's consent. The article also mentions the mobilization of 700 U.S. Marines to L.A. to support the National Guard, which is intended as a temporary measure. The American Civil Liberties Union condemned Trump's mobilization of the Marines, stating that they do not have the necessary training to police protests while respecting constitutional rights. The article also covers Trump's response, where he supported arresting Newsom for obstructing federal immigration enforcement action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, citing concerns about the politicization of research, interruptions in global collaboration, and budget cuts. The letter, called the Bethesda Declaration, urges NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to reverse delayed or terminated grants, allow work with foreign collaborators, and reinstate essential staff. NIH scientists expressed fears about speaking up but felt compelled to act, especially with Bhattacharya's upcoming Senate testimony on the proposed NIH budget. Bhattacharya responded that the declaration has some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions of the NIH, but that respectful dissent in science is productive.</p>

          <p>The girlfriend of Derrick Groves, one of the inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail, has been arrested for allegedly aiding in his escape. Darriana Burton, a former correctional employee, is accused of being actively involved in the planning phase of the escape, including relaying escape-related information and coordinating communications between Groves and people outside the jail. The Louisiana Attorney General's Office stated that Burton and Groves had an on-again, off-again relationship for three years. The reward for the arrest of Groves and another inmate still at large has increased to $50,000, as authorities believe they are closing in on the fugitives. </p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice after the DOJ demanded that the state's public high schools confirm they will bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. The state argues that the DOJ has no right to make such a demand and defends its laws allowing athletes to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. The lawsuit states that the state's bylaws do not discriminate based on biological sex and that allowing athletic participation consistent with studentsâ€™ gender identity is substantially related to the government interests of affording all students the benefits of an inclusive school environment. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said that public school districts must certify in writing that they will not abide by the California Interscholastic Federationâ€™s gender identity rules.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed Â£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant project, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision" for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband envisioned a "golden age of clean energy abundance." The project, however, faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe the investment is a costly mistake that will increase consumer bills. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for low-carbon energy security, but the project is expected to take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are in a heated dispute over protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles, with each framing the situation politically. Trump suggested that his border czar should arrest Newsom, prompting Newsom to accuse Trump of authoritarianism. Trump has criticized Democratic leaders in California, while Newsom accuses the White House of exploiting the situation for political gain. The White House responded by criticizing Newsom's leadership and accusing him of prioritizing political points over public safety.</p>

          <p>China's electric car industry is rapidly expanding, with companies like BYD becoming major players in global markets, sparking concerns among established manufacturers and governments. Chinese firms benefit from low labor costs, government subsidies, and a well-established supply chain, leading to competitive pricing. However, concerns have been raised about potential security risks, spyware, and hacking vulnerabilities in internet-enabled vehicles. While the US has imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable electric cars. </p>
