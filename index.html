          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally authored text messages detailing military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if other staffers were involved. The inquiry extends to whether any staff members were instructed to delete these messages. The details were shared in two Signal chat groups, one including Vice President JD Vance and other officials, and another including Hegseth's wife. The investigation seeks to determine if the information was classified and who wrote it, as well as whether deletion requests were made, considering the legal requirement to retain federal communications as official records.</p>

Restoring the police recruits will require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year, with costs growing to approximately $60 million in 2026-27.

These initiatives aim to symbolically recognize and heal historical injustices, with some providing financial support to affected groups.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance characterized Elon Musk's recent attacks on President Trump as a "huge mistake" but attempted to minimize the severity of the conflict. Vance described Musk as an "emotional guy" who became frustrated, despite the billionaire's critical social media posts. Vance expressed hope that Musk would eventually "come back into the fold," while defending Trump against allegations related to Jeffrey Epstein. Vance also defended the bill that sparked Musk's criticism, emphasizing its goal of extending the 2017 tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive black hole jet, Quasar J1601+3102, that is three times larger than the Milky Way, spanning nearly 200,000 light-years. The jet is estimated to be 1.2 billion years old and is powered by a black hole believed to have flared out in the early universe. The discovery was made possible by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), which allows astronomers to track both bright and low-frequency sections of the jet. Despite its size, the black hole is not as massive as expected, suggesting the potential for more undiscovered quasars of this type.</p>
