          <p>The future of Voice of America (VOA) appears grim after an appeals court order dashed hopes of staving off its near-total dismantlement by the Trump administration. The administration, led by Kari Lake, has laid off hundreds of contract employees and put permanent workers on indefinite leave. A district court judge had ordered the agency to bring back workers, but the appeals court froze that ruling. Lake's guidance has included killing a lease for a new headquarters and canceling contracts with news services. </p>

The shooter, allegedly motivated by pro-Palestinian ideology, committed an act of violence that has been widely condemned. The incident may shift the focus away from the conflict in Gaza and lead to a crackdown on the pro-Palestine movement in the U.S., making it less likely that the Trump administration will confront Israel. </p>
