          <p>A group of 59 white South Africans, claiming racial discrimination, have arrived in the US under an expedited refugee program, prompting criticism from immigrant rights activists and debate over the validity of their claims. President Trump stated that their applications were fast-tracked due to a "genocide" targeting white farmers, a claim disputed by the South African government, which denies any persecution. The US has also criticized South Africa's land reform policies, which aim to address racial inequality. This initiative has strained bilateral relations between the US and South Africa, raising questions about fairness and historical context.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) attempted to intervene in the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) shortly after President Trump tried to remove three CPB board members. DOGE sought to assign a team to review CPB's operations, but CPB leaders rejected the request, citing federal law that establishes the independent nonprofit outside of government control. This action is part of a broader assault by the president against public broadcasters like PBS and NPR, including an executive order to end federal funding, leading to a lawsuit by CPB challenging Trump's actions. The CPB maintains that it is not subject to the president's authority.</p>

While conservatives argue they are providing choice, many American families need two incomes to survive, and the proposed legislation may not be sufficient to support a single-income household.

          <p>Donald Trump’s Hollywood ambassadors, including Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, joined labor unions and major studios in asking the US president to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions. In a letter addressed to Trump, the studios and unions thanked him for supporting the industry through their “shared goal” of domestic production. The letter calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill being drafted by Congress that it argues would “immediately make America more competitive, expand the American media industry, brings jobs back to America, and support the independent spirit of American business”.</p>

          <p>President Trump invoked the golfing great Sam Snead to justify a plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar to use as Air Force One, comparing it to accepting a "gimme" in golf. He said that only a “stupid person” would turn down such an offer, dismissing ethical concerns as overblown. The decision underscores Trump's view of the world as a golf course, where only a fool would refuse an advantage, regardless of ethical implications.</p>

After weekend talks in Switzerland, both sides agreed Monday to lower tariffs for 90 days, with US tariffs reduced to 30% and Chinese tariffs to 10%.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at reducing high prescription drug prices in the US by ensuring that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in "unreasonable or discriminatory" price hikes for Americans. The order also proposes that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status – meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers. Experts are skeptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect. The order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.</p>

Customs duties were 86% above March and more than double the amount from a year ago, driven by President Trump's trade war. The influx in tariffs helped to cut the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.05 trillion, though high interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden. While the US is still running a massive budget deficit, the influx in tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance for April, a month in which the Treasury generally runs a surplus because of the income tax filing deadline hitting mid-month.</p>

Experts argue the problem is structural, not behavioral, making it harder for young people to save for markers of the American Dream compared to previous generations.
