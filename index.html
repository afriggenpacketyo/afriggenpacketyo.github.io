          <p>Tucker Carlson, a prominent voice on the right, has been advocating for the United States to avoid involvement in Israel's conflict with Iran, challenging the Republican Party's traditional hawkish stance. However, President Trump criticized Carlson's views, signaling a potential shift in his administration's approach. This disagreement highlights a growing tension between the "America First" faction, which includes Carlson, and those who support a more interventionist foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions, and Trump seems to be siding with the latter. This divergence raises questions about the future influence of the "America First" movement within the Republican Party, as Trump appears inclined to pursue a more assertive role on the global stage. The article discusses the implications of this shift, especially concerning potential military action against Iran. Optimism remains low as the situation develops.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested by masked federal agents while observing immigration court hearings and escorting an immigrant with a dismissed case. Video footage shows Lander questioning the agents' authority and requesting a judicial warrant before being handcuffed and detained.

He received styling help from a neighbor and surprised the contest organizers by showing up without pre-registering.

While the probability of a recession in the next year has decreased to 38%, it remains above January's 23% level. The survey indicates expectations for two rate reductions this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end, but only one cut next year. A majority of respondents expect the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China within about five months, but concerns persist about the inflationary impact of tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a warning to Iranian leader Ali Khamenei, calling him an "easy target" and demanding "unconditional surrender" in the conflict against Israel. This threat follows reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate the ayatollah, though Netanyahu downplayed any disagreement. Trump's comments suggest a potential shift towards direct U.S. military intervention as he backs Israel's efforts to pressure Tehran. Trump is scheduled to meet with his national security advisors to discuss the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Annual financial disclosures for Supreme Court justices reveal income and gifts received in 2024, with Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch, and Ketanji Brown Jackson earning money from books. Jackson made $2 million from her memoir, while Sotomayor and Gorsuch earned royalties. Clarence Thomas reported no gifts or outside income, while other justices disclosed teaching positions at various universities. The disclosures have received heightened attention since revelations of luxury trips accepted by Thomas from Harlan Crow, leading to calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan police officer was arrested for shooting an unarmed civilian during a protest in Nairobi against the death of blogger Albert Ojwang in police custody. The incident, captured on video by DW, shows the officer shooting the man in the head at close range. Protesters accused police of siding with attackers who assaulted them during the demonstration. Ojwang's death, initially attributed to hitting his head against a cell wall, was later revealed to be caused by assault, leading to broader concerns about police brutality in Kenya.</p>
