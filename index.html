          <p>Senate Republican Leader John Thune is determined to pass President Trump's megabill, despite opposition from within his own party and criticism from Elon Musk. The bill extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security, but also includes cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $3 trillion to the deficit. House Republicans from blue states are also threatening to derail the bill over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will visit China after a phone conversation with President Xi Jinping, the first since the beginning of a trade war between the two nations. Trump stated that he extended a reciprocal invitation to Xi to visit the White House, though the Chinese readout of the conversation only mentioned the invitation to China. The call, which lasted an hour and a half, primarily focused on trade and resulted in a positive conclusion for both countries, according to Trump. Both sides have accused each other of breaching a recent trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs.</p>
