          <p>Veteran actor Michael Madsen, celebrated for his memorable roles in Quentin Tarantino films like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Kill Bill," has passed away at age 67. His publicist confirmed he was found unresponsive at his Malibu home, with the cause believed to be cardiac arrest. Madsen's career spanned over 300 films, and he was known for often playing tough, charismatic characters. The actor, who had recently faced personal tragedy with the loss of his son, was reportedly looking forward to a new chapter in his life, including the release of a new book of poetry.</p>

          <p>A new study led by University of London researcher Michael Spagat estimates that over 80,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between October 2023 and January 2025, a figure 40% higher than the Gazan Ministry of Health's tally. The research, conducted independently through household surveys, suggests the ministry's figures are a conservative minimum rather than an exaggeration. The study also identified over 8,500 "indirect" deaths from disease and malnutrition. Researchers noted the war has killed approximately 4% of Gaza's population, potentially the highest percentage for any conflict in the 21st century.</p>

          <p>Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan are under significant strain following a series of escalating incidents, including a controversial police raid in Yekaterinburg that resulted in the deaths of two ethnic Azeri men. Baku responded by cancelling cultural events and arresting Russian journalists, while Moscow downplayed the event. The tension builds on lingering anger from the December 2024 downing of an Azerbaijani plane by a Russian missile. Analysts suggest Azerbaijan is asserting a more independent stance, potentially jeopardizing economic cooperation and signaling a decline in Russia's influence in the Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from former State Department diplomats criticizes Secretary of State Marco Rubio for proposals that would shutter most of the department's human rights offices. The authors argue this move dismantles decades of bipartisan foreign policy infrastructure and undermines America's global standing on human rights and justice. They contend that by framing human rights as "western values" and eliminating key policy roles, the administration is sending a dangerous message to both allies and adversaries. The piece urges Congress to intervene and protect the critical work of these specialized bureaus, warning that a retreat from human rights abroad could foreshadow repression at home.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has been eliminated from Wimbledon in a surprising second-round loss to 36-year-old Croatian Marin Cilic. The fourth-seeded Draper, considered a strong contender for the title, fell in four sets, continuing his struggle to advance past the second round at the All England Club. Cilic, a former Wimbledon finalist now ranked 83rd, dominated the first two sets with a powerful serve and deep returns. Despite a third-set rally from Draper, Cilic regained control to secure the victory, marking a significant disappointment for the home crowd's favorite.</p>

          <p>Following settlements with Meta and X, Google's parent company Alphabet may be the next tech giant to settle a lawsuit with President Trump. The 2021 suit alleges illegal censorship for restricting Trump's accounts after the January 6 Capitol attack. Court filings indicate "productive discussions" are underway between the two parties. Legal observers note the irony of Trump using the power of his office to pressure companies into settling a case that itself alleges companies caved to political pressure. This situation highlights a pattern where Trump has leveraged his presidency to pursue legal and political grievances against private companies and media outlets.</p>

In response, England's top order collapsed, finishing the day at a precarious 77-3. Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope were dismissed on consecutive deliveries, followed shortly by Zak Crawley, leaving India firmly in control.

          <p>President Trump has secured his first major legislative win of his second term with the passage of his sprawling tax and spending bill, but the victory may contain the seeds of future political trouble. The legislation delivers on key campaign promises by cutting taxes and increasing defense and border security funding. However, it is projected to add over $3 trillion to the national debt and will cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose Medicaid coverage. Democrats are already preparing to attack Republicans over the cuts to social services, setting the stage for a major political battle ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite slower economic growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw continued cuts. Despite the strong report, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, citing potential impacts from tariffs, which may lead the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts.

Although the State Department described it as a one-off event, the move comes at a critical time as Russia ramps up attacks. The pause underscores Ukraine's vulnerability and has prompted European allies to increase their own support and investment in Ukraine's domestic defense industry.

Conversely, it ends long-standing investment and production tax credits for solar and wind power projects that enter service after 2027.

This downward trend provides a potential opening for homebuyers in a market with persistently high prices. Experts note that while the Federal Reserve may not cut its benchmark rate in July, a cut is anticipated in September, which could further influence mortgage rates. For current homebuyers, this period presents an opportunity to check their credit, research real estate agents, and secure mortgage pre-approval to be better positioned if the market becomes more competitive.

The review notes that the film is most compelling when it shows Matsuhisa's meticulous demand for quality or investor Robert De Niro's concerns about rapid expansion. However, it often resembles a gentle chronology of a humble man's rise, rather than a deep exploration of his revolutionary impact on high-end dining.

          <p>Austria has deported a Syrian man convicted of a crime, marking the first such removal to Syria by a European Union nation since the country's civil war began over 15 years ago. The Austrian Interior Ministry stated the deportation sends an important signal about its strict asylum policy. The move comes after Austria and Germany deemed parts of Syria safe for return following the fall of the Assad regime. However, human rights groups have criticized the decision, expressing concern that the situation in Syria under its new Islamist government is still unstable and that the move could set a precedent for other countries.</p>

          <p>A 37-year-old Ph.D. student and U.S. citizen is suing Department of Homeland Security agencies for $1 million after he was arrested while filming an ICE raid at a Home Depot. Job Garcia alleges he was tackled, detained for over 24 hours, and suffered physical and emotional injury despite repeatedly asserting his citizenship. His legal representatives from MALDEF argue the arrest was unlawful and based on his race and his efforts to document government actions. The incident occurs amid a nationwide escalation of immigration arrests, particularly at locations like Home Depot where day laborers gather for work.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's major legislative bill disproportionately benefit the wealthiest U.S. households, particularly in states with no personal income tax. The top 1% of households in states like Wyoming, Texas, and South Dakota are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. This is largely because the bill extends many 2017 tax cuts favoring high earners and business owners, while its cap on state and local tax deductions has less impact in these low-tax states.

          <p>President Trump's massive tax-and-spend bill, while a major legislative victory, is deeply unpopular with the American public and could spell trouble for the Republican party. This article argues that large, partisan bills passed via budget reconciliation historically lead to a backlash against the governing party in subsequent elections. The process tends to highlight partisan conflict, and public support for such legislation often erodes as details emerge. Given that polling shows majorities disapprove of the bill's cuts to Medicaid and its enormous addition to the national debt, history suggests the GOP may be punished by voters in the midterms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed 887-page bill introduces sweeping changes across the U.S. economy and social safety net. Its largest budgetary impact comes from making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent, while also adding new deductions for tip and overtime income. To partially offset these costs, the bill enacts significant cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which could leave millions without coverage or assistance. It also directs major new spending toward immigration enforcement and the military, while repealing many of Biden's clean energy incentives, particularly targeting the solar and wind industries.</p>
