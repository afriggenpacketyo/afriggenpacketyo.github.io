          <h2>Death of California Fertility Clinic Bombing Co-conspirator Raises Questions about L.A. Detention Center</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 18:12:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The death of Daniel Park, the Washington state man accused of conspiring to bomb a fertility clinic in California, is being investigated as a suicide, according to Park's former defense attorney.\n\nPeter Hardin, a defense attorney who was representing Park, told CBS News that Park's parents "were able to locate and recover Daniel's body" but his family has not been notified about an official cause of death. As Park's death in federal custody is being investigated as a possible death by suicide, other attorneys have raised questions about the L.A. lockup.\n\nA U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesperson declined to answer questions about the investigation of Park's death.\n\nPark had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13. His death at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles was confirmed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons on June 24, but authorities have not disclosed the cause. The death of the 32-year-old has shuttered the federal criminal prosecution and thickens the cloud of mystery surrounding the May 17 bombing attack at the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California.\n\nThe alleged bomber and Park's alleged co-conspirator, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, was killed in the bombing, the FBI said. Four people were injured in the explosion.\n\nPark was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to be used by Bartkus. He was charged with Attempting to Provide Material Support to Terrorists, Conspiracy to manufacture unregistered destructive devices and aiding and abetting the manufacture of unregistered destructive devices.\n\nProsecutors alleged Park and Bartkus shared extremist views. In a charging document, the Justice Department said, "Bartkus's attack was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best."\n\nAkil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said Bartkus had "nihilistic ideations" and investigators believe he was attempting to livestream the bombing.\n\nPark's death closes the only prosecution in the fertility clinic bombing. It also comes amid questions about the conditions at the L.A. Metropolitan Detention Center. The prison is where people charged with a crime are held prior to and during court proceedings. It also holds those serving short sentences.\n\nImmigration lawyers in California told CBS News last month that they have been receiving increasing calls about unmet medical needs at the detention center. One lawyer, who chose not to identify herself because she has clients inside the detention center, said there are reports of "inhumane" conditions, including food shortages, cramped confinement, freezing temperatures and environments that are a "ticking-time bomb."\n\nA 2024 report by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the Bureau of Prisons' response to inmate emergencies.\n\n"We found significant shortcomings in BOP staff's emergency responses to nearly half of the inmate deaths we reviewed," the report said. "These shortcomings ranged from a lack of urgency in responding, failure to bring or use appropriate emergency equipment, unclear radio communications, and issues with naloxone administration in opioid overdose cases."\n\nResponding to the inspector general's findings, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told CBS News: "Any unexpected death of an inmate is tragic.\n\n"As noted in the Inspector General's report, we have already taken many steps to mitigate these deaths, and we welcome Inspector General's recommendations as a way to further our efforts. We will continue to work with the Office of Inspector General," the spokesperson said.</p>

          <p>The death of Daniel Park, a man accused of conspiring to bomb a California fertility clinic, is being investigated as a suicide, prompting questions about the conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park's death in federal custody closes the only prosecution in the bombing case, which injured four people and killed the alleged bomber. Attorneys have raised concerns about the L.A. lockup, citing reports of inhumane conditions and unmet medical needs at the facility.</p>

The majority of deaths occurred in Kerr County, where a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely impacted, leaving multiple campers and a counselor missing. In response to the historic flooding of the Guadalupe River, which rose with unprecedented speed, President Trump has signed a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance for the ongoing, large-scale search and rescue operations.</p>

First signed in 1979, the agreement has fostered crucial collaboration but is now politically sensitive amid a climate of geopolitical competition and techno-nationalism. Simon argues that the future of the STA is a bellwether for the broader U.S.-China relationship, balancing the promise of scientific progress against national security and intellectual property concerns.</p>

          <p>During a broadcast of "Face the Nation," White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett and Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi presented opposing views on the new tax and spending law. Hassett defended the bill, arguing its economic growth projections would offset deficit concerns and that fears of mass Medicaid coverage loss were unfounded. Conversely, Suozzi criticized the legislation as a "big, ugly bill" that would inflate the deficit, raise interest rates, and harm vulnerable Americans by cutting healthcare and food assistance while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.

          <p>A provision within President Trump's newly signed "megabill" is being described by critics as a significant blow to reproductive rights, as it bars Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. Experts warn this will have a devastating impact beyond abortion services, affecting access to basic healthcare like vaccinations and prenatal care for low-income communities. Reproductive rights activists argue that such measures represent a coordinated effort to restrict healthcare access in increasingly creative and sinister ways, making once-shocking stories of care denial dangerously commonplace.</p>
