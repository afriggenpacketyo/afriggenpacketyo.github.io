After a grueling match where CM Punk defeated Gunther for the title, Seth Rollins made a surprise appearance. Rollins, who was not expected to be medically cleared, cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat the exhausted Punk and capture the championship. The event also saw other title changes and high-profile matches, leaving the audience surprised by the dramatic outcomes.</p>

          <p>Over three decades after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, causing enduring pain for the victims' families and the investigators involved. The 1991 crime led to a complex investigation, including wrongful convictions that were later overturned due to constitutional issues and a lack of matching DNA evidence. Despite the passage of time and numerous dead ends, there is renewed hope that advancements in DNA technology could finally identify the perpetrator from a small sample found at the scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare strategy using a swarm of drones capable of creating an "electromagnetic storm eye." This technology aims to selectively jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a protective bubble around friendly forces, where jamming signals are cancelled out. Led by a professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, the research suggests this method offers a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming. The system works by precisely coordinating the drones' signals to generate a targeted null zone for allied troops.</p>

          <p>Singer Justin Timberlake has publicly confirmed that he is battling Lyme disease, a condition he described as potentially "implacably debilitating." In an Instagram post, he shared that he was diagnosed during his recent Forget Tomorrow tour and considered ending it early but chose to continue performing. Lyme disease, transmitted by ticks, can cause flu-like symptoms, joint pain, and neurological issues, but is typically treatable with antibiotics. Timberlake expressed gratitude for his family's support and uncertainty about his future on stage, but said he would always treasure his past performances.</p>

          <p>Recent films depicting the Nanking Massacre have sparked widespread reflection in China, particularly among younger generations who are learning about a historical trauma that continues to influence national identity and foreign policy. The author of this opinion article reflects on the profound and lasting shock of learning about the event, describing it as a moral wound that has never been properly acknowledged by the Japanese government. For many Chinese people, the massacre is not just a tragic historical chapter but a deeply personal and painful memory that shapes their collective consciousness and relationship with the past.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee man was arrested after police discovered 14 improvised explosive devices in his home while serving a warrant for threats he made against public officials. According to the Polk County sheriff's office, Kevin Wade O'Neal threatened to kill law enforcement personnel, prompting the warrant. During the arrest, officers noticed a smoldering device in his bedroom, which he had allegedly attempted to detonate. The 54-year-old now faces 11 counts of attempted first-degree murder, corresponding to the officers and other individuals present, as well as multiple weapons charges.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million, despite the player expressing his desire to stay at the club. The potential sale is linked to United's strong interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club insists it can make a new signing without first selling players, an exit would likely be necessary to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. Selling Hojlund for £30m would represent a book loss for United, as he is only two years into his five-year contract.</p>

          <h2>Meta Signals a More Cautious Approach to Open-Source AI Amid China's Rapid Advancement</h2>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts sharply with China's approach, where a highly competitive open-source ecosystem is driving rapid innovation in AI. Computer scientist Andrew Ng has noted that while top proprietary models are from the U.S., the best open models are now predominantly from China. This is evidenced by recent releases from companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI, who are pushing the boundaries of advanced AI models.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, offering a personal commitment from himself and President Trump to work towards their release. The meeting in Tel Aviv took place during a protest where families urged Israel's government to intensify efforts to free their loved ones, nearly 22 months into the war. Fears for the remaining hostages' survival have grown, especially after Hamas and Islamic Jihad released videos showing captives who appeared visibly emaciated and unwell. The families are imploring officials to secure a deal to end the conflict and bring the captives home.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus sent to Winston Churchill as a gift from Australia in 1943 has been solved. For decades, it was rumored that the platypus, named Winston, died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack during its voyage. However, new research by university students and museum archivists who examined the ship's logs and attendant's notes reveals a different cause. The evidence indicates that the platypus likely succumbed to overheating, as water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above a safe threshold as it crossed the equator.</p>

The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest addition to the country's more than 4,400 amusement facilities, a number projected to grow significantly. According to the global theme park industry association, these attractions act as powerful economic drivers, with every yuan of operating revenue generating nearly four yuan in the local economy. This strategy aims to create jobs, stimulate tourism, and encourage spending in related sectors like hospitality and retail. (not investment advice)</p>

Schake warns that allies are already beginning to hedge against American power, potentially leading to a post-American world where international cooperation erodes.

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with far-right and white nationalist ideologies. Mason traces how rhetoric within the movement shifted from a goal of overturning Roe v. Wade to a more insurrectionary stance of ignoring the rule of law. She connects the tactics and conspiracy theories seen in anti-abortion activism, such as the idea of a global cabal, to the ideologies present among the January 6 Capitol rioters, suggesting a convergence of these movements.</p>
