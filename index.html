            <p>Donald Trump stated that Volodymyr Zelensky bears some responsibility for the deaths in the Ukraine war, alongside Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden. Trump questioned Zelensky's competence and criticized his approach to the conflict, particularly his reliance on missile purchases. These remarks followed a deadly Russian missile attack on Sumy, Ukraine, which resulted in numerous casualties. Trump insisted on his desire to end the conflict and hinted at upcoming proposals, while Zelensky has urged Trump to visit Ukraine before making any deals with Putin.</p>

            <p>US Vice-President JD Vance expressed optimism about a potential trade deal between the US and the UK, despite recent global trade shakeups initiated by President Trump's tariffs. Vance cited a more reciprocal relationship as a reason for easier negotiations compared to other European countries. He also emphasized the need for Europe to strengthen its self-defense capabilities and reiterated the administration's stance on understanding both sides in the Ukraine war. The comments come amid ongoing talks between the US and the UK, focusing on lowering tariffs and addressing trade in goods and services.</p>

            <p>A Chinese research team has identified how breast cancer cells utilize the amino acid arginine to evade the immune system and proliferate. The study, published in Cancer Cell, reveals that metabolic interaction between cancer cells and macrophages plays a crucial role in arginine-driven breast cancer progression. This discovery could pave the way for new precision therapies that target arginine metabolism to starve tumors and prevent their growth. Macrophages are white blood cells that clear dead cells and stimulate immune function.</p>

            <p>The US Education Department is freezing approximately $2.3 billion in federal funds to Harvard University, citing the university's defiance of demands to crack down on antisemitism and alleged civil rights violations. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, stated that the university would not comply with the Trump administration's demands to dismantle diversity programs and limit student protests in exchange for federal funding. The Trump administration's demands include government and leadership reforms, "merit-based" admissions, and a ban on face masks. The move has sparked protests and legal challenges, with critics arguing it infringes on academic freedom.</p>

            <p>Senior advisers to President Trump reportedly warned of the potentially devastating effects of proposed tariffs on global financial markets and the US economy.

            <p>A severe sandstorm in Iraq has left over a thousand people with respiratory issues, particularly in the central and southern regions. Muthanna province reported at least 700 cases of suffocation, with hospitals across multiple provinces treating patients, including children, for breathing difficulties. The storm blanketed the region in an orange haze, reducing visibility to less than one kilometer and causing power cuts and flight suspensions. Experts suggest that climate change is contributing to the increasing frequency of such dust storms in Iraq.</p>

            <p>A freeze on federal funding by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the US. Over 22 tribes and nonprofits have had approximately $350 million in funding suspended, often without prior notice. These projects, aimed at addressing climate change threats and improving living conditions, face uncertainty as tribes await information on the status of their grants. The funding was part of the EPA's Community Change Grants, distributed under the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
