          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, fulfilling expectations. Ward's selection marks the third consecutive year a quarterback has been chosen first overall, highlighting the position's significance in the league. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Colorado's Travis Hunter, showcasing the draft's unpredictability, while the draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first 12 picks being linemen. The event, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, also saw speculation around Shedeur Sanders' draft position. Optimism in the NFL is high as the season begins with new talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons, acting as an NFL Draft analyst, displayed strong reactions to his team's draft choices. He expressed disappointment when the Carolina Panthers selected wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan, a player he hoped the Cowboys would draft. Parsons' reaction to the Cowboys' actual pick, offensive lineman Tyler Booker, was initially lukewarm, though he later claimed to be excited. This follows a similar reaction last year when the Cowboys drafted another offensive lineman, highlighting Parsons' clear preferences for certain positions and players for the team. It is interesting to see this emotional reaction from a player. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, an area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a flashpoint between China and the Philippines. The potential for conflict arises if the Philippines pursues unilateral resource exploration. While joint development has been explored, tensions have stalled progress, leaving the resources untapped. However, factors such as limited development capacity and regional political considerations might delay the emergence of Reed Bank as a major conflict zone. If this area is developed, there could be an increase in stability.</p>

          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a Rwandan beekeeper living in the Hamptons, has been charged with immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his involvement in the Rwandan genocide. Prosecutors claim he directed Hutu people to kill Tutsi people, participated in attacks, and ordered the disposal of bodies, all while lying about his past to gain refugee status and citizenship in the United States. If convicted, he faces imprisonment and potential deportation to Rwanda, where he is wanted for his alleged role in the genocide. This case is a reminder of the long reach of justice.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The prosecution argues that Mangione intentionally killed Thompson to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the healthcare industry. They also cite Mangione's efforts to evade law enforcement as evidence of future danger, as Attorney General Pam Bondi cited President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime as justification for pursuing the death penalty. This is a major legal and political move.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests China could improve its soft power in Africa by adopting a non-governmental organization (NGO) model similar to Western nations. While China has invested heavily in African infrastructure, its engagement is primarily government-to-government, lacking grassroots relationships. Western NGOs, in contrast, offer social services and build community ties, projecting compassion and shared humanity. This approach could help counter narratives of China as a neocolonial power and foster better human connections. It is an interesting idea to consider.</p>

          <p>Joseph Kling, 19, has been charged with arson for allegedly starting the wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, which has consumed over 15,000 acres. Authorities say the fire was caused by a bonfire that was not properly extinguished. The fire has forced thousands to evacuate, destroyed a commercial building, and prompted air quality concerns in New York City. The wildfire is currently 50% contained, with rain expected to aid in extinguishing the flames. The hope is that the rain will help end the crisis.</p>

ActBlue is the main platform used to collect donations for Democratic candidates and causes. The move is among several actions the Trump administration has taken to “cripple the left”, the New York Times has reported, part of a “series of highly partisan official actions that, if successful, will threaten to hobble Democrats’ ability to compete in elections for years to come”.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has said he is "not happy" with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and that President Vladimir Putin should "stop" - but has not said if further action might be taken against Russia. Overnight into Thursday, the attacks on the Ukrainian capital killed at least 12 people and injured dozens of others. The US president said he is "putting a lot of pressure" on both sides to end the war in Ukraine, following the deadliest attacks Kyiv has seen since last July. It is the latest road bump in efforts to advance a peace deal between the two countries - something the US president said he would be able to quickly do as part of his election campaign last year. This is a negative turn of events.</p>
