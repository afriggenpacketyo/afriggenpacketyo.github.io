          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family as a gift, intended for use as Air Force One and later to be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.

The aircraft, valued around $400 million, would first be modified by the U.S. Air Force to meet military specifications before being transferred to the library foundation by January 1, 2029.</p>

          <p>Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, numerous attempts to broker a lasting peace in Ukraine have failed. Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed a new round of ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul, but European leaders have rejected direct talks without an unconditional ceasefire first. A history of broken ceasefires and agreements, including the Budapest Memorandum and the Minsk agreements, highlights the ongoing challenges in securing a lasting peace. The latest developments come amid prolonged negotiations between the US and Ukraine, and, separately, between American and Russian diplomats.</p>

          <p>Germany is grappling with the question of how to deal with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with growing concern that society is becoming increasingly polarized. The AfD has been classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the German domestic intelligence service, but the party has challenged this in court. There is debate over whether to ban the AfD, with opponents arguing it would further promote social division, while supporters insist that enemies of democracy should not be in a position to destroy democracy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Israel have announced a plan to allow food and essential supplies back into Gaza, but top aid groups object to the proposal. The plan would force Gaza's population to move south to receive aid in a new zone cordoned off by Israel's military. Key details remain unresolved, like who would run it or pay for it. The main aid organizations working in Gaza are refusing to cooperate with the proposal, as presented by Israeli officials to the U.N. and its aid partners, saying they cannot work with a program that refuses aid to anyone seeking it, even belligerents.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between India and Pakistan was shaken by overnight fighting in disputed Kashmir, just hours after a U.S.-led deal was reached. Both sides accused each other of violating the agreement, with India claiming its military strikes killed over 100 militants. The escalation in violence began after a gun massacre of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir. As part of the ceasefire, the nuclear-armed neighbors agreed to immediately stop all military action on land, in the air, and at sea.</p>

          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan appeared to be largely holding, as both countries claimed victory after a four-day conflict. President Trump announced the ceasefire with the help of U.S. mediation. However, India made no reference to an American role, hoping to avoid any domestic perception that it had stopped fighting under outside pressure. Some supporters of the Indian government cast the truce as a victory owing to the might of the Indian armed forces, while Pakistan celebrated what it viewed as a successful defense.</p>

The treasury secretary did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry’s desperate plea to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, potentially undermining the monarchy's attempts to model unity. Charles, despite undergoing cancer treatment, has continued his public duties, but Harry’s comments have drawn attention back to the rift that opened when he and his wife, Meghan, withdrew from royal life. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign and undercut messages of tolerance and inclusiveness.</p>

The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.</p>

Nicolas Jackson's act of wild indiscipline, resulting in a red card, has compounded the issue, as he will now miss pivotal final games. If Chelsea win the Conference League but do not qualify for the Champions League, Maresca must expect this season to be judged as failure.</p>
