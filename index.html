          <p>South Korea's primary stock index, the KOSPI, surged to a record high, buoyed by an upgraded economic growth forecast from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF increased its 2025 growth projection for the country, citing the private sector's adaptability and the resilience of the global trading system. This market optimism was further fueled by statements from the U.S. Treasury Secretary indicating that trade negotiations between the two nations were nearing completion. Major sectors like autos and electronics led the gains, with prominent companies such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor seeing significant stock price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has released its final report on the 2023 Titan submersible implosion, attributing the fatal incident to critical engineering flaws. The investigation found that the carbon fiber composite pressure vessel failed to meet necessary strength requirements due to multiple construction anomalies. The report states that operator OceanGate did not adequately test the vessel, leaving the company unaware of its structural weaknesses, which led to the preventable tragedy that killed all five passengers. Additionally, the NTSB noted that flawed data analysis from previous dives meant the company missed clear signs that the submersible was already damaged and should have been decommissioned.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations within Venezuela. When questioned about his reasoning, the president cited the need to combat drug trafficking and address his unsubstantiated claims that Venezuela is intentionally sending prisoners and individuals from mental institutions to the United States. The announcement drew immediate condemnation from the Venezuelan government, which accused the U.S. of pursuing a "regime change" policy. This development follows a series of U.S. military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have surpassed a significant fundraising goal to continue their lawsuit against the local school district. A federal judge had ordered them to pay a $125,000 bond to cover the district's potential legal fees if the parents lose their case. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of their sons, who were suspended and found responsible for sexual harassment after they objected to a transgender student using the male-only locker room. With the help of an online fundraiser, the parents successfully raised the required funds before the deadline, allowing their legal challenge to proceed while a temporary halt on the suspensions remains in effect.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given assurances that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for the cessation was not provided. Trump stated that this move is crucial for pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine and mentioned that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process." India, one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, has previously defended its purchases as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices. The U.S. has been actively discouraging countries from buying Russian oil to limit Moscow's revenue, which funds its military operations.</p>

In its filing, Air China stated that an estimated 4,400 ticket holders for November and December would be affected.

The judge stated that the administration's actions, which President Trump linked to targeting programs favored by Democrats, appear to be contrary to law and unprecedented.

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive, Kate Wareing, has proposed a new model to address the costly and controversial use of hotels to house asylum seekers. Her plan suggests the government should fund councils and housing associations to purchase properties, which would then be added to the social housing stock. This would not only provide more stable and significantly cheaper accommodation for asylum seekers but also create new housing opportunities for local residents in need. The proposal, which has reportedly been discussed with government departments, aims to cut accommodation costs from £54,000 to just £4,000 per person annually while increasing the nation's overall social housing supply.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal legislation to regulate artificial intelligence is essential, as individual states have begun to implement their own safeguards. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, the Tennessee Republican emphasized the need for a national standard to protect consumers and children from the risks associated with AI, such as data privacy violations and harmful content from chatbots. Blackburn is a proponent of the Kid's Online Safety Act and is also focused on legislation to prevent the unauthorized use of a person's name, image, or likeness by AI systems. She stressed that regulation must focus on the end uses of AI rather than specific technologies.</p>

          <p>A major lawsuit involving 3,000 people has been filed in the UK against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the company of knowingly selling baby powder contaminated with asbestos and concealing the cancer risks for decades. The legal claim, supported by internal company memos, alleges that J&J was aware as early as the 1960s that its talc contained asbestos-like fibers linked to deadly cancers but never warned consumers. Instead, the company is accused of running marketing campaigns that portrayed the product as safe and pure. J&J denies the allegations, stating its baby powder was compliant with regulations, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.</p>

          <p>Hamas has handed over the bodies of two more Israeli hostages as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement but claims it cannot retrieve the remaining deceased due to logistical challenges. The group's armed wing stated that locating and recovering the other bodies from the ruins of Gaza requires specialized equipment and significant effort. This development complicates the first phase of the peace plan, which requires Hamas to return all 28 dead hostages. Senior U.S. advisors have indicated they do not currently believe Hamas has broken the agreement, asserting the group is acting in good faith to locate the remaining bodies.</p>

Crawford had been on death row for over 30 years following his conviction. His final appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied shortly before the execution was carried out. His lawyers had argued for a new trial based on a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, claiming his constitutional rights were violated when his original trial lawyers pursued an insanity defense against his wishes to maintain his innocence. In his final statement, Crawford addressed Ray's family, speaking of finding peace through God.</p>

Patel did not specify the funding source but thanked President Trump for finding a way to pay the agents. This follows a similar move by the administration to ensure military service members receive their paychecks using unspent funds from the previous fiscal year. While the FBI Agents Association expressed gratitude, it noted that other essential FBI staff, like analysts, are not covered and called on Congress to reopen the government to end the operational disruptions.</p>

The agency issued an order requiring the carrier to show why it should not be barred from providing services to and from the U.S. The FCC's action is based on HKT's affiliation with China Unicom, an entity already on the commission's Covered List of companies deemed a threat. This move reflects escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing and is part of the FCC's broader effort to prevent entities controlled by the Chinese Communist Party from accessing U.S. telecommunication networks.</p>

The upcoming "15th five-year plan" is expected to address significant challenges, including increased U.S. technology restrictions and weak domestic demand. Analysts anticipate Beijing will double down on reforms to boost internal consumption and increase support for high-tech sectors like AI and semiconductors to achieve its long-term goal of technological self-reliance. The meeting's outcomes will signal how China plans to balance national security with economic development in an increasingly hostile global environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The military stepped in after former president Andry Rajoelina was impeached and fled, an event the military describes as "taking responsibility" to prevent the country's collapse rather than a coup. The new transitional government has pledged to hold elections within 18 to 24 months. The unconstitutional change of power has drawn concern from the international community, with the African Union suspending Madagascar from the bloc with immediate effect.</p>

She chose Manahil, leaving Masajed to succumb to her illness. This heartbreaking story highlights the devastating toll of the country's civil war, which has displaced millions, destroyed infrastructure, and left families with no resources to save their children.
