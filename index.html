          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea fired multiple presumed short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast from near Monsanto, with the missiles traveling up to 800 kilometers before landing in the sea. South Korea, the United States, and Japan are collaborating to analyze the launch, which may be a test of missiles intended for export, according to a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesperson. The launch violates UN Security Council resolutions banning North Korea's ballistic missile program. There are concerns that North Korea may be testing weapons for potential export to Russia for use in the conflict against Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, faces federal hate crime charges for three separate assaults on Jewish protesters at demonstrations in Manhattan. Prosecutors say Bazrouk kicked and punched protesters wearing religious attire or carrying Israeli flags and that the incidents occurred over nine months. A search of his cellphone revealed pro-Hamas propaganda and messages identifying himself as a "Jew hater." The charges come amid increased scrutiny of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and accusations of antisemitism, with some protesters facing deportation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a new trade agreement, his first since implementing tariffs that initially destabilized markets. The agreement follows a period of trade discussions with various countries, including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and India. These talks were initiated after Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods and reciprocal tariffs aimed at altering trading practices. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials to discuss trade issues.</p>

          <p>A Sacramento family, led by Tou Sue Vang, ran an illegal enterprise buying stolen catalytic converters and selling them to a New Jersey buyer, amassing over $38 million. Vang was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while his brother and mother await sentencing after pleading guilty to conspiracy and money-laundering charges. The converters were sold to DG Auto in New Jersey, which then sold the precious metals to a metal refinery for over $600 million. Vang used the illicit funds to purchase real estate, vehicles, and watercraft, which have been forfeited as part of his sentence.</p>

          <p>India said it carried out strikes on Pakistan in retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed 26 civilians in Kashmir. The Indian government said its forces struck nine sites in Pakistan and on Pakistan’s side of the disputed Kashmir region, and it is said that at least two Indian aircraft went down inside India. The strikes, named "Operation Sindoor," have escalated tensions between the nuclear-armed archrivals, who have fought numerous wars over the disputed area of Kashmir.</p>
