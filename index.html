            <p>President Trump met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White House to discuss trade relations amid ongoing tariff disagreements with the European Union. Trump expressed optimism about reaching a trade deal with the EU, stating that "every nation" is on his priority list for negotiations, although China's involvement remains uncertain. The talks occur amidst Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's stance on tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth.

            <p>Syria is hoping for a return of tourists to the ancient city of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that has been ravaged by war and ISIS attacks.

            <p>This Atlantic opinion piece argues that Trump's past actions indicate a willingness to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, similar to his politicization of the FBI. The author suggests that Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell is driven by a need to blame someone for the economic consequences of his trade war. The piece expresses concern that Trump may attempt to install a loyalist at the Fed, potentially destabilizing financial markets. The author concludes that the Fed's independence, once considered inviolable, is now at risk. Optimism score: 15</p>
