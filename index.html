          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has withdrawn its appeal against a judge's ruling that permitted the KalshiEx exchange to offer betting contracts on the outcomes of U.S. political elections. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed this as a victory for prediction markets, while financial reform advocates criticized the decision as a betrayal of public interest, arguing it could threaten election integrity. The agreement stipulates that both parties will cover their own costs, and Kalshi will relinquish all legal claims related to the case. Donald Trump Jr. serves as a strategic advisor for Kalshi, which currently offers contracts on various political events.</p>

          <p>In Karen Read's murder retrial, a paramedic testified that she heard Read say, "I hit him," multiple times after her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, was found unresponsive in the snow. Prosecutors allege Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in a blizzard in 2022. The defense argues the police investigation was flawed and witnesses colluded on their narrative. The paramedic, Katie McLaughlin, stated she heard Read repeat the statement four times and did not ask for clarification due to the emotional situation.</p>

Travel consultants are advising anxious travelers to consider domestic trips instead of international travel. CBP officials maintain that searches of electronic devices have not significantly increased and that law-abiding travelers have nothing to fear.</p>
