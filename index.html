          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times reflects on the U.S. government's deportation of Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist, in 1955. The author argues that this decision, fueled by xenophobia during the McCarthy era, had staggering implications, as Qian returned to China and spearheaded its modern weapons program, ultimately transforming the country into a superpower. The author suggests this historical event serves as a cautionary tale amidst the Trump administration's targeting of foreign students and researchers, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The article emphasizes the importance of avoiding similar missteps driven by xenophobia that could undermine America's global standing and scientific prowess.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue seeking the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. This move is seen as a positive step towards resolving tensions between the two countries, though the registration and radiation checks may take several months before shipments can begin.</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York Cityâ€™s police commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik joined the NYPD in 1986 and served as the department's 40th commissioner from 2000 to 2001 under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. His career was later tarnished after he pleaded guilty to federal corruption and tax crimes, leading to a prison sentence before receiving a pardon from President Trump. Despite the controversies, he is remembered by some as a dedicated public servant who helped rebuild the city after 9/11.</p>

          <p>Businesses near Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are facing financial burdens due to the installation's name changes. Ralph Rodriguez, owner of a pawn and gun shop, initially named his business Fort Liberty Pawn & Gun, anticipating support from the military community, however, the installation was rechristened Fort Bragg, this time in honor of World War II paratrooper Roland Bragg of Maine. This decision requires him to spend approximately $30,000 to update signage, uniforms, and other materials. While some businesses are sticking with the name Liberty, others are reverting to Bragg to avoid alienating customers, highlighting the challenges of navigating local sentiments amidst political changes.</p>

          <p>A Chinese economist warns that financial sanctions could become a new battleground in the rivalry between China and the United States. Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, suggests that Washington might gradually expand sanctions against specific Chinese entities, potentially pushing China out of the US dollar system. While full-scale financial sanctions are deemed less likely, Lian notes that such measures could significantly damage the Swift system, prompting countries to shift towards China's alternative Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). This highlights the growing concerns over escalating tensions and the potential for financial warfare between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily pause a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration had threatened to seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on hold. The ruling destabilized a pillar of Trump's economic agenda, as the three-judge trade court panel invalidated all of Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and other duties. This pause gives the Trump administration some breathing room as it prepares to argue that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process (not investment advice).</p>
