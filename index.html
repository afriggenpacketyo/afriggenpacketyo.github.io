            <h2>UK Parliament Investigates Police Preparedness for Summer Riots</h2>

            <p>A UK parliamentary report reveals that some police forces were unprepared for the summer riots following the fatal stabbing of three children in Southport in July 2024. The report acknowledges the efforts of officers but highlights that the lack of proactive measures exposed them to significant risk, with 302 officers injured. It also addresses misinformation spread online after the attack, recommending the Crown Prosecution Service update its media protocol. The report commends the bravery of the police and disagrees with claims of "two-tier policing", stating that officers were responding to criminal behavior, not political views.</p>

            <p>Singapore has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and services sectors, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore eased its monetary policy for the second time. The move comes after the city-state reported a lower-than-expected 3.8% GDP expansion for the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry attributes the slowdown to sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. and the U.S.-China trade war, which are expected to deteriorate the growth outlook for both countries. The central bank will reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band, the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A man's Reddit post about refusing to drive when his wife is in the car due to her constant backseat driving has sparked a lively debate online. The user explained that his wife's criticisms of his driving caused him significant stress, leading him to make her drive instead. While this initially resolved the issue, his wife became upset about always being behind the wheel, prompting a discussion about shared responsibility. Commenters offered a range of advice, from recording her complaints to suggesting therapy for underlying anger issues, while a psychologist emphasized the importance of mutual respect and emotional safety in relationships.</p>

            <p>Sony has raised the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, attributing the decision to a "challenging economic environment" characterized by high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The PS5 with HD Blu-ray disk drive was spared the price increase in Europe and the U.K, as well as the PS5 Pro. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, anticipates a similar price hike in the U.S. once the direction of tariffs becomes clearer. This is not the first time Sony has increased prices for the console, having previously done so in 2022 and 2024.</p>

He criticizes the loss of Irish identity due to immigration and challenges establishment views. The elite dismiss his chances, but McGregor's appeal to populism and ability to connect with disillusioned voters could make him a formidable candidate.</p>

            <p>Tenants on the Nags Head Estate in east London are battling Peabody housing association over long-standing issues of damp and mould in their homes, which they blame for respiratory illnesses and mental health problems. The tenants have enlisted lawyers and health workers from Medact, a health justice campaign charity, to push for a solution. Peabody says it has invested over £1m on improvements but that it will take time to resolve all the issues. A survey by Medact found high rates of health problems among residents, likely linked to the widespread mould and damp.</p>

            <p>The author reflects on the changing perception of the United States as it approaches the 100th day of Donald Trump's second term, noting a growing conversation about how the world can pivot away from US influence. The challenges of imagining a post-American world are both technical and psychological, given the US's central role in shaping the global order. The article argues that the US's breakdown should trigger a project to build a new global order in which all countries have a stake, acknowledging the need for independence from the US's influence.</p>

The play pays tribute to manager Harry Batt, who was banned from English football for forming the team. The play follows the team as they compete in front of 90,000 fans in Mexico before being banned on their return. The play ends on a positive note, showing how the game has come full circle with the Lionesses winning Euro 2022.</p>

            <p>China's exports surged by 12.4% in March, driven by businesses frontloading shipments to avoid impending tariff increases from the United States. However, analysts suggest this could be a "final hurrah" before a potential decline in exports due to escalating trade tensions. Imports also fell by 4.3%, leading to a trade surplus of US$102.64 billion for March. The global trade landscape remains uncertain, with drastic tariff increases from the US and retaliatory measures from Beijing creating challenges for businesses.</p>
