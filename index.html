          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang's visit to Cairo signals a deepening of the strategic partnership between China and Egypt, rooted in historical Silk Road connections and now advanced through the Belt and Road Initiative. Li pledged to encourage more Chinese investment in Egypt, building on major infrastructure projects like Africa's tallest skyscraper and the modernization of Egypt's power grid. This collaboration aims to bolster trade, finance, and technology, while also positioning China as a key player in resolving Middle Eastern crises and expanding its regional influence.</p>

          <p>In response to a prolonged earthquake swarm near the Tokara Islands, Japan's government has approved upgraded disaster defense plans. The focus is on mitigating the threat of the feared Nankai Trough earthquake, which has an 80% probability of occurring within 30 years. The new strategy aims to reduce the projected death toll by 80% through infrastructure like taller sea walls and refuge towers, but experts emphasize that public education on rapid evacuation is even more critical. The plan also incorporates lessons from the 2011 Fukushima disaster to improve the safety of coastal nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in parts of California based solely on factors like race or location. The ruling, a victory for the ACLU and other advocacy groups, found that "roving patrols" without reasonable suspicion are unconstitutional. In response, the Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, while President Trump authorized law enforcement to arrest anyone they believe is assaulting them, referencing recent clashes between protesters and federal agents.</p>

These tariffs, an outgrowth of global rates first imposed in April, could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers. This approach creates policy uncertainty, as the president himself has given conflicting statements on the firmness of the deadline, and so far only one new deal, with the U.K., has been finalized.

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Israel's Rafah Plan is a Crime, But International Law Has Consistently Failed Palestinians</h2>

          <p>In this opinion article, author Raja Shehadeh argues that while Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity, Palestinians should not be surprised by the failure of international law to protect them. He asserts that from the 1948 Nakba to the present, international law has lacked effective enforcement, consistently failing to hold Israel accountable for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank. The author places his hope not in legal institutions, but in the enduring resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people to survive.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a deal for a second batch of 180 South Korean K2 tanks, part of a larger 2022 agreement that underscores South Korea's growing role as a global arms supplier. As US allies face depleted stockpiles due to conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, countries like Poland are turning to Seoul for advanced weaponry. Poland, bordering Ukraine, is significantly increasing its defense spending to become a major European military force. This strategic partnership highlights a shift in the global arms trade, with South Korea's defense industry becoming increasingly vital to US allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Gaza Ceasefire and Hostage Release Negotiations Reportedly on the Verge of Collapse</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 00:20:41 EDT</div>

          <p>According to Palestinian officials, the latest round of ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, held in Doha, is close to collapsing. The officials claim the Israeli delegation deliberately stalled the talks and lacked the authority to make decisions on key issues like the extent of troop withdrawal and aid distribution. Deep divisions remain, particularly over a map presented by Israel that showed a much larger "buffer zone" than previously discussed, which Hamas officials viewed as a bad-faith maneuver. The faltering talks diminish hopes for an imminent truce and hostage release deal.</p>
