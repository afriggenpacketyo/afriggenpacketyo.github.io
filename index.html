          <h2>Crystal Palace Challenges Europa League Demotion at CAS</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:34:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Crystal Palace has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against UEFA's decision to demote them from the Europa League to the Conference League. The punishment stems from alleged breaches of multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor owns stakes in both Crystal Palace and Lyon, with both clubs having qualified for the Europa League. Palace contends that Textor does not hold decisive influence, a defense UEFA did not accept. If the appeal is unsuccessful, Nottingham Forest, who finished seventh in the Premier League, is expected to take Palace's Europa League spot. A ruling from CAS is expected by August 11, before the Europa League group stage commences on September 24.</p>

          <p>Todd Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the Justice Department, announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, acting under Attorney General Pam Bondi's direction. This outreach comes as a House Oversight and Reform Committee subcommittee approved a motion to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition. Despite this, Blanche affirmed the DOJ and FBI's earlier memo, which concluded Epstein died by suicide and had no "client list," while also stating no credible evidence for blackmail was found. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls, and her lawyers confirmed discussions, expressing gratitude to President Trump for his commitment to truth.</p>

          <p>Edith Chapin, NPR's editor-in-chief and acting chief content officer, has announced her decision to step down, a move that comes just days after Congress voted to strip public broadcasting of all federal funding. Chapin emphasized that her choice was personal, driven by a desire for a break after two years in demanding executive positions, and not a direct reaction to the congressional action. NPR CEO Katherine Maher expressed gratitude for Chapin's contributions and outlined plans for an $8 million operating budget reduction to aid affected member stations. While federal funds constitute less than 2% of NPR's budget, they are crucial for many member stations, particularly in rural and tribal areas.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the August 12 deadline for President Trump's trade tariffs with China will likely be extended, with high-level talks scheduled to take place in Stockholm, Sweden, next week. Bessent expressed a positive outlook on the current trade relationship, describing it as having moved to a "very constructive" level, suggesting potential for significant progress. Beyond tariffs, discussions are expected to cover China's industrial overproduction, efforts to foster a consumer economy, and Beijing's acquisition of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This development signals a continued diplomatic approach to resolving economic tensions and fostering broader cooperation between the two global powers. (not investment advice)</p>

Concerns have been raised about his professional conduct, including accusations of abusive behavior and an instance where seven DOJ lawyers resigned rather than comply with his controversial order to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.

The article explains that individuals possess multiple "selves" influenced by various factors, and acting solely on raw emotion without considering impact can damage relationships. Instead, the expert advocates for "self-leadership," which involves recognizing inner multiplicity, aiming for alignment with values, prioritizing self-awareness over constant self-expression, and choosing responsibility over rawness. This approach encourages intentional curation of one's behavior in different situations, fostering healthier interactions and personal growth.</p>

The stock, which had been trading mostly below $1 this year, hit a high of $4.97, leading to multiple trading halts due to its extreme volatility. This significant rally, amounting to a 590% increase in July alone, is further amplified by a substantial short interest of approximately 22% and heightened options trading. The phenomenon suggests that short-covering, where short sellers buy back shares to limit losses, is playing a role in accelerating the stock's upward movement. (not investment advice)</p>

Financial advisors, such as Mary Kay Sloan from Prudential Advisors, note these rates are among the best observed, but warn that future annuity rates will likely follow if broader interest rates decline. While beneficial for long-term income and risk mitigation, experts emphasize that annuities are not universally suitable, particularly for individuals requiring liquidity or focused on short-term financial objectives.

          <p>Renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian has publicly urged Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to voluntarily resign, asserting that such a step is crucial to preserving the central bank's operational autonomy. El-Erian, a chief economic advisor at Allianz, acknowledged that his stance deviates from the prevailing Wall Street consensus, which largely favors Powell serving out his term. He contended that Powell's departure, while not a "first best" outcome, would be superior to the current situation, where the Fed faces "growing and broadening threats" to its independence. This call follows Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's recent suggestion for a comprehensive review of the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, highlighting the increasing political pressures on the institution.

He reaffirmed his long-held skepticism towards relying on external bankers for deal advice, often criticizing their significant fees and inherent motivations to facilitate acquisitions.

          <p>The Trump administration's border chief, Tom Homan, has declared a new, intensified phase of deportation efforts, specifically targeting so-called "sanctuary cities." Homan branded these municipalities as "sanctuaries for criminals" following an incident in New York City where an off-duty law enforcement officer was allegedly shot by an undocumented person with a criminal record. He announced plans to "flood the zone" with Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents, aiming to overcome the perceived lack of cooperation from Democrat-run cities in arresting and detaining undocumented individuals. This aggressive strategy signals a significant escalation in the administration's approach to immigration enforcement across the United States.</p>

While law enforcement agencies have never accused Trump of wrongdoing related to Epstein, and he has not been named a target of any investigation, the report adds a historical dimension to the ongoing scrutiny of Epstein's network.</p>

Furthermore, the centers are noted for operating for extremely brief periods, sometimes as short as eight minutes, intensifying the danger.

          <p>Following President Trump's assertion that cane sugar Coke is "just better," experts weigh in, concluding that both cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess. While cane sugar is sucrose (50% glucose, 50% fructose) and corn syrup is typically 55% fructose, both contribute to issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Registered dietitians emphasize that both provide "empty calories" and have a similarly high glycemic index. The consensus is that moderation is key for all added sugars, as most Americans consume far more than recommended daily amounts. (not investment advice)</p>
