          <p>An investigation has revealed allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and safeguarding failures within the Diocese of Bangor, linked to the Archbishop of Wales's cathedral. Former choir members and participants described excessive alcohol consumption, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday, and reported instances of sexual assault at a cathedral event. The Church in Wales acknowledged the concerns, stating that the "inappropriate use of alcohol" was being addressed and a new policy was in development following two critical reports that led to the archbishop's early retirement.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic flash flood in Texas has resulted in at least 24 deaths, with a major search and rescue operation underway for many others, including up to 25 girls from a summer camp. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically by 26 feet in under an hour, sweeping away cabins and vehicles during the July 4th weekend. Officials have declared a state of emergency in several counties, and President Trump has pledged federal assistance for the "terrible" tragedy. The response is hampered by washed-out roads and downed communication lines, while officials noted the flood's severity far exceeded weather predictions.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on extensive tariffs proposed by the Trump administration is ending, raising concerns about a potential trade shock and increased inflation. Despite claims of negotiating numerous deals, few have materialized, leaving the U.S. on the verge of imposing steep duties on dozens of countries. Business leaders and economists worry about the impact on American companies and consumers, who are already feeling the effects of existing tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that these costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers, a reality the administration disputes while insisting other countries pay the tariffs.

          <p>Despite large turnouts for events like Pride in London, LGBTQ+ Pride organizations across the UK are facing significant financial challenges due to a sharp decline in corporate funding and volunteer numbers. A survey by the UK Pride Organisers Network revealed that over 85 groups have seen reduced sponsorships, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or begin charging for previously free events. Organizers attribute the funding drop to a shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives by global corporations, as well as rising operational costs. Despite these struggles, organizers remain resilient, emphasizing Pride's importance as a protest and celebration.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have successfully restored damaged ear tissue in mice by activating a "genetic switch" that was previously disabled through evolution. The study, published in the journal Science, demonstrated that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A. By reactivating this pathway, researchers achieved complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage, in the mice's outer ears. The team believes this discovery proves the existence of a mechanism for organ regeneration that could potentially be present in other organs and, one day, be applicable to humans.</p>

Critics argue that Lai's government, in line with the Democratic Progressive Party's platform, is emphasizing a distinct Taiwanese identity at the expense of acknowledging the ROC's full history.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has denied an emergency request to stop the deportation of eight migrants, clearing the way for their removal by the Trump administration. The men, who have been convicted of serious crimes, were scheduled to be flown out on Friday evening. Their lawyers had argued that they could face perilous conditions, particularly one man being sent to war-torn South Sudan, a country the U.S. government advises against traveling to. This ruling is the latest development in a legal battle over the administration's high-profile deportation campaign, which has been challenged multiple times in federal courts.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some participants smashing storefronts, looting businesses, and harassing tourists in popular neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma. The march began peacefully, with hundreds of locals protesting soaring rent prices and displacement driven by an influx of foreign "digital nomads." Protesters held signs demanding stricter housing laws and an end to what they see as the takeover of their city. The escalation to vandalism marked a significant outpouring of mounting tensions over the changing social and economic landscape of the capital.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Enabling Quick Sale of Towed Vehicles Faces Criticism</h2>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizing them, a practice critics describe as predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted by operators who tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations, then charge fees that many cannot afford on short notice. One couple in Waterbury detailed how their apartment complex saw over 1,000 cars towed in two years by a single company. Critics argue the law facilitates a system that preys on financially vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire, California's largest wildfire of the year, has expanded to over 70,800 acres in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County and is only 10% contained.

More than 600 firefighting personnel, supported by air tankers from across the state, are battling the fire.

          <h2>President Trump Enacts Sweeping Tax and Spending Legislation</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed into law a major legislative package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent, boosts defense and border security funding, and enacts significant spending cuts to federal safety-net programs. The bill, which the President celebrated during a White House Fourth of July event, passed Congress by a narrow margin. Democrats have heavily criticized the legislation, warning it will primarily benefit the wealthy while increasing the national debt by an estimated $3 trillion and potentially causing millions to lose health insurance coverage through cuts to Medicaid.
