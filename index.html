          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act which restricts using the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling, currently on hold, emerged from a lawsuit by Governor Gavin Newsom and could create legal obstacles for Trump's plans to use troops in other cities. Judge Charles Breyer expressed concern that the president's actions risked creating a "national police force," and he blocked the Guard from performing law enforcement duties like arrests or crowd control in California.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, whose firm Berkshire Hathaway is the largest shareholder in Kraft Heinz, has stated his disappointment with the company's decision to split into two separate entities. Following his comments, the food conglomerate's shares fell by over 5%. Buffett remarked that the original 2015 merger, which he orchestrated with 3G Capital, did not turn out as expected, but he does not believe that deconstructing the company will solve its underlying problems. Kraft Heinz has struggled in recent years as consumer preferences shifted away from packaged foods, leading to a significant decline in its stock value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent dip in automotive shipments, China and Russia are strengthening their economic partnership, with analysts noting significant potential for growth in trade settled in their local currencies. During a visit by President Vladimir Putin to Beijing, the two nations signed over 20 bilateral agreements covering energy, technology, and agriculture. This collaboration is driven by Russia's need for consumer goods and machinery due to Western sanctions, and China's strategy to find new markets amid trade tensions with the United States. The new deals underscore a deepening alliance as both countries seek to counter U.S. economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The Delhi High Court has once again denied bail to nine individuals, including prominent student activists Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, who have been incarcerated for approximately five years without trial. They are accused of conspiring to orchestrate the February 2020 riots in Delhi under India's stringent anti-terror laws. The prosecution argues the riots were a pre-planned conspiracy to defame India, while defense lawyers cited the long period of detention and the granting of bail to other co-accused.

Nadler, who played a key role in both of President Trump's impeachments as the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested other aging Democrats should also consider stepping aside.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, banking experts are advising savers to make strategic moves with their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts this September. Key recommendations include locking in current high rates before they drop and considering no-penalty CDs, which offer flexibility for withdrawals despite slightly lower returns. Experts also caution against locking up too much cash in long-term CDs, suggesting a "CD ladder" approach to maintain liquidity. Finally, they emphasize the importance of shopping around at various financial institutions, as rates and terms can differ significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tax Experts Highlight Opportunity for 0% Capital Gains Under New Trump Legislation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that President Trump's latest tax legislation presents a "golden opportunity" for many investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains. The bill's new deductions for 2025 could allow more individuals to fall within the income thresholds for the zero-tax bracket, which applies to single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and joint filers up to $96,700. This creates a window for "tax-gain harvesting," where investors can sell profitable assets without incurring taxes. This strategy can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for potential future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The company cited a challenging macroeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand, particularly among its key Hispanic consumer base. Executives noted that high-end beer purchasing has decelerated, with declines in both trip frequency and spending. The revised outlook anticipates a 2% to 4% drop in net beer sales, a reversal from previous expectations of flat to modest growth, reflecting ongoing economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields surged after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal. The decision raised the prospect that the government might have to refund billions of dollars in collected tariff revenue, which would strain the national budget and potentially require increased Treasury issuance. The 30-year bond yield surpassed 4.97%, and the 10-year yield also rose significantly, contributing to a sharp drop in the stock market. This market reaction reflects investor anxiety over the country's fiscal stability if the substantial revenue stream from tariffs is suddenly reversed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, Russell Marubbio has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on DNA analysis that distinguished him from his identical twin brother. Investigators used advanced genetic genealogy to trace a 37-year-old DNA sample to the twins. Scientists then employed ultra-deep sequencing to identify minute, acquired genetic mutations that are unique to each twin, definitively linking Russell Marubbio to the crime scene evidence. This is the first time this specific technique has been successfully used in a U.S. court, setting a precedent for solving complex cases involving identical twins.</p>

          <p>China has showcased its new YJ-19 hypersonic cruise missile, a weapon that signifies a major leap in its aerospace and military technology. Unlike ballistic missiles that follow a predictable arc, the YJ-19 is believed to use a scramjet engine for sustained, powered flight, allowing it to maintain high speed and maneuverability throughout its trajectory. This advanced propulsion system takes in air at high speeds to generate thrust, overcoming extreme technical challenges. The development of the YJ-19 is part of China's broader effort to enhance its integrated military operations and presents a new level of strategic capability.</p>

If the ruling is upheld, the administration could be forced to refund billions of dollars in wrongfully collected taxes, a process fraught with administrative difficulty. This article argues that creating such messes is a consistent method for the administration, forcing courts to choose between enforcing legal limits and triggering widespread disruption.
