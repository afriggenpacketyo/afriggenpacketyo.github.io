          <p>President Trump stated that India is prepared to eliminate tariffs on US goods as part of ongoing trade negotiations, though Delhi has yet to confirm these remarks. Trump mentioned this potential deal at an event in Doha, Qatar, while also suggesting Apple should increase production in the United States instead of expanding in India. This announcement comes after the US imposed tariffs on Indian goods in April, prompting India to expedite trade deal discussions during a tariff pause set to end in July. The US remains a major trading partner for India, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian and Russian delegations have arrived in Turkey for potential negotiations aimed at ending the ongoing conflict between the two countries. However, there is initial uncertainty surrounding whether the talks will actually take place, with confusion over whether the delegations will even meet. The potential talks are being held at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul, a location that hosted previous discussions in March 2022. The negotiations are occurring amidst continued gamesmanship and a lack of clarity on the prospects for a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest defender Ola Aina suggests that Taiwo Awoniyi's injury could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag sooner during their recent match against Leicester City. Awoniyi collided with a post while attempting to reach a cross from Anthony Elanga, who was in an offside position. The assistant referee delayed raising the flag due to a protocol introduced in 2020, which allows play to continue until the sequence is completed. Awoniyi is currently recovering from surgery after being placed in an induced coma.</p>

          <p>Reports of crime on cruise ships departing from the U.S. have increased to a two-year high, raising concerns among travelers and negatively affecting the cruise industry. Data from the Department of Transportation indicate a rise in incidents such as sexual assaults, assaults, and other crimes on cruise ships. Experts attribute this increase to the high concentration of people in confined spaces and the prevalence of alcohol consumption. Recent incidents include the arrest of illegal immigrants for allegedly molesting a minor and a large brawl involving dozens of passengers disembarking from a Carnival cruise.</p>

          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%, driven primarily by the services sector. The Office for National Statistics noted significant growth in production as well. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the UK's economic strength, analysts caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite some skepticism about long-term prospects, businesses like Nc'nean Whisky Distillery are absorbing tariffs to maintain stable prices in the US market.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing the release of its rice stockpile to approximately 600,000 tons to address near-record high rice prices. This measure involves releasing an additional 300,000 tons over three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The move comes in response to rising rice prices and a suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. However, concerns are growing that depleting the stockpile could leave Japan vulnerable in the event of another poor harvest or natural disaster.</p>

          <p>A traffic stop in California led to the discovery of a baby spider monkey and two rattlesnakes at the home of a suspect arrested for methamphetamine possession. Police found additional methamphetamine and cash during the search. The animals were safely removed, with the spider monkey, named Violeta, being placed in the Oakland Zoo. This incident highlights the issue of wildlife trafficking, which is fueled by demand for exotic pets and profit-driven businesses. The suspect faces additional charges related to the possession of exotic animals.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 economies, including the United States and China, has cautioned that global growth is at risk of slowing significantly due to increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forecasts growth to decline to 2.6% in 2025, a drop from 3.6% in the previous year. These challenges are primarily attributed to tariff hikes, retaliatory measures, and non-tariff barriers, which are undermining business confidence and investment. Restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chains, and improving transparency in trade rules.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, boosted by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate, but potential U.S. tariffs are not a major factor due to the country's reliance on merchanting and processing systems. The IMF projects a slowdown in Denmark's output growth, citing anticipated weakness in export growth, including pharmaceuticals. However, the country is shielded from U.S. tariffs as most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. Danish drugmakers rely on intellectual property, contracting manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship products.</p>
