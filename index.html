          <p>President Trump highlighted an agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting that the deal would keep U.S. Steel headquartered in Pittsburgh and bring American jobs. He stated that Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, allocating funds to increase production in Pittsburgh and modernize facilities across several states, promising no layoffs or outsourcing. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," though specifics on the ownership structure were not detailed, and that he had rejected previous offers from Nippon until realizing their commitment to investing in America. The agreement, first announced on Trump's social media, aims to create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the economy over 14 months, despite his previous opposition to the sale during the 2024 campaign.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would double its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% to boost the local steel industry and decrease reliance on China. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Trump stated the move would ensure U.S. Steel's survival, reflecting on how his 25% steel tariffs in 2018 had "saved" the company. He also mentioned a $14 billion investment in the area's steel production through a partnership between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, though details remain unclear. The announcement comes amid a court battle over the legality of some of Trump's global tariffs, with an appeals court allowing them to continue after a lower court ordered the administration to halt the taxes.

          <p>North and South Korea are engaged in an ongoing information war, with the South attempting to infiltrate the North with outside information to challenge the Kim regime's propaganda. This includes using loudspeakers to broadcast South Korean pop songs and subversive messages across the border, as well as smuggling USB sticks loaded with foreign films, TV dramas, and news. Kim Jong Un is cracking down on those caught with foreign content, and new laws have increased punishments for consuming and sharing foreign media. Funding cuts from the US government may further jeopardize these efforts, potentially giving North Korea the upper hand in this information war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has decided to end funding for several HIV vaccine research initiatives, asserting that existing methods are adequate to combat the virus. This decision will lead to the closure of two major HIV vaccine research efforts at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, and will pause Moderna's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network. HHS claims that this decision is due to "complex and duplicative health programs" and the administration is advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar.

          <p>An opinion piece discusses a link between therapy culture and childlessness, suggesting that redefined standards for harm, abuse, and trauma have led to nearly impossible expectations for parenting. The author posits that Americans have expanded the categories of "harm," "abuse," "neglect," and "trauma" to include emotional and relational struggles previously considered unavoidable parts of life. This cultural shift has contributed to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, leading to a dread of parenthood among millennials and Gen Z. The article suggests that individuals are holding their own parents to unreachable standards, which they know they themselves would struggle to meet.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a doubling of foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50% and hailed a ‚Äúblockbuster‚Äù agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. Speaking at a US Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump said the tariff increase would further secure the steel industry in the United States. The announcement follows a court decision allowing his tariffs to remain in effect. Trump praised the Nippon deal, which he said would ensure US Steel remains under American control and that all steelworkers will keep their jobs, promising a $5,000 bonus for each worker.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Trump called Musk "one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced," noting his work in overhauling the federal government. Despite Musk's initial promise of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget, DOGE's efforts have saved roughly $170 billion, although some analyses suggest the actions could cost the government $135 billion. Trump indicated Musk will remain involved, and Musk said he would continue visiting the White House and serve as a "friend and adviser" to the president.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that an immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab, could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer without the cancer returning. The drug, administered before and after surgery, helps the body learn to attack the cancer if it returns. The trial showed that it doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years. This marks a significant breakthrough for patients with this difficult-to-treat cancer, with one participant saying that it has given her life back.</p>

          <p>The Army has circulated guidelines for expelling transgender troops from the military, requiring them to voluntarily leave active-duty service by June 6, after which involuntary separations will begin. The guidance instructs personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than their preferred pronoun. Soldiers are directed to identify fellow service members suspected of having gender dysphoria based on criteria including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or overt conduct differing from assigned sex at birth. The Army spokesman said, "Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex."</p>

          <p>Following a federal court ruling against President Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, the administration could explore alternative pathways, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 or Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. These options, however, have limitations compared to the broader authority granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Some experts believe Trump is likely to turn to Section 232 to further his tariff agenda, while others suggest Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 could be used for a quick, broad-based import duty.
