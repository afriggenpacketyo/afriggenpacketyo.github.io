          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, extending a pause initiated in May, as policymakers continue to flag household debt as a key risk. This decision aligns with economist expectations and follows the implementation of stricter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. While the central bank noted stable inflation and an improving economic growth outlook, it acknowledged increased uncertainties from ongoing trade talks with the U.S. and potential impacts of U.S. tariffs. Bank of America analysts have penciled in a rate cut by November, contingent on trade progress and housing policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral contenders, Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, engaged in a tense and often chaotic final televised debate, just weeks before the November 4 election. The discussion saw sharp exchanges on issues including ICE raids, homelessness, housing, and the safety of Jewish New Yorkers, with candidates frequently interrupting each other and trading personal attacks. Mamdani defended his progressive plans, Cuomo highlighted his experience, and Sliwa focused on crime, with the evening marked by accusations of political opportunism and character flaws rather than substantive policy agreement.

          <p>The U.S. military conducted two strikes against alleged drug trafficking vessels in the East Pacific over two days, killing five people and expanding its counter-narcotics strategy beyond the Caribbean. These incidents are part of a broader Trump administration campaign that has resulted in at least 37 deaths from nine known strikes since last month. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly raised concerns about the legal rationale for these operations and their effectiveness in stopping fentanyl, questioning the administration's claim of a 'non-international armed conflict' with cartels. The article notes survivors from a previous strike were repatriated, with one Ecuadorian released and a Colombian facing prosecution.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the company systematically discriminated against thousands of pregnant employees and workers with disabilities in its state facilities. The complaint claims Amazon placed workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and retaliated against them for requesting support, sometimes firing them for not meeting productivity targets. Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and assesses performance fairly. The state seeks unspecified compensatory damages, civil fines, and court orders requiring policy adjustments and five years of monitoring for the company.</p>

          <p>The identity of a key person of interest in the 1970 disappearance of three-year-old British girl Cheryl Grimmer in Australia has been revealed in parliament, using parliamentary privilege. The man, known as Mercury, was previously charged with abduction and murder before the case was dropped due to inadmissible evidence, and he maintains his innocence. Cheryl's family, present during the parliamentary revelation, has been advocating for a fresh inquiry and hopes the public identification will prompt new information to emerge.

          <p>Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa cited his height as a factor in wide receiver Jaylen Waddle's limited targets during a recent 31-6 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Tagovailoa, listed at 6-foot-1, admitted that his inability to see over offensive linemen sometimes prevents him from finding receivers, leading to Waddle receiving only four targets and one catch. This explanation comes as the 1-6 Dolphins struggle, with Tagovailoa leading the NFL in interceptions this season. Despite the team's poor start, head coach Mike McDaniel expressed continued conviction and belief in his quarterback.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making significant strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by identifying and targeting dormant 'sleeper cells' that can later spread cancer. A clinical trial involving 51 women, published in Nature Medicine, showed that after seven years, only two participants experienced cancer recurrence, a rate far below expectations. This innovative approach offers renewed hope for patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who battled aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. The next steps involve larger trials to confirm these findings and explore applicability to other cancers, marking a potential breakthrough in treatment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to deploy dozens of federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a significant immigration enforcement operation, staging at a US Coast Guard base in Alameda. This move has drawn strong condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who likened it to 'authoritarian theatrics' and an 'arsonist putting out the fire.' Local leaders, including San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, have pledged to resist militarized enforcement, taking executive actions to support immigrant communities. Community groups and civil rights lawyers are mobilizing to provide legal guidance and prepare for potential conflicts, with concerns about racial profiling and a city-wide shutdown.</p>

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was known by intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling and operated by a 'Designated Terrorist Organization.' However, UN experts have condemned these strikes, arguing that the 'use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates the international law of the sea' and amounts to 'extrajudicial executions.'

The Tony Blair Institute also called for a shift from 'Clean Power 2030' to 'Cheaper Power 2030,' suggesting measures like axing carbon taxes on gas to lower immediate bills.

          <p>President Trump's new sanctions on Russia's oil giants, Rosneft and Lukoil, are seen as a strategic 'punch to the gut' of Moscow's war economy, according to this analysis. Washington framed the action as a bid to 'degrade the Kremlin's ability to raise revenue' for the war in Ukraine, signaling a major policy shift following failed talks with Vladimir Putin. While aiming for maximum pressure, the White House acknowledges the risk of collateral damage, including potential surges in global energy prices, and is gambling that geopolitical gains will outweigh domestic economic impacts.
