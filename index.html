          <p>Canelo √Ålvarez defeated William Scull by unanimous decision to reclaim the undisputed super middleweight title. The fight, held in Riyadh, saw √Ålvarez control the pace with powerful body punches while Scull frustrated him with constant movement. Immediately after the match, promotion began for a potential fight between √Ålvarez and Terence Crawford scheduled for September 12. √Ålvarez, fighting outside of the US or Mexico for the first time, expressed dissatisfaction with Scull's boxing style, but is now focused on the highly anticipated Crawford bout.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' program, which offered citizenship to foreign investors, deeming it a mere commercial transaction that undermines EU solidarity. The court argued that citizenship requires a genuine link with the country, not just a financial commitment. Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, which generated significant revenue, and pledged to rework it to comply with the ruling. The decision has sparked debate about 'golden visa' programs, which offer residence permits for investments, and raised concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks within the EU.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased financial strain due to rising payroll taxes implemented by President William Ruto's administration to address the country's staggering foreign debt. The tax hikes, aimed at boosting government revenue, have significantly reduced take-home pay for salaried workers and increased the cost of essential goods. This has led to widespread public discontent, compounded by concerns over corruption and the lack of visible improvements in public services. The government's efforts to stabilize the economy are clashing with the daily struggles of citizens, raising fears of social unrest and further economic instability.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, signaling a potential disruption to the country's traditional two-party system. While the Labour and Conservative parties still dominate, Reform U.K.'s surge in support reflects a broader disenchantment among voters. Political analysts suggest that Reform's success could transform it from a protest party into a meaningful opposition force, particularly if it continues to energize voters with Farage's charismatic campaigning. The rise of smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats and Greens, further complicates the political landscape, forcing both major parties to compete on multiple fronts.</p>

The VOA has been largely silent since March following an executive order that placed over 1,000 employees on leave and terminated 600 contractors.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial school choice bill into law, allocating $1 billion for taxpayer-funded vouchers to help students pay for private school tuition. The legislation allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 per year, with additional funds for students with disabilities and home-schooled students. Supporters hail the bill as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats argue it will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families.

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by aggressive expansion, competitive pricing, and government support for domestic beans. The number of coffee shops has increased significantly, with much of the growth occurring in second-tier and 'new first-tier' cities. Starbucks, once the dominant player, has seen its market share decline as local chains gain popularity. The market is becoming more accessible to the masses, with President Xi Jinping promoting coffee from Yunnan province as a symbol of Chinese quality.</p>
