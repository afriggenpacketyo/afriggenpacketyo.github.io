          <h2>Yale Alumni Express Concerns Over Treasury Secretary's Role in Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>A group of Yale University classmates penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, cautioning him against enabling what they perceive as the Trump administration's authoritarian tendencies. The letter, signed by over 140 members of the Yale Class of 1984, argues that many of the administration's actions are unconstitutional and undermine democratic principles, citing concerns over data privacy, attacks on the media, and conflicts of interest. Bessent responded by dismissing the letter as a politically motivated attack from close-minded progressives, defending his service in the Trump administration as an honor. The letter echoes a similar one sent to former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in 2017. Optimism score: 45</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established to cut US government spending, asserts it has saved over $10 billion weekly since President Trump took office. However, a BBC Verify investigation reveals a lack of evidence to support these claims, with less than 40% of the reported savings itemized and only half of those having verifiable documentation. The analysis found that some of the largest claimed savings were based on speculative figures and accounting errors, leading to concerns about the accuracy and transparency of DOGE's reporting. It remains to be seen if the department can deliver on its promises of reducing government waste. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Small businesses are advocating for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, citing the disproportionate impact on their operations. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide relief, noting that smaller enterprises lack the financial cushion to absorb rising costs. Small business owners report that tariffs are already jeopardizing their livelihoods, forcing them to reconsider orders and potentially abandon entire seasons. The White House has defended the tariffs as a means to protect domestic manufacturing and foster economic growth. Optimism score: 50</p>
