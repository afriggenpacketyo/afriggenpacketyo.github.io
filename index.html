            <p>China is responding to U.S. tariffs by targeting the American services sector and implementing non-tariff measures, signaling a shift in its retaliatory strategy. These measures include widening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into U.S. companies like DuPont and Google, and restricting Boeing deliveries. Wendy Cutler from the Asia Society Policy Institute notes that Beijing is signaling it has many levers to pull, creating pain for U.S. companies. This escalation suggests a decoupling of the two economies, with both countries imposing high tariffs and restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A prominent Commonwealth Games official was found to have breached the organization's ethics code after an investigation into their behavior at a social event. The investigation revealed that the official spent an inordinate amount of time with a volunteer of the opposite sex, causing discomfort among witnesses. The ethics commission chair concluded that the official's actions denigrated the perception of integrity and raised concerns about bringing the Commonwealth Games into disrepute.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has requested a pause in the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing to review a recently completed parole board assessment. This motion stems from the brothers' appeal for clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who ordered a risk assessment. The DA argues that the court should possess the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions, citing that both parties have referenced previous reports during the proceedings.</p>

            <p>A potential UK trade deal with the US under Donald Trump is unlikely to be a significant economic driver for Britain and should be viewed defensively, according to Martin Kettle. Concerns exist about the terms of a deal, especially regarding pharmaceuticals, food products, and digital regulation. The deal risks becoming a means for Trump to assert his power, potentially making Britain a loser. Any gains from freer trade with the US would likely be small compared to closer ties with Europe.</p>
