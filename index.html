            <h2>Government Considers Nationalizing British Steel to Secure Its Future</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-09 06:55:32 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The British government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel, a Chinese-owned company, to prevent it from running out of raw materials. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy asserts that a "commercial solution" is within reach and that the company will remain crucial to the economy. British Steel, owned by China's Jingye since 2020, claims its blast furnaces in Scunthorpe are financially unsustainable despite significant investment. The government has offered financial support for a switch to electric arc furnaces, but the company rejected the offer because these furnaces cannot make virgin steel. The UK's largest steel workers union supports nationalization as a viable option to safeguard the industry and jobs.</p>

            <p>Delta Air Lines is scaling back its expansion plans for the second half of 2025 due to weaker-than-expected bookings, which CEO Ed Bastian attributes to the Trump administration's trade policies. The airline forecasts revenue to remain flat to slightly up for the second quarter, falling short of Wall Street expectations, and has delayed updating its 2025 financial guidance. Bastian noted a decline in consumer and corporate confidence, impacting main cabin bookings and business travel, although international and premium travel remain resilient. Delta's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, but the airline is now focusing on protecting margins and cash flow amid global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>This article addresses common questions regarding the impact of global tariffs and stock market volatility on personal finances, covering topics such as pensions, mortgages, and investments. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, potentially increasing costs for consumers and affecting jobs, particularly in manufacturing. For private pensions, the impact depends on proximity to retirement, with long-term investments expected to stabilize over time and fixed annuities remaining unaffected. The Bank of England is anticipated to cut interest rates further to encourage spending and borrowing amid economic uncertainty, potentially leading to lower mortgage rates.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the firing of 16,000 probationary federal employees.

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policy is largely driven by his belief that trade deficits signify economic loss, leading him to impose tariffs on countries with whom the U.S. has a deficit. This view is considered unconventional by most economists, who argue that it overlooks the benefits of imports and specialization. Trump's approach has resulted in high tariffs on countries like Vietnam and strained relationships with allies. Economists cite concerns about supply chain disruptions, workforce challenges, and currency issues as potential problems with Trump's strategy, suggesting it could negatively impact the U.S. economy.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is criticized for omitting any mention of transnational far-right extremists in its annual threat assessment, despite the documented danger they pose. This omission is seen as a reflection of Trump's past support for certain political terrorists and violence. The article highlights the history of far-right extremist attacks in the U.S. and the need to address the threat. The distortion of intelligence assessments, along with personnel decisions and funding cuts, leaves the U.S. vulnerable to attacks, and this shift in focus is seen as a serious threat to American democracy.</p>

            <p>A sound bath at a "healing" ranch in Los Angeles offers a unique experience with the unexpected addition of horses. The Healing Equine Ranch, run by Kiki Ebsen, combines yoga-informed mindfulness, breathwork, and somatic meditation with horses to help individuals regulate their nervous systems. During the sound bath, horses roam among participants, creating a calming atmosphere and facilitating a deeper connection. The practice is particularly effective for people with PTSD, as the horses' warm and sociable nature can aid in psychological and physical repair.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court's ruling allows the Trump administration to continue deporting immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act, provided they are given the right to challenge the government's claim. While hailed as a victory by both the government and those challenging the deportations, experts note the ruling leaves many questions unanswered. Immigrant advocates express concern that detainees will face significant challenges in filing individual petitions, especially if held far from family and lawyers. The ruling has sparked renewed legal action and criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who fear it will harm those caught in the process.</p>

A lawsuit filed by advocacy groups alleges that the overhaul has undermined services and caused irreparable harm, leaving millions without essential benefits. The Social Security Administration acknowledges long wait times but claims the issues predate the current administration, attributing the restructuring to a push for government efficiency.</p>

Critics argue that the system is inherently unfair and that Hochman's plan reflects an arrogance about the reliability of the legal system. Despite voters' past support for the death penalty, it is argued that the focus should be on justice, not simply following the law.</p>

The potential loss of these workers, particularly those without legal status, could lead to compromised care and bottlenecks in hospitals and nursing homes. Experts fear that anti-immigration policies will prompt foreign-born physicians and nurses to seek employment in more welcoming countries. The impact is expected to be particularly acute in home healthcare and nursing homes, which heavily rely on immigrant labor to care for vulnerable populations.</p>
