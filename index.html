          <p>President Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel to 50% during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill near Pittsburgh, following a recent agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel. Trump characterized the agreement as ensuring the company remains American, touting a $14 billion investment that would create and save over 100,000 American jobs. The United Steelworkers union, however, expressed reservations, stating they were not included in the discussions and emphasizing the need for written commitments to protect workers' interests. The deal includes vital protections to ensure steel workers keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States remain open and thriving (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration, Elon Musk lashed out when questioned about a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use. Musk dismissed the New York Times by referencing its past reporting on Russiagate, while the article claimed he used ketamine as often as once a day. Musk has publicly stated he has a prescription for ketamine, using it infrequently to manage a depressive state, and has brushed off concerns about its impact on his businesses. Musk also wrapped up his stint as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, overseeing the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

          <p>Hunter Biden was seen with his family in Cape Town, South Africa, driving a rented Toyota sedan, following the termination of his Secret Service detail by President Trump. This move came after former President Joe Biden extended his son's detail indefinitely, which is typically only provided to children of former presidents who are 16 or younger. Senators Schmitt and Cornyn announced plans to hold a Senate Judiciary hearing June 18 to look into the alleged cover-up of the 82-year-old former presidentâ€™s mental decline while in office by the media and those closest to him. The new pictures mark the first time Hunter Biden has been seen publicly since his father's public cancer announcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending a program critical to the search for an HIV vaccine, marking the latest in a series of cuts to HIV research and programs aimed at preventing the disease. The decision involves terminating funding for the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, with a senior NIH official stating that no further funding would be allocated for HIV vaccine research in the next fiscal year. HHS claims that the move aims to maximize the impact of federal taxpayer dollars and ensure proper oversight, though public health experts are alarmed by the decision. Despite the availability of drugs like lenacapavir, officials emphasize that a vaccine remains the only way to end the HIV epidemic.</p>

          <p>UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated that defence spending is projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, as the government prepares to unveil its strategic defence review outlining priorities for military and security spending. The review will recommend the deployment of new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and to control the army's own unmanned weapons. The Ministry of Defence will spend over Â£1 billion to develop technology to speed up battlefield decisions, and new money for defence will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%. NATO heads of government are set to meet next month, where calls to increase defence spending are expected.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning the public about scam websites claiming to sell rice at heavily discounted prices as rice prices soar. Complaints related to these websites have spiked since March, with some consumers reporting that rice was never delivered despite payment being made. The average price of rice at supermarkets has steadily risen, reaching a record 4,285 yen per 5 kg in mid-May, roughly double last year's level. The government's attempt to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles has had limited impact, prompting direct contracts under new farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi, aiming to reduce prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kg by early June.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying more than 70,000 pounds of pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The commercial truck hauling the honeybees overturned at about 4 a.m., and authorities advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. More than two dozen beekeepers assisted with the rescue, aiming to save as many bees as possible, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered and restored. Authorities said the road where the truck overturned would be closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee.</p>

Visitor numbers have slipped, with March seeing a 7.8% decrease and April a 5.1% drop compared to the previous year, while hotel occupancy has also slightly declined. International visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, are also fewer in number, and tourists are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic due to construction and road closures. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and city officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-Israeli backed Gaza aid plan, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has faced significant challenges and condemnation, with chaotic scenes at distribution centers. The GHF, using armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid in Gaza, but the UN said more than two million are at risk of starvation. Videos showed distribution centers overrun by desperate civilians, and GHF personnel reportedly deployed non-lethal deterrents, including smoke and warning shots, to manage crowds. Palestinians have described the operation as disorganized, citing a lack of communication, while aid agencies have raised concerns about the location of distribution sites and military control over aid operations.</p>

          <p>PBS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging an executive order targeting public broadcasting, accusing the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The lawsuit alleges the administration is committing multiple violations of the First Amendment, including viewpoint discrimination, illegal retaliation against the network, and encroachment of PBS's press freedoms. Trump signed the executive order instructing the CPB to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS," claiming the two news organizations "have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars." PBS argues that the executive order would have profound impacts on its ability to provide programming to all Americans.</p>

Japan aims for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, which has been the stance from Tokyo and the focus of the current meetings. Japan has proposed increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans, along with cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity, in exchange for tariff elimination. Negotiations are expected to continue before the Group of Seven summit in mid-June, as both sides work towards a mutually beneficial agreement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities and supporters are expressing anger over the fact that no knighthoods or damehoods have been awarded to figures in the sport in 130 years. Authorities say their players have been "poorly treated" by the honors system, while the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, added his voice, telling BBC News the lack of rugby league knighthoods "cannot be right." The leader of a cross-party group of MPs suggested the "scandal" of the lack of top honors for stars of the sport was linked to snobbery and class prejudice, while rugby union, often seen as having more middle class roots, has been getting knighthoods for more than 100 years.

          <p>The England Lionesses delivered a commanding 6-0 victory over Portugal in the Women's Nations League, with Aggie Beever-Jones scoring her first England hat-trick in just 33 minutes. Goalkeeper Hannah Hampton was the center of attention following Mary Earps' international retirement, but the Lionesses coped well without Earps, and Hampton barely had to move a muscle. The performance lifted the mood after a week of off-pitch attention, and the win came just five weeks out from Euro 2025, where they will attempt to defend their European title. The game was described as a "Friday night funfest," with manager Sarina Wiegman celebrating more than usual.</p>
