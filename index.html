          <p>House Republican leaders are advocating for the enactment of President Trump's agenda following the Senate's passage of a budget resolution. Speaker Mike Johnson and his team communicated to House Republicans that this moves them closer to their goals of reducing the deficit, securing the border, keeping taxes low, reestablishing American energy dominance, and making government more efficient. However, some House conservatives, like Rep. Chip Roy, have expressed opposition, citing concerns about the Senate's version lacking enforcement mechanisms for spending cuts, highlighting internal divisions within the GOP regarding fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Pfizer is currently involved in a class action lawsuit concerning alleged securities violations related to the Cerevel Therapeutics acquisition, impacting investor confidence and contributing to a 9% stock decline this past week. Broader market anxieties, such as fears of a trade war with China, have also negatively affected the stock. Despite positive developments like marketing authorization for its RSV vaccine in Europe and FDA regulatory news for breast and colorectal cancer treatments, the legal challenges and market conditions overshadow these achievements. Activist shareholder proposals challenging management pay also influenced Pfizer's share performance.

          <p>A viral video of fitness influencer Ashton Hall's intensely regimented morning routine, beginning before 4 AM and involving ice baths and multiple workouts, has ignited a discussion about modern masculinity. Critics question the video's seriousness and its implications for gender roles, with some suggesting it represents a shift towards a less overtly toxic but still problematic form of male self-optimization. The routine, promoted alongside Christian and puritanical values, places men at the center of the universe, waited on and served by women, reinforcing regressive ideas about gender dynamics and potentially feeding into a new wave of conservatism among Gen-Z men.</p>

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. The formula, which determines tariff rates based on a country's trade deficit with the U.S. divided by its exports and then halved, is criticized for using an inaccurately low elasticity rate. Experts from the American Enterprise Institute suggest that adjusting the elasticity assumption would result in significantly lower tariff rates, while a Cato Institute report argues that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the tariffs are higher than actual rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of over seven years for former U.S. Representative George Santos, citing a "brazen web of deceit" involving defrauding donors, misleading voters, and using lies and theft to fuel his political career. Santos is accused of falsifying Federal Election Commission filings, laundering donor money through a fraudulent consulting firm, and using an elderly woman's credit card for personal expenses. The prosecution details how Santos fabricated donations, claimed a nonexistent $500,000 personal loan, and doctored his resume to secure a spot in the NRCC's "Young Guns" program.</p>

He quickly moved Neymar and Marco Verratti out of the club, emphasizing the importance of defensive duties even for star players like Mbappe. Enrique's emphasis on structure, repetition, and positional discipline has rewired a squad previously accustomed to chaos.</p>

          <p>As U.S. consumers rush to purchase goods before President Trump's tariffs take full effect, economists caution against going into debt to beat the "tariff effect." While stocking up on some items may seem logical, experts advise consumers to prioritize their long-term financial health and avoid panic buying. With rising debt levels, it's crucial to take a measured approach and consider affordability, as the supply chain remains relatively stable compared to the COVID-19 pandemic era, diminishing the likelihood of widespread shortages.</p>

          <p>New York-based photographer Eric Kogan uses shadows, reflections, and precise timing to create optical illusions in his urban photography. Kogan seeks out unusual moments and humorous juxtapositions in his daily walks, capturing scenes like a pigeon balancing on a ghostly tree or a cloud caught in a net. His work aims to connect with viewers and evoke personal narratives through the unexpected perspectives found in ordinary cityscapes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from South Korea are poised to significantly impact the K-beauty industry, potentially increasing prices for popular products like snail mucin and sunscreen. Beauty enthusiasts are reacting with concern, as tariffs could undermine K-beauty's appeal by raising costs. The tariffs will test the strength of the K-beauty brand in the U.S., and manufacturers might relocate to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, but such a move could alter the appeal of the products.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily halting shipments of its UK-made vehicles to the United States as it assesses the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks has prompted JLR to enact short-term actions, including the shipment pause in April. The move raises concerns about the broader impact of tariffs on the British car industry, with potential job losses and reduced exports to the U.S., a key market for British-made vehicles.</p>

          <p>Parts of the South and Midwest are bracing for another round of torrential rain and flash flooding, exacerbating conditions in areas already waterlogged from days of severe storms.

The extreme weather is also affecting interstate commerce, with potential shipping and supply chain delays due to flooding in major cargo hubs. The increased vacancy rates in the National Weather Service forecast offices after Trump administration job cuts are also a concern.</p>

          <p>While global leaders criticized President Trump's tariffs, Argentina's President Javier Milei attended an event at Mar-a-Lago to demonstrate his support. Milei, who has implemented austerity measures in Argentina, seeks to align himself with Trump's agenda and has echoed several of Trump's policies. Despite Argentina being subject to a 10% tariff, Milei's government views it as preferential treatment. The Argentinian government is also seeking a $20 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, with hopes that Trump's support will aid in securing the deal.</p>

          <p>A panel on Washington Week With The Atlantic discussed the fallout from President Trump's tariff announcement. The panel noted that trade has not delivered the benefits that economists and politicians have promised for decades, particularly for blue-collar workers. While adjustments to trade policy could be one way to address this, Trump’s tariffs are “shambolic, they’re extremely high,” and “no one knows whether he’s going to take them back the next day,” according to David Leonhardt.</p>
