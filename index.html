          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new travel ban, suspending entry to the U.S. for citizens of 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and Iran, citing national security concerns due to insufficient vetting processes. The proclamation also includes partial restrictions for nationals of seven additional countries, such as Burundi and Cuba. Certain travelers are exempt, including U.S. permanent residents and athletes attending major sporting events. This policy mirrors a similar ban from 2017, which was later rescinded by President Biden in 2021, and is set to take effect on June 9. Optimism is tempered by the potential impact on individuals seeking to travel or immigrate to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Education Department has threatened Columbia University's accreditation, alleging violations of federal antidiscrimination laws and failure to address antisemitism on campus after the October 7 attack against Israel by Hamas. The department accused the university's leaders of acting with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon noted the accreditation commission's responsibility as gatekeepers of federal student aid. Losing accreditation would mean Columbia would be ineligible to offer federal financial aid, and the school is aware of the Department of Education's concerns and is committed to combating antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A climber has died after falling approximately 3,000 feet from Mount McKinley in Alaska's Denali National Park. Alex Chiu, 41, was ascending the West Buttress climbing route with two others when he fell at a spot known as Squirrel Point. High winds and snow prevented rescue teams from reaching the area until Wednesday morning, and Chiu is one of multiple climbers who have died in falls along this section of Mount McKinley's route.

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden's presidential actions, alleging that Biden's aides concealed his cognitive decline and questioning the validity of executive actions. Biden dismissed these claims as false, asserting that he made all decisions during his presidency, and Republican lawmakers are seeking testimony from Biden's former aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. This investigation builds on a Republican-led effort to discredit Biden and overturn some of his executive actions, and Trump has directed Pam Bondi and David Warrington to lead the investigation. Democrats have criticized the investigations as a distraction from current issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to halt operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide has been temporarily blocked by a U.S. District Judge following a lawsuit by Job Corps contractors. The Labor Department cited poor outcomes and safety concerns as reasons for the "phased pause" of the program, which offers career training and housing to young people. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have criticized the administration's move, arguing that it is illegal, and students are now in limbo as they face potential displacement and interruption of their training.

The order came after the family was taken into custody by ICE, and the judge cited potential irreparable harm if deportation occurred without due process. Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, is an Egyptian citizen with a pending EB-2 visa, and the family's lawyers argued that punishing them for the crimes of a relative violates democratic justice principles.

The conflicting positions have raised doubts about whether a sixth round of negotiations will occur, and the U.S. may seek increased involvement from Russia in the talks.

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation banning travelers from 12 countries and partially restricting travelers from seven others, effective June 9, citing national security concerns. The full ban applies to foreign nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, and Iran, while the partial ban affects people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, and Venezuela. Trump said the action was needed to protect the U.S. from terrorist attacks and other national security threats, and critics argue the ban will further isolate the U.S. on the world stage.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, gaining insight into feather evolution during this era. The development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds, and the study enhances our understanding of avian evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara Countyâ€™s coastline, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp. The order halts restart efforts on the operationâ€™s onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015, and Sable is now targeting August 1 for first sales due to this delay. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review, and the ruling is celebrated by plaintiffs seeking a public process. The 2015 Refugio oil spill looms large, galvanizing opposition to the project.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, raising questions about access to the medication. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, and experts say concerns are misguided, fueled by a report from an advocacy group. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, and periodic reviews have not found new safety concerns, but the latest review comes after challenges targeting the availability of the pill. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the U.S. health care system in 2023.</p>

Concerns are growing that the popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice, and the MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines.
