          <p>YouTube marked its 20th anniversary, celebrating two decades since its inception with Jawed Karim's first video, "Me at the Zoo". Analysts estimate YouTube's standalone value between $475 billion and $550 billion, emphasizing its dominance in the streaming landscape. MoffettNathanson analysts predict that YouTube is on track to become the largest media company by revenue in 2025, surpassing Disney, because they don't have to invest in content. YouTube's growth is primarily fueled by its subscription services like Premium, Music, and YouTube TV, solidifying its position as a critical driver of Alphabet's revenue.</p>

          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of his recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, the states argue that the President is overstepping his constitutional authority by unilaterally levying taxes, which they assert is a power reserved for Congress. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes highlighted the economic impact on her state, arguing that the tariffs will increase costs for Arizona consumers. The lawsuit seeks a court order to invalidate the tariffs, joining a similar suit filed by small businesses earlier this month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced significant volatility this week, driven by comments from President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding tariffs and the Federal Reserve. Initial enthusiasm stemmed from Trump's statement that he had "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, easing investor concerns about the Fed's independence. However, gains were partially pared back after Bessent downplayed speculation about unilaterally lowering tariffs on Chinese goods. This highlights the market's sensitivity to headlines and the uncertainty surrounding the White House's economic policies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is experiencing a surge, rising for a third consecutive day and heading towards $95,000, fueled by a broad relief rally after President Trump softened his stance on China tariffs and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin saw a spike in inflows, reflecting increased interest in the cryptocurrency as a hedge against market turbulence and dollar volatility. Market analysts suggest that the rally has been intensified by short sellers covering their positions, with the next resistance level around $95,000 and the key psychological level at $100,000.</p>

          <p>Scientists at UC Berkeley have created a new color, named 'olo', which can only be experienced through a specific technological setup involving lasers and retinal stimulation. Austin Roorda, an optometry professor, described the color as a beautiful, ultra-intense teal, marking a profound experience for him as a scientist. The research aims to understand how the eye and brain create color images, potentially leading to enhancements in human color vision.</p>
