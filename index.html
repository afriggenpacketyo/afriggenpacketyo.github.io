          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators, led by the UK's chief rabbi, marched through central London to call for the release of hostages held in Gaza. Protesters expressed support for Israel and voiced anger at the UK government's intention to potentially recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a concession to Hamas. The march, which had a large security presence, also highlighted concerns over rising antisemitism in Britain since the conflict began. The Metropolitan Police made one arrest for a racially aggravated public order offense, while small scuffles with pro-Palestinian counter-protesters also occurred.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in turmoil following its handling of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal genetic disorder. In 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval for a $3.2 million treatment from Sarepta Therapeutics despite internal concerns about limited clinical data. While initially praised for its nimbleness, the decision has come under fire after three patients died from liver failure in recent months. The FDA has since asked the company to suspend distribution, causing Sarepta's stock to plummet and raising serious questions about the agency's review standards.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are battling a significant blaze on Arthur's Seat, a prominent hill in central Edinburgh, during one of the city's busiest weekends with major festivals underway. The fire spread rapidly, sending large plumes of smoke across the city and prompting police to urge the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred during a particularly warm and dry summer for Scotland, which has led to multiple wildfire warnings and concerns about water scarcity. Eyewitnesses described the flames spreading quickly, forcing them to evacuate the popular tourist and local landmark.</p>

          <p>Following a trip to Israel, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Republican Rep. Rick Crawford voiced support for Prime Minister Netanyahu's plan for the Israeli military to assume control of Gaza. Crawford argued the move would be safer for the remaining hostages, who he claimed are being starved by Hamas. Gottheimer called it the "right answer" for crushing Hamas, provided the occupation is temporary and leads to a new governing structure, potentially a multinational Arab force. Their comments follow Israel's security cabinet approving a plan to retake Gaza, demilitarize the strip, and establish an alternative civil administration.</p>

          <p>The Canyon Fire, located northwest of Los Angeles, expanded rapidly due to extreme heat and dry conditions, forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The blaze grew from 30 to nearly 5,400 acres before firefighters gained significant containment with the help of more favorable weather. During the efforts, a Kern County firefighter, James Agee, was seriously injured when his truck rolled down a steep hillside and was subsequently airlifted to a hospital. While evacuation orders have been lifted, officials urge continued vigilance as high temperatures are forecast to return, and multiple other fires burn across the state.</p>

The dispute arose after Trump directed federal agencies to increase their presence in D.C. following an assault on a former staffer. Bowser argued that what the city truly needs is more federal prosecutors and judges, not a show of force or the deployment of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Police in Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, have initiated a murder investigation after a man's body was discovered in a house on Sunday. A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Authorities suspect the death may be connected to a separate, serious assault that occurred earlier the same day at St Patrick's Church, where a priest, Fr John Murray, was attacked with a bottle and hospitalized with a serious head injury. The local community has been left shocked and horrified by the two violent events, which have deeply affected residents and parishioners.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte stated that President Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska will be a critical test of Putin's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte expressed that while Ukraine must ultimately be involved in negotiations about its future, this initial summit is a crucial step to gauge Russia's willingness to engage in a peace process. He praised Trump's strategy of applying pressure through sanctions and weapons deliveries to Ukraine, which he believes has created the conditions for this dialogue.

          <p>Apple's stock recently experienced its best weekly advance in over five years, a rally attributed not to fundamentals but to a significant "short squeeze." Investors had bet against the company, citing its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, when President Trump signaled that Apple would be exempt from certain tariffs after the company pledged further U.S. investment, the stock price rose, forcing short-sellers to buy back shares and further driving up the price. This dazzling run masked negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

The political feud has intensified as Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to pass the new maps, which could give the GOP five additional House seats. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested upon their return to the state and has vowed to call continuous special sessions until the redistricting is resolved.

          <p>The Japanese practice of 'forest bathing,' or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The mindfulness technique involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the environment. Experts and practitioners say that by slowing down and disconnecting from technology, forest bathing can significantly lower stress levels and provide a powerful contrast to modern, fast-paced lifestyles. The practice can be done on dedicated trails with a guide or simply by spending quiet, reflective time in a local park or backyard.</p>

          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a strong personal brand is crucial for introverts to advance in the workplace. She defines a personal brand as what people know you for, which can be shaped to highlight talents that might otherwise be overlooked. Chan suggests that introverts can start with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build visibility without feeling overwhelmed. She emphasizes that branding isn't just online; participating in hobby groups and social events also helps shape the story others tell about you.</p>

          <p>A new biography of novelist Muriel Spark prompts a re-examination of her work, highlighting that beyond her reputation as a comic writer, she was one of modern Britain's most important religious authors. A Catholic convert, Spark's fiction was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job, and explored themes of divine will, suffering, and judgment. This article argues that she conveyed her theology through narrative form, often playing God with her characters by using literary devices like prolepsis, or revealing a character's fate early on. This technique forced readers to focus not on what happens, but on why.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Scottish politician Alex Salmond have dismissed claims made by his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, in her forthcoming memoir. Sturgeon suggests that Salmond himself might have been the "classic" source for leaking details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. Kenny MacAskill, leader of the Alba party, which Salmond founded, called Sturgeon a "hypocrite," while others labeled the claim a "fabrication." The journalist who broke the original story also stated he found the theory not credible, deepening the public rift between the two former leaders of the Scottish independence movement.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed with Adidas Originals culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches, which are made by Indigenous artisans, but was reportedly produced in China without partnership or credit to the origin communities. The criticism was echoed by Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed from social media.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska represents a significant gamble aimed at fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The summit, which currently excludes Ukrainian President Zelensky, has alarmed European allies who fear Trump might concede Ukrainian territory to secure a deal. The move follows months of frustration from Trump over Putin's lack of compromise, leading to threats of increased sanctions. This direct engagement, brokered by envoy Steve Witkoff, sidelines traditional diplomatic channels and hinges on Trump's belief in his personal deal-making abilities with the Russian leader.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements. The herb contains a substance called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously elevate blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance puts additional strain on the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including arrhythmias. The FDA has previously warned that consuming even two ounces of black licorice daily for two weeks can cause significant cardiovascular issues. Instead of supplements, doctors recommend proven lifestyle changes like the DASH or Mediterranean diets.</p>

The fatality occurred when a large tree, felled by winds exceeding 80 mph, crushed a vehicle in a state park. In the capital city of Lincoln, the high winds caused significant damage to two housing units at the state prison, forcing the relocation of inmates, though no injuries were reported among staff or prisoners. The severe weather also caused widespread power outages and damage across the region, with more strong storms predicted for the Midwest.</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple, Jason and Katie Lee, saved $60,000 over five years to quit their jobs and move with their young son to Taipei, Taiwan for a 13-month sabbatical. The primary motivation was to allow their son to spend extended, quality time with his paternal grandparents. By planning carefully, they minimized their U.S. expenses, renting out their house to cover their mortgage. The career break has been transformative, allowing them to focus on health, family, and re-evaluating their career priorities, realizing they can be happier with less income and more flexibility.</p>
