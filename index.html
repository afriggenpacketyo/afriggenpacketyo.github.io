          <p>China is grappling with a rapidly escalating obesity crisis, with projections indicating that over 65% of adults could be overweight or obese by 2030. This surge in obesity is raising concerns about the strain on the country's healthcare system due to chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. In response, the National Health Commission has launched a three-year plan promoting healthy diets and exercise, and plans to introduce multidisciplinary weight management clinics across the country. The number of overweight or obese adults in China has already surpassed 400 million, a figure expected to rise to 630 million by 2050.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imported goods represent a shift away from the free trade policies that have underpinned US economic might, according to economics editor Faisal Islam. The move is described as a return to protectionism, potentially triggering a global trade war and harming American businesses and consumers. Islam argues that Trump's policies are based on a flawed understanding of trade and could lead to a recession. He warns that the world may respond by forming new alliances that exclude the US.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging a judge's order to facilitate the return of a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Government attorneys argue that the judge lacked the authority to compel the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power in such a manner.
