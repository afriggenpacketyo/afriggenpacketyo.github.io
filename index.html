          <p>The Trump administration's plan to weaken power plant pollution standards is drawing criticism for prioritizing short-term cost savings for power plant operators over long-term public health and environmental benefits.  Experts highlight a massive disparity between the claimed cost savings and the projected losses in climate and health benefits. The EPA claims the rollbacks will save $19 billion over two decades, while previous estimates suggested the existing regulations would save $370 billion by 2040s. (not investment advice)</p>
