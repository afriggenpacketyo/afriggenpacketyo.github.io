          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 16:02:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration's termination of Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter to stand for now, agreeing to hear arguments on the case in December. The 6-3 decision reflects the conservative majority's deference to presidential authority over independent agencies. The core of the case revolves around whether the president can remove an FTC commissioner without cause, challenging a long-standing precedent. The dissenting justices argued that this move effectively overrules existing law without a proper hearing, setting the stage for a significant ruling on the scope of executive power.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have responded positively to the Trump administration's proposal to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000. In a joint interview, both tech leaders framed the policy as a way to attract the world's most talented individuals to the United States. Huang emphasized that immigration is fundamental to the 'American Dream,' while Altman noted that streamlining the process with financial incentives seems beneficial. This policy change represents a major shift for the tech and finance sectors, which heavily rely on the H-1B program to hire skilled workers, particularly from India and China.

          <p>New U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz asserted that the United States and its allies will defend "every inch" of NATO territory after Russian fighter jets violated Estonia's airspace. The warning came during the U.N. General Assembly, marking one of Waltz's first public statements since his confirmation. Estonian officials revealed the three Russian MiG-31 jets were armed and spent 12 minutes in their airspace, prompting an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting. Russia has dismissed the reports as "groundless accusations" and "Russophobic hysteria," further escalating diplomatic tensions between Moscow and the Western alliance.</p>

The recall affects various shrimp products sold between June and September 2025 across 31 states. While no products have yet tested positive for the element, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that long-term consumption of contaminated food could elevate cancer risk. The FDA advises consumers who purchased the affected items to dispose of them or return them for a refund, noting that no illnesses have been reported so far.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a 12-minute incursion by three armed Russian MiG-31 fighter jets, Estonian officials are urging NATO to adopt a more forceful stance against such provocations. The incident, described as the most serious since 2003, has prompted debate within the alliance on whether to escalate its response, with some lawmakers citing Turkey's 2015 downing of a Russian bomber as a precedent.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's order to halt construction on the Revolution Wind farm, allowing Danish energy company Orsted to resume work. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and poised to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted had sued the Interior Department, arguing the stop-work order was unlawful and issued in bad faith. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a temporary injunction, stating Orsted was likely to succeed on the merits of its case, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid inflaming a tense situation following Kimmel's comments on the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, the network decided to resume production. The suspension had drawn widespread criticism and prompted an open letter signed by over 400 Hollywood stars defending free speech and arguing against what they called government pressure on media companies, making the situation a focal point in the debate over censorship.</p>

The payout, equivalent to the remaining five years on his contract, follows his dismissal in July amid an internal power struggle and allegations of inappropriate behavior, which he has denied. Horner's tenure saw Red Bull achieve immense success, but his final months were marked by the departure of key figures like designer Adrian Newey and a decline in the team's on-track dominance.

          <p>Stephen Miran, a new Trump appointee to the Federal Reserve's board, is calling for more aggressive cuts to interest rates, positioning himself as a dissenting voice within the central bank. At a recent meeting, Miran was the sole member to vote for a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point reduction the Fed approved. He argues that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year and dismisses concerns that tariffs are fueling inflation, a view that contrasts with that of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Miran's stance signals a potential shift towards a more politically influenced monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Examining the Monthly Cost of a $100,000 Home Equity Loan After Fed Rate Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. Currently, a $100,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term at an average rate of 8.43% would result in a monthly payment of approximately $1,236. For a 15-year term at 8.31%, the payment would be around $974. While these costs are only marginally lower than earlier in the year, further anticipated rate cuts could lead to more significant savings, making home equity loans an increasingly attractive option for accessing large sums of cash.

          <p>Struggling budget carrier Spirit Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy twice this year, is furloughing approximately 1,800 of its 5,200 flight attendants. The move, effective December 1, is part of a broader restructuring effort to reduce costs and align staffing with a reduced flight schedule. The airline announced it would cut its capacity by about 25% in November, citing low demand for domestic leisure travel as consumers pull back on spending. The furloughs represent a significant blow to the airline's workforce as it navigates a challenging economic environment and attempts to emerge from bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>Mixed messaging from health officials is creating confusion for parents regarding childhood vaccination schedules. A CDC advisory panel recently delayed a vote on the hepatitis B shot at birth and voted to stop a universal recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine, leaving it to individual choice. This follows the CDC's earlier shift on pediatric COVID shots, which prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue its own stronger recommendation for the first time in decades. As some states form coalitions to encourage vaccinations, others like Florida are moving to roll back mandates, leaving parents to navigate a complex and politicized public health landscape.</p>

          <p>More than 400 prominent figures from the entertainment industry have signed an open letter organized by the ACLU in support of Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was suspended by ABC. The letter describes the situation as a "dark moment for freedom of speech," arguing that the government pressured a private company into silencing a critic. Signatories include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. The controversy began after Kimmel criticized the conservative response to the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk, which led to the FCC chairman threatening regulatory action against the network, sparking a nationwide debate on censorship.</p>

          <p>An editorial from The Guardian argues that President Trump's recent statements, such as admitting he hates his opponents, represent a dangerous subversion of democratic norms. The article contends that his administration is weaponizing both speech and state power to create a climate where dissent is treated as disloyalty and a security threat. By blurring the line between truth and lies, such as with claims about Tylenol and autism, the administration erodes public trust in institutions for political gain. The editorial concludes that this approach inverts the American model of free expression, creating a system of selective punishment that threatens open debate.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs from Original Medicare, with average monthly premiums in 2025 varying widely. Costs can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. Most beneficiaries, however, can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month for popular mid-level plans like Part G or Part N. Premiums are influenced by factors such as age, location, gender, and the specific plan chosen, making it crucial for seniors to compare options carefully to find affordable and adequate coverage.

Routh, who is representing himself, chose not to testify in his own defense. His witnesses included a former Marine sniper who testified that the rifle found at the scene was prone to jamming, and two friends who spoke to his non-violent character. The prosecution previously spent seven days presenting its case with 38 witnesses.

          <p>A BBC undercover investigation at Castlehill Care Home in Inverness, Scotland, has revealed serious care failures, prompting accusations of neglect from residents' families. A reporter working as a cleaner for seven weeks filmed vulnerable elderly residents left for hours in soiled clothing and bedding. The footage also showed a resident in extreme distress over intimate care being performed by male staff against her wishes, a result of chronic staff shortages. The home, which charges up to £1,800 per week, has been placed in special measures by regulators, and one family has already removed a relative after their own secret camera captured neglect.</p>

This marks a significant turnaround for Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light brand lost its two-decade reign to Modelo in 2023 following a conservative backlash. Modelo's parent company, Constellation Brands, has recently faced challenges, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base, contributing to the shift in market leadership.</p>
