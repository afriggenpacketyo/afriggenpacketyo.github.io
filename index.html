          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported from Maryland, has been returned to the U.S. to face charges related to transporting undocumented migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a conspiracy to transport thousands of migrants from Texas across the country over nearly a decade. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador for returning Abrego Garcia, who allegedly transported MS-13 members, and noted that he will be deported after serving his sentence if convicted. The case led to the resignation of a federal prosecutor concerned about political motivations, while Abrego Garcia's attorney claims the government played games with his client's life.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially granted a stay, allowing the Trump administration to restrict the Associated Press' access to the Oval Office and other restricted areas of the White House. The 2-1 ruling favored the administration's argument that these spaces are not public forums and the White House retains discretion over which journalists are admitted. The dissenting judge warned that this decision could erode press independence and allow for the exclusion of journalists based on viewpoint. This ruling reverses a lower court's decision that deemed the ban unconstitutional, granting the White House more control over press access.</p>

Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, conduct extensive business with the U.S. government, with SpaceX alone receiving billions in contracts. Trump has threatened to terminate these contracts, though doing so would be legally complex, and Musk's companies also face ongoing government investigations and regulatory issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to cancel a large amount of federal funding for California, potentially starting as soon as Friday. Agencies are being directed to identify grants that can be withheld, with specific consideration given to terminating federal grant funding for the University of California and California State University systems. The administration is allegedly targeting California universities over alleged antisemitism on campus. The move has been met with strong opposition from California representatives, who have vowed to fight back and challenge the cuts in court.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mark Dybul, who led George W. Bush's PEPFAR program to combat AIDS, is concerned about its future due to proposed budget cuts. President Trump has requested Congress to rescind billions in foreign aid, including funds allocated to PEPFAR. The cuts would reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases, potentially reversing gains made in countries like Namibia. Dybul emphasizes the importance of continued support to maintain progress and prevent a resurgence of the epidemic.</p>

          <p>Fresh US sanctions against judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) are drawing criticism and calls for the EU to intervene.

The order also aims to boost U.S. development and commercial use of drones.
