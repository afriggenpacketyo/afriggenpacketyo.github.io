          <p>The Walt Disney Company and Miral are collaborating to build Disneyland Abu Dhabi on Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.

The park aims to blend authentic Disney entertainment with Emirati culture and is expected to include themed accommodations, unique dining, and retail experiences.

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain its current policy due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic signals. Market expectations have shifted, with futures pricing implying little chance of an interest rate cut this week and only a modest probability in June. Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of explaining the Fed's cautious stance amid conflicting data, including consumer pessimism, business executive concerns, and solid employment figures.

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican challenger in a North Carolina Supreme Court race, conceded after a six-month legal battle to overturn the victory of Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The concession followed a federal court ruling ordering the state elections board to certify Justice Riggs's victory, which had been affirmed by two recounts. Griffin's challenge, which sought to invalidate thousands of ballots, drew criticism from democracy watchdog groups and others who feared it could set a dangerous precedent for future elections. Justice Riggs expressed relief that the will of the voters was finally heard after a protracted and costly process.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering bipartisan legislation to end penny production due to economic concerns, despite resistance from collectors. It costs nearly four cents to produce each one-cent coin, leading to calls for its elimination. While some, like Copper Penny Grille owner Shelly Gref, value the penny's historical significance and artistic potential, economists argue it's a waste of time and resources. The Kilcoyne family, who create collectible pennies, worry about their business if the coin is discontinued, but also see potential for increased value if it becomes rare.</p>

          <p>An expert estimates that federal direct undergraduate loan interest rates could slightly decrease to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, down from 6.53% in 2024-2025. Graduate student loan rates are also expected to decrease marginally, with PLUS loans for graduate students and parents potentially seeing a similar reduction. These rates are determined annually by the government and are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note. The calculation for these rates is based on the Treasury Department's announced high yield rate on Tuesday of 4.34%.</p>

          <p>Accommodation costs for asylum seekers in the UK are expected to triple, reaching Â£15.3 billion over ten years, according to the National Audit Office. This increase is largely driven by the rising number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, which account for three-quarters of spending despite housing only a third of asylum seekers. The NAO report highlights that private providers may profit more from using hotels than other accommodation types. The contracts signed by the Conservative government in 2019 with Serco, Mears and Clearsprings are now under scrutiny due to the escalating costs.</p>

          <p>Two men are on trial for allegedly chopping down the famous Sycamore Gap tree as a 'bit of a laugh,' with prosecutors arguing they later feared public outrage. The tree, a landmark on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, was felled in September 2023. Both men deny the charges, with each accusing the other of being responsible. The prosecution presented evidence including tracked phone and car movements, as well as a video allegedly showing the felling.

          <p>India's military operation against Pakistan, dubbed 'Operation Sindoor,' has drawn criticism for invoking a symbol of widowhood in its name. Sindoor, a red powder worn by Hindu married women, is removed upon widowhood, and the operation's name references the wives who lost their husbands in a recent terrorist attack. While the name is intended to signal vengeance, feminists and others have criticized its use as reinforcing traditional gender roles and potentially fueling anti-Muslim sentiment. The article explores the cultural and political implications of the operation's name.</p>
