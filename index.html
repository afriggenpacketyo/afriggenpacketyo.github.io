        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ultimate Pool in the UK has rescinded its policy allowing transgender women to compete in the women's series, now barring biological males following a championship controversy and an expert report. The report concluded that pool is a 'gender affected sport' where biological males possess competitive advantages, citing unique disadvantages for female players. This decision aligns with a recent UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' under its biological meaning, influencing the organization's policy update. The new guidelines took effect April 23, 2025, reflecting a shift towards biological definitions in sports eligibility.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained, prompting evacuations and a state of emergency declaration.

Although one business was destroyed and several outbuildings and vehicles were damaged, no injuries or loss of life have been reported.

          <p>Donald Trump is offering an 'exclusive invitation' for the top 220 investors in his $TRUMP memecoin to have a private dinner with him at his golf club in Virginia, followed by a White House tour.

The website promoting the memecoin urges investors to let the President know how many $TRUMP coins they own, raising ethical concerns about access to the White House being tied to financial investment.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has criticized Volodymyr Zelensky for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations and prolongs the conflict. Trump asserted that a deal to end the war was 'very close' but Zelensky's stance is impeding progress, while US Vice-President JD Vance outlined a vision for a deal that would 'freeze the territorial lines' near their current positions. Ukraine maintains that it will not give up Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, stating that ceding the territory would violate their constitution. Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv with missiles and drones, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that nearly half of Americans still live with unhealthy air pollution, despite decades of improvements due to regulations like the Clean Air Act. The report highlights that 156 million people reside in areas with high smog or soot pollution, which harms their lungs, hearts, and brains.
