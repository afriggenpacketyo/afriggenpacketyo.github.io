          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport due to ongoing equipment and staffing problems at the FAA, particularly in the Philadelphia traffic control center, which oversees Newark's airspace. The FAA acknowledged equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages as contributing factors to the delays. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to revamp the air traffic control system, but travelers at Newark are currently experiencing significant delays, with some flights delayed by several hours. The delays have a ripple effect on other airports, causing frustration for passengers hoping for smooth travel days.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist eligible students with private school tuition. The legislation allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 annually, while students with disabilities may receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000. Democrats argue that the bill will siphon funds from underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier students already in private education. This new law marks a significant victory for school choice advocates and is expected to impact the educational landscape in Texas.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined an offer from US President Donald Trump to send American soldiers to Mexico to combat drug cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized Mexico's sovereignty and its ability to collaborate with the US without foreign military intervention. She also urged Trump to halt weapons smuggling from the US into Mexico, which contributes to cartel violence. This stance reflects Sheinbaum's efforts to balance relations with the US while asserting Mexico's independence and protecting its national interests.</p>

          <p>An election is likely to incorporate a new city on the southern tip of Texas dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX company. Local residents are voting on incorporating a patch of land known as Boca Chica Village as a new municipality called Starbase. The creation of a new municipality would establish a local government with a mayor and two commissioners that would have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accuse the company of harming the local environment.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a law making over 5 million students eligible for private school vouchers, allocating $1 billion for the program's first two years. This legislation allows parents to use state funds for private school tuition, marking a significant victory for conservatives advocating for school choice. Opponents argue that it drains money from public schools and primarily benefits wealthier families. This law makes Texas the 16th state to offer public funds for private education to all students and is expected to reshape the educational landscape in the state.</p>

          <p>After federal officials cleared a large homeless encampment in Oregon's Deschutes National Forest, many displaced residents relocated to nearby wooded areas. The sweep, affecting 100 to 200 people, occurred due to concerns about wildfires, trash, and reports of violence. However, advocates argue that the eviction does not address the root causes of homelessness, particularly the lack of affordable housing in Bend. The displaced individuals, often living in dilapidated RVs, now face continued challenges as they seek refuge in other public areas, underscoring the need for sustainable solutions to the homelessness crisis.</p>
