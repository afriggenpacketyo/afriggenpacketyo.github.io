          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third major heatwave of the year, with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland recording their warmest days so far. Amber heat health alerts are active for southern and eastern England, warning of risks to the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. The extreme heat has led to hosepipe bans for millions, fueled wildfires in Scotland and Surrey, and is expected to break with cooler temperatures and rain early next week.</p>

          <p>After more than four decades of conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish government, initiating a disarmament process. This move, prompted by a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a major opportunity for peace, though significant hurdles remain. The PKK is demanding concessions, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms, while the Turkish government remains cautious. Analysts are optimistic that this process could improve Turkey's regional relationships and domestic stability.</p>

          <p>Construction workers installing a water pipeline in Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat buried beneath the seabed. The find was made in the historic Old Town harbor, a location famously used for filming the series "Game of Thrones." A marine archaeologist confirmed the vessel is over 225 years old based on radiocarbon dating analysis. The remains are now being protected for further examination, adding to a series of recent maritime archaeological discoveries across Europe.</p>

          <p>In response to a challenging business climate, high-end hotels in China are adopting unconventional survival strategies, such as selling low-cost street food.

While the government insists it cannot improve the pay offer, it is reportedly open to discussing working conditions. Public support for the strikes has significantly declined since last year.</p>

Araujo took a plea deal and testified that Abell led the brutal attack, which included a sexual assault, after Seiden posed an innocuous question.

          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant shift in its political landscape, marked by the rising popularity of conservative Islamic parties. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial ground, challenging the more moderate government of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This "green wave" reflects growing support for policies like stricter Islamic law, particularly among younger Malay voters. While some view this as genuine religious conviction, others see it as a political tool used to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with the current administration.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>

          <p>A new scientific study offers evidence that could counter fears in India about China's dam construction on the Brahmaputra river, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet. Contrary to concerns that a new mega-dam could cause droughts, the study analyzed data from two existing upstream dams. The findings, measured since 2014, show that these dams have actually increased water flow downstream during the dry season. Low flows in February were up by more than 50%, suggesting that dam operations are augmenting water levels when they are typically at their lowest.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied access, Florida lawmakers finally toured the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention facility in the Everglades. Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for entry, reported "appalling" conditions, including high temperatures and claims that detainees' drinking water comes from toilets. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction with the conditions. The facility was built rapidly, and authorities have denied claims of inhumane conditions, while protesters and lawmakers continue to call for accountability and hearings.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. The EU's chief, Ursula von der Leyen, threatened "proportionate countermeasures," while Mexico's president called the plan unfair but expressed hope for a negotiated agreement. Trump warned that he would respond to any retaliation with even higher taxes. The move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has recently targeted goods from Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil, escalating global trade tensions.</p>
