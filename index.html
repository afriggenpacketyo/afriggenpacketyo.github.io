          <p>An opinion piece argues that the global strategic environment is increasingly precarious due to a new multipolar arms race. The advancement and proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities, similar to the Cold War, allow adversaries to hold populations hostage under the threat of nuclear conflict. While the author notes that the current trajectory towards perpetual conflict is not irreversible, the nature of modern warfare has radically changed, increasing the scale of potential suffering and making the possibility of a major war feel more tangible.</p>

          <p>A poignant photojournalism project captures the bedrooms of children killed in school shootings, left exactly as they were. The families of eight victims allowed a reporter and a photographer to document these spaces, which serve as heartbreaking memorials to lives cut short. The parents hope that by sharing these intimate and painful images of unmade beds and personal belongings, they can convey the depth of their loss and motivate the public to seek change and prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>Beaches along the U.S. East Coast, from Maine to Florida, are under water quality advisories due to high levels of fecal bacteria just before the Labor Day holiday. Officials warn that the contamination, often linked to aging sewer systems and storm runoff, can cause illnesses like nausea and rashes in swimmers. Despite the warnings and some beach closures in popular destinations like Cape Cod and Long Island, authorities note that many vacationers may choose to enter the water anyway.</p>

          <p>This article examines the significant implications of President Trump's efforts to exert influence over the Federal Reserve, including his attempt to unseat Governor Lisa Cook. Experts warn that politicizing the central bank could undermine its decades-long independence, which is crucial for maintaining economic stability and controlling inflation. Should the president gain a majority on the board, it would grant him control over key economic levers, including bank regulation and interest rates, potentially leading to long-term economic instability.

          <p>A decade after volunteering to accept more migrants to reverse its declining population, the German town of Altena offers a complex case study on integration. While the initiative brought new life, filled empty housing, and saw many newcomers find jobs, it was not a simple solution. The town faced challenges as some migrants moved to larger cities, others struggled with cultural barriers, and a rise in anti-immigration sentiment has been reflected in recent election results, showing that migration alone was no panacea for deep-seated economic and social issues.</p>

For instance, when Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in the Trump administration's cabinet, the interviewer did not press her for names.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, illuminates the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a nearby military school, fashioned surfboards from local redwood trees and demonstrated the royal sport to amazed locals. This act of "surf diplomacy" planted the seed for the sport's popularity in America, which would later be globally popularized by Duke Kahanamoku, highlighting a significant moment of cultural exchange.</p>

For decades, the U.S. has sold arms to the island, but co-production would mark a significant escalation in defense ties, which Beijing would likely view as a major provocation.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a significant shift in the party's climate policy, pledging to remove all net zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. If elected, a Conservative government would scrap rules requiring emission reductions or carbon capture investments, focusing solely on maximizing fossil fuel extraction. This approach reverses the UK's legally binding commitment to reach net zero by 2050, drawing criticism from environmental groups who warn it is reckless and will accelerate the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly contemplating a last-minute move for Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez before the transfer window closes. The club has been seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and has also been in talks for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, Martinez, a World Cup winner with Argentina and a two-time FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year, would bring a wealth of high-level Premier League experience that the younger Lammens lacks, as United's coach acknowledged the difficulty of the position at the club.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough in the UK this year, involving a baby whose mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy. This death highlights the dangers of the bacterial infection for infants and comes amid government warnings about declining vaccine uptake. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to newborns in their first weeks of life. The case serves as a tragic reminder of the severe consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>A worldwide boom in the popularity of matcha has caused its price to skyrocket and created supply shortages, even in its home country of Japan. Driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism surge, demand for the powdered green tea has strained Japan's aging farming communities. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, has jumped dramatically, forcing retailers to ration supplies as major companies create dedicated divisions to manage the intense competition for the product.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the importance of school attendance at the start of the new academic year. The warning is backed by new data revealing that over half of pupils who missed any part of the first week of school in 2024 went on to be "persistently absent" for the rest of the year. Phillipson stressed that missing even a few days early on can set a pattern of poor attendance, which has significant negative consequences for a child's future.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval ratings have hit a 30-year low, some strategists see reasons for optimism. The concept of "negative partisanship," where voters are more motivated by dislike of the opposing party, could work in their favor as President Trump's own popularity wanes. Potential presidential candidates are actively competing to be the strongest voice against the administration, and polling for the 2026 congressional elections shows a slight Democratic advantage. The party's recovery plan involves rallying public opposition and focusing on economic issues.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece revisits Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism, arguing its relevance to the current political climate in the United States. Morrison described fascism not as a sudden event but as a series of steps, with American racism as its "succubus twin." The author contends that this historical genealogy is crucial for understanding today's challenges. The article calls for learning from the long history of Black resistance, which has fought racial fascism through belief, diverse forms of protest, and faith, offering a model for defending democracy.</p>
