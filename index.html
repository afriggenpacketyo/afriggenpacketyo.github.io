          <p>At least six people were killed in Kyiv and Odesa as Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles into Ukraine. Ukrainian air force reported that 322 'air attack vehicles' were launched, including 315 drones and seven missiles, with 277 drones and all seven missiles reportedly neutralized. President Zelenskyy stated that residential buildings and urban infrastructure were damaged, including a maternity hospital in Odesa, and called for concrete action from the US and Europe to force Russia into peace.

          <p>Meta is launching a new artificial intelligence lab dedicated to the pursuit of 'superintelligence,' a move that involves reorganizing its AI efforts under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The new lab will include Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI, indicating a significant investment in talent and resources for this ambitious project. This initiative reflects the growing importance of AI in Meta's long-term strategy and its commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities. The focus on superintelligence suggests Meta's interest in developing AI systems that surpass human-level intelligence in various domains, though the specific goals and timelines remain undefined.

          <p>Israel's Foreign Ministry announced that activists, including Greta Thunberg, who were aboard an intercepted ship attempting to deliver aid to Gaza, are being deported. The activists were taken to an airport in Tel Aviv to be flown back to their home countries. The ship, which was carrying a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid, was intercepted by Israeli forces in international waters and towed to Ashdod.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, leading to a fall in job vacancies. The number of available jobs decreased by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This weakening in the labor market is attributed to firms holding back on recruitment due to rising employment costs, including increased National Insurance Contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. Economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising over the coming year, as businesses look to offset higher costs by reducing headcount and slowing hiring activity.

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), has been charged with conspiracy to impede an officer after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. Huerta allegedly blocked a vehicular gate to a staging ground for ICE operations and resisted officers' attempts to move him. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, while SEIU officials held a protest in Washington, D.C., in support of Huerta's release. If convicted, Huerta faces a sentence of up to six years in federal prison, as the protests were sparked by ICE raids that resulted in the arrest of 44 undocumented immigrants.

          <p>This article discusses how Donald Trump's constant attacks and controversies, including sniping with Elon Musk and clashes with Gavin Newsom over immigration enforcement, keep the media in a frenzy. Trump's approach involves simultaneously managing multiple issues, such as issuing travel bans, addressing human trafficking cases, and battling elite law firms. The media's coverage of these controversies, while sometimes critical, also drives ratings and engagement. The article also touches on Trump's controversial pardons and investigations, noting how they often deflect criticism from other issues. The optimism score for this article is 50.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with tariffs imposed by the United States, Chinese manufacturers are increasing exports to Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. Shipments to Vietnam rose by 18.8%, Thailand by 20.9%, and Indonesia by 16.8% in the first five months of the year, compared to the same period in 2024. This shift allows Chinese manufacturers to supply factories in Southeast Asia, which then produce finished goods for local sale or export, including to the US. Analysts suggest that while some exports may be transshipped to avoid tariffs, factories often add enough local content to re-export goods as made in Vietnam, Thailand, or Indonesia.

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European regulations to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for other substances like salt during transit. Ketamine is classified as a legal medicine in some countries, making it easier to transport across borders and then divert into the black market. Consumption of ketamine has risen significantly, and it is linked to cognitive problems and bladder damage. Authorities are working to increase international cooperation to combat the issue, with Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office closely monitoring new psychoactive substances like ketamine.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the aim to sell the 2020 rice at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks earlier this year. The government hopes this measure will alleviate distribution shortages and lower overall rice prices, which have doubled compared to the previous year. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a massive reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z, particularly ages 20 to 29, seeing a 47% decrease. This positive trend is attributed to wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold, more readily available addiction healthcare, and less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, some clusters born between 2005 and 2011 saw a slight uptick in deaths, raising concerns. Despite the progress, the Trump administration's proposed cuts to funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis could unravel this recovery.
