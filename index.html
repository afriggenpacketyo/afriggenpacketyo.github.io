          <p>Donald Trump's former border czar, Tom Homan, was reportedly recorded by undercover FBI agents accepting $50,000 in cash while allegedly promising to help secure government contracts. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that federal officials believed they had a strong criminal case, but it did not meet the standard bribery charge criteria as Homan was not a public official at the time. The investigation, which originated under the previous administration, was later closed by Trump-appointed officials who deemed it a "deep state" operation lacking credible evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>In a recent group interview, actress Julia Roberts shared a humorous anecdote about her anxiety before meeting her "After the Hunt" co-star, Chloë Sevigny, for the first time. Roberts recalled telling her fellow cast members that she was "scared" just moments before Sevigny was scheduled to arrive at her home for a rehearsal. Sevigny, in turn, expressed her admiration for Roberts, stating she felt an immediate closeness and watched several of Roberts' classic films on her flight home after production wrapped because she "needed more Julia."</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its conflict with California, New York, and Illinois over their "sanctuary" policies, threatening lawsuits and federal funding cuts. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with immigration detainers, which request that local authorities hold undocumented migrants for federal custody. The states have largely refused, citing state laws and constitutional concerns, arguing that detainers are non-mandatory requests and that compliance could lead to liability for erroneous detentions.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three bullets were fired into the lobby window of the occupied building on Friday afternoon, though no injuries occurred. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, and it is unclear if it is connected to a protest held the previous day regarding the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. The station's parent company, TEGNA, has increased security and is cooperating with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The threat of flash flooding is set to return to the Southwest U.S. this week due to incoming monsoonal moisture, following deadly floods in California that resulted in the death of a toddler. At the same time, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is intensifying in the Atlantic and is expected to become the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not forecast to make landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine.</p>

          <p>The White House has named Mary "Maggie" Cleary as the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Erik Siebert. Siebert's departure came amid reports of pressure from the Trump administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a frequent political rival of the president. Cleary, a conservative lawyer, takes over an office in tumult over the politically charged investigation into James, which her lawyers have called an act of revenge.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's decision to recognize a Palestinian state marks a significant shift in its foreign policy, moving away from the long-held position that recognition should only come as part of a final peace process. This change was driven by a combination of growing pressure from within the ruling Labour Party, the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and similar moves by other allied nations like France and Canada. While critics argue the move is merely symbolic and rewards terrorism, the government insists it is a necessary step to preserve the viability of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>In a significant advance for fusion energy research, scientists have for the first time observed diamond capsules undergoing shock-induced amorphization when subjected to powerful lasers. By controlling extreme pressure and heat, researchers were able to collapse the diamond's atomic structure, providing crucial data on how to achieve the symmetrical implosions needed to release nuclear fusion energy. This breakthrough brings the world one step closer to harnessing a clean, safe, and nearly limitless power source that could reduce dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills designed to protect immigrants amid aggressive federal enforcement, including a first-in-the-nation law banning most on-duty law enforcement from wearing masks. The legislation is a direct response to recent immigration raids where masked federal agents detained people in unmarked cars. Other new laws prohibit immigration agents from entering nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of any enforcement activity on campus.</p>
