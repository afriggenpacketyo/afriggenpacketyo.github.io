          <p>President Vladimir Putin will not attend the peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, sending a hard-line aide instead, while President Trump also decided to skip the talks but will send Secretary of State Marco Rubio. President Zelensky of Ukraine expressed readiness for negotiations but emphasized the need for Western pressure on Russia to cease hostilities. The Kremlin stated that Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide, will lead the Russian delegation, and Zelensky said he would abide by a truce as long as Russia did, but Kyiv said Moscow broke its own truce. The US delegation is expected to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, is also expected in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant drop of nearly 30,000 last year, signaling progress in combating the public health crisis. The CDC reported declines across major drug categories and in most states, attributing the improvement to changes in the illicit drug supply, increased access to treatment, and the use of naloxone. However, public health experts caution that proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis, could jeopardize this progress. Representative Dean criticized Health Secretary Kennedy Jr. for the proposed cuts, given his own history of heroin addiction.</p>

The company claims the destruction was willful and created an evidentiary void, hindering their ability to prove Fox executives knew their broadcasts were false. This allegation comes after a New York appeals judge ruled that Fox News can access documents related to a Department of Justice investigation into Smartmatic executives.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded health care benefits starting in 2026 due to a $12 billion budget deficit.

The plan also includes a $100 monthly premium for adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" on Medi-Cal starting in 2027.

This increase is in response to what the company described as a "dire" financial situation following the destructive Los Angeles-area wildfires.

          <p>The Trump administration is prioritizing white South African refugees, reversing traditional refugee policies, after suspending the program for other refugees. This decision follows months of strained relations between the U.S. and South Africa, including the halting of foreign aid and the expulsion of the South African ambassador. Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa have been influenced by meetings with Afrikaner activists and conversations with golfer Gary Player. Critics argue this policy is driven by a focus on white victimhood and a rejection of diversity and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Residents in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, claim a jet fuel leak from the Twin Oaks pipeline, operated by Sunoco Pipeline, went undetected for months, poisoning their drinking water. Despite residents reporting the issue, Sunoco initially denied finding any contaminants, but after a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection investigation, a leak was discovered. The number of impacted wells has risen to at least 38, and Sunoco has been installing filtration systems and skimming fuel from wells. Residents are now suing Sunoco Pipeline and expressing concerns about their safety.</p>

          <p>The NTSB released its final report on a June 2023 plane crash that killed four people, citing the likely cause as "pilot incapacitation due to loss of cabin pressure for undetermined reasons." The report also identified the pilot's decision to operate the plane without supplemental oxygen as a contributing factor. Investigators believe the pilot became incapacitated while climbing to cruising altitude, and the plane continued on autopilot until it crashed in a wooded area near Montebello, Virginia. The victims were Adina Azarian, her daughter Aria, Aria’s nanny, Evadnie Smith, and the pilot Jeff Hefner.</p>
