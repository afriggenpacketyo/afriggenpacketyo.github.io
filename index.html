          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B of assault and battery in a high-profile civil lawsuit filed by a security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, had sought $24 million in damages, alleging that the musician spat on her and cut her cheek with a long fingernail during a heated confrontation outside a medical office in 2018. During the trial, which produced several viral moments, Cardi B testified that the guard was the aggressor, filming her and invading her privacy while she was pregnant. The jury took only about an hour to reach its verdict, finding in favor of the rapper and concluding the contentious legal dispute.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has forcefully rejected President Trump's comments about sending National Guard troops to Chicago, labeling the remarks as "unhinged" and vowing to resist any such federal intervention. In a press conference, Pritzker stated he would not call the president to request federal assistance and warned residents that the administration might be staging federal agents for raids in Latino communities under the pretext of fighting violent crime. This sharp rebuke highlights the escalating constitutional and political tensions between the White House and some state governments over the deployment of federal forces for domestic law enforcement, with the governor accusing the administration of deliberately refusing to coordinate with local officials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House Oversight Committee has publicly released more than 33,000 pages of Justice Department records related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The files include older court documents concerning Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as police body cam footage and interview records, though they appear to contain primarily previously public information. The release occurs as the White House faces bipartisan pressure to declassify all related files, with committee chair James Comer stating the move makes a separate discharge petition for the files unnecessary. The full extent of what will be released remains unclear.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a lethal "kinetic strike" in the southern Caribbean, destroying a vessel that had departed from Venezuela and killing 11 individuals described as "Narcoterrorists." The operation reportedly targeted members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, who were allegedly transporting a large quantity of illegal narcotics toward the United States while in international waters. This aggressive action marks a significant escalation in the Trump administration's counter-narcotics strategy and its pressure campaign against Venezuelan criminal organizations, which it has formally designated as terrorist groups. The president warned that the strike should serve as a notice to anyone attempting to bring drugs into the country.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer addressed Tuesday's market downturn, attributing the decline to seasonal profit-taking in September rather than fundamental issues with leading tech companies like Nvidia and Apple. He noted that investor anxiety is also being fueled by a federal court ruling against President Trump's tariffs and anticipation of the upcoming labor report. Cramer advised long-term investors to maintain their positions in strong growth stocks and not to overreact to single-day pullbacks, suggesting the current market behavior is a typical, albeit painful, part of the investment cycle that strong companies can weather.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is analyzed as a significant shift towards a more brash and left-wing political style. This move positions the Greens to potentially challenge the Labour Party from the left, alongside other figures like Jeremy Corbyn, by appealing to voters disillusioned with establishment politics. However, this new direction also presents challenges, including the risk of cannibalizing support from other left-wing movements and alienating more moderate, rural voters who recently helped the party win new parliamentary seats. The change reflects a broader realignment on the British left.</p>

Allen, who cast Trump in a 1998 film, praised his professionalism as an actor, a compliment Trump subsequently shared on his Truth Social platform. The article critiques both Allen and Maher for normalizing a controversial political figure, contrasting their personal anecdotes with the administration's aggressive policies. Allen later clarified that he disagrees with Trump on nearly all political issues and had voted for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

If convicted, the former president could face a prison sentence exceeding 40 years.

          <p>This article provides a detailed examination of President Trump's repeated claims that he has successfully ended six or seven wars and therefore deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. The White House identified conflicts involving Israel-Iran, Rwanda-DRC, and India-Pakistan, among others, as the basis for this assertion. However, foreign policy experts interviewed for the piece argue that while the administration helped broker some ceasefires and diplomatic agreements, several of the situations were not full-scale wars, and many of the underlying conflicts remain fundamentally unresolved. The analysis suggests the president's declaration of success is often premature or significantly overstates the U.S. role in de-escalating global tensions.</p>

Despite the public falling-out, the article notes that behind the scenes, foundational ties like the "two-way arms trade" remain intact. This leads pro-Palestinian advocates to label the government's tougher stance as largely symbolic, reflecting Australia's struggle to balance international pressure, domestic protests, and its long-standing alliance with Israel.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. The initial phase of testing in these new cities will involve human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually operate the vehicles while collecting data and mapping the areas. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to methodically roll out its fully autonomous, driverless ride-hailing service nationwide. The company already operates commercially in several major cities, including San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, as it continues to validate its technology for future driverless operations in diverse urban environments.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed legislation aims to address growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative health impacts these drinks have on children, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The comprehensive ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, restaurants, cafes, and online sales. A 12-week public consultation period will now begin to gather evidence from stakeholders before the law is finalized and implemented.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed federal charges against a tow truck driver for allegedly stealing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent's vehicle in downtown Los Angeles. The bizarre incident occurred as agents were arresting a popular TikTok influencer, Tatiana Mafla-Martinez, who was livestreaming the event to her followers. The driver, Bobby Nunez, is accused of hooking up and driving away with the government vehicle, which contained a firearm, while officers were distracted by the chaotic scene. The arrest of the influencer had already drawn significant attention and criticism for the agents' forceful methods.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. District Judge has imposed several significant penalties on Google for monopolistic practices but stopped short of the Department of Justice's most severe demands. The judge ordered Google to end exclusive deals that make its search engine the default on devices and to share some of its valuable search data with competitors, aiming to restore competition. However, the court rejected the government's call to force a sale of the popular and lucrative Chrome browser. While a major outcome, the ruling is viewed as less disruptive than it could have been, and Google is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Idaho State Police have released a 699-page document containing evidence photos from the apartment of Bryan Kohberger, who was convicted of murdering four University of Idaho students. The images reveal personal items, academic texts, and two birthday cards he received just over a week after committing the murders in November 2022. One card appears to be from his parents, while another contains a joking reference to his ego and status as a Ph.D. student in criminology. These details provide a chilling and mundane glimpse into the personal life of Kohberger during the period of the horrific crime for which he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a contract allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use Graphite, a powerful spyware tool developed by the Israeli-founded company Paragon. The software can remotely hack into mobile phones and access data from encrypted applications like WhatsApp and Signal. This contract was initially paused under the Biden administration due to concerns about potential misuse, but that hold has now been lifted.

          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be acquired by a consortium of investors for $7.4 billion, a deal that will take the company private. The acquisition is led by Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital and is the latest sign of significant consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. The sector has benefited from a shortage of new aircraft from manufacturers, which has driven up rental rates for both new and used planes. This deal will significantly expand the scale of the acquiring companies in a market that owns over half of the world's passenger jets.</p>

          <p>In a sharply worded open letter, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of actively endangering Americans' health. They condemn his policies, including restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and his recent removal of the CDC director, which they claim has fueled a crisis at the agency. Kennedy, a long-time vaccine skeptic, defended his actions by stating the CDC had lost public trust and strayed from its core mission.
