          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold interest rates steady, citing expectations of higher inflation and slower economic growth, while still indicating the possibility of two rate cuts later in 2025. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept its key borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024. The committee's "dot plot" suggests continued uncertainty among Fed officials about future rates, with a wide dispersion of expectations. Economic projections point to stagflationary pressures, with GDP advancing at a 1.4% pace in 2025 and inflation hitting 3% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Minnesota officials are facing scrutiny after Vance Boelter, now accused of killing a state representative and her husband and wounding a state senator and his wife, was previously appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board. State records show Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the board, first appointed in 2016. A spokesperson for the governor's office stated that there are thousands of volunteers serving on such boards, and the governor does not personally interview applicants. The FBI revealed that Boelter extensively planned and researched his victims, and he also visited the homes of two other lawmakers on the night of the shootings.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amid mixed economic signals. While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. The Fed's goal is to maintain low inflation and a healthy job market. The central bank expects inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, to rise to 3% by year-end and unemployment to increase to 4.5% (not investment advice).</p>

The annual list price for Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, but Gilead offers programs to reduce out-of-pocket costs.

          <p>Amid escalating conflict triggered by Israel's attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities, the possibility of a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program is being considered. Iran's Fordo plant, built inside a mountain, is a key target but is impenetrable by most bombs except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which only the U.S. possesses. A U.S. strike could trigger Iran to retaliate against U.S. assets in the region, potentially drawing the U.S. more deeply into a regional conflict.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing New York City mayoral candidate, has gained traction with promises like frozen rents, free municipal buses, and free day care. However, his policy and funding proposals are facing scrutiny, with questions raised about their feasibility and impact on the city's budget. Mamdani's housing proposals, including creating 200,000 units of new publicly subsidized, rent-stabilized housing, have been criticized for lacking historical context and understanding of the numbers. His proposal to freeze rent in rent-stabilized units also ignores the financial challenges faced by landlords.</p>

          <p>Pixar's "Elio" marks a return to original, rip-roaring children's yarns. The film follows an 11-year-old boy who is beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary take on the United Nations. The movie is not trying to reinvent the spaceship; it's after the puppyish charm of sticking your head out the window as marvels whiz past. The film's earthbound sequences boast staggeringly beautiful shots of the ocean under a night sky.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying an additional 2,000 members of the California Army National Guard to Los Angeles under federal command. The deployment was ordered despite the fact that demonstrations against federal immigration enforcement raids have largely dissipated. The total number of troops currently deployed to the LA area is 4,800. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the actions of federal troops deployed to LA at a Senate hearing in Washington.</p>
