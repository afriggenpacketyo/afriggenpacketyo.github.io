          <p>Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan stated the company is open to high-end changes such as airport lounges, premium seating, and long-haul international flights to attract high-spending customers, moving away from some of its traditional policies. This transformation comes amidst pressure from competitors and activist investors to increase revenue, as well as a drop in airfares. While Southwest has already introduced basic economy tickets and bag fees, it is now considering more luxurious offerings. Jordan specifically mentioned Nashville International Airport as a location where customers desire lounges and first-class services, highlighting the need to adapt to changing customer demands. The airline aims to implement these changes in a way that aligns with the "Southwest way." Optimism score</p>

          <p>Emil Bove, nominated by President Trump for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, denied allegations from a whistleblower that he advised Justice Department attorneys to ignore court orders. The whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, claimed Bove made the suggestion during a meeting about Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Bove, who previously defended Trump in legal cases, stated before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he has never advised anyone to violate a court order. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also refuted the allegations, calling them "utterly false" and accusing the media of planting a false hit piece.

          <p>This article discusses whether credit card users should request a credit limit increase given the current economic climate. It advises against requesting an increase for those already carrying significant debt, as it suggests an inability to manage debt responsibly. Instead, it recommends exploring debt relief options. For responsible borrowers with little to no debt and a clear plan for using the increased limit, requesting an increase may be reasonable, but the article cautions that approval is not guaranteed and may require documentation. The article emphasizes that the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and goals (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump engaged with world leaders at the NATO Summit, receiving praise from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and discussing defense spending. Trump highlighted that allies have agreed to increase spending to 5% of GDP, a key demand he had been pushing. He also commented on Spain's reluctance to commit to the spending target, noting his fondness for the country but emphasizing the need for fair contributions. This summit reflects warming relations within the alliance after months of disputes over defense spending and policies, and is a far cry from JD Vance's address at the Munich Security Conference.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters in Kenya, largely from Gen Z, took to the streets to demonstrate against President William Ruto's government, resulting in clashes with police. At least eight people were killed and hundreds injured, according to the Kenya Medical Association, Law Society of Kenya, and the Police Reforms Working Group, while Amnesty Kenya reported a death toll as high as 16. Protesters chanted "Ruto must go" and waved branches, symbolizing peaceful opposition, as they attempted to reach the president's official residence. The government initially banned live TV and radio coverage of the protests, but this decree was overturned by the High Court in Nairobi.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Iran and Israel is in place, but its stability is questioned amid conflicting reports about the impact of U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Iran asserts its nuclear program will continue, with officials stating measures were taken to prevent interruptions.

          <p>The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against the entire Maryland federal judiciary over a standing order that prevents the government from deporting undocumented immigrants for at least 24 hours after they file a legal challenge.

This action comes as courts nationwide manage a surge of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's deportation policies. The unusual nature of the lawsuit means no judge in the Maryland district can oversee the case, prompting the DOJ to request recusal and referral to another court.</p>

          <p>Ketel Marte, second baseman for the Arizona Diamondbacks, was visibly upset after a heckler made comments about his late mother during a game against the Chicago White Sox. The fan has been banned indefinitely from all MLB parks as a result of the incident. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo comforted Marte during a pitching change, and expressed his support for the player. Marte, who went two for four with a home run in the game, did not speak to reporters after the Diamondbacks' 4-1 win.</p>

          <p>A Marine Corps veteran, Adrian Clouatre, is struggling to care for his children after his wife, Paola, was detained by ICE. Paola, a Mexican national, was detained during a green card application meeting due to a deportation order from 2018 that she was unaware of. Despite Adrian's military service, ICE has shown less discretion, reflecting the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies. The family is now separated, with Adrian facing the challenges of caring for a newborn and toddler while fighting for his wife's release.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has identified robotics as the company's biggest opportunity for growth after artificial intelligence, emphasizing the potential of self-driving cars as the first major commercial application. While robotics currently represents a small portion of Nvidia's revenue, Huang believes applications will require the company's data center AI chips for training and other chips for autonomous vehicles and robots. Nvidia is working towards a future with billions of robots and autonomous vehicles powered by its technology. The company is increasingly offering complementary technology alongside its AI chips, positioning itself as an "AI infrastructure" or "computing platform" provider.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's government is facing a significant political storm over its proposed welfare reforms, with over 120 Labour backbenchers signing an amendment calling for the proposals to be scrapped. The reforms, aimed at reforming the welfare system, could force 250,000 people into relative poverty, according to the government's own assessment. Dissenting MPs are pushing for a different approach, prioritizing measures to help unemployed people find work before implementing cuts to benefits.
