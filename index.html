          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales surpassing analyst predictions, indicating continued spending by affluent consumers despite global economic uncertainties. The Swiss luxury group experienced a 7% year-on-year revenue increase at constant exchange rates, reaching 5.17 billion euros. While sales grew across most regions, Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) saw a decline, particularly in China, whereas Japan experienced significant growth due to strong domestic and tourist spending. Richemont's performance suggests resilience in the luxury sector, though macroeconomic factors continue to pose potential challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.7% annualized contraction in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in four quarters due to weak consumer spending and increased imports. The government launched an economic security clearance system, raising privacy concerns as it expands classified information to include economic security matters. Additionally, a new law now allows preemptive cyberdefense measures, obliging key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches. In other news, former Prime Minister Taro Aso will attend Pope Leo XIV's inaugural Mass, and Toyota plans to release a new EV with Subaru in 2026.</p>

          <p>An international research team conducted an extensive genetic analysis tracing human migration from Asia to the Americas, revealing that Native Americans descend from Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. The study also indicated that early migrants to South America formed isolated groups due to environmental conditions. Published in Science, the article highlights the longest human trek originating from Africa, with evidence suggesting human presence in South America dating back at least 23,000 years.

          <p>Scarlett Johansson is advocating for legislation to regulate AI companies' use of individuals' likeness and voices, citing past experiences where her voice and image were allegedly used without permission. In 2024, Johansson claimed OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman asked her to voice their Chatbot, but she declined, and the feature sounded eerily similar to her. The article details Johansson's concerns about AI's potential for exploitation and her efforts to establish boundaries. OpenAI later removed the voice and issued a statement saying it was never intended to resemble Johansson's.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than expected, primarily due to falling exports and the potential impact of U.S. trade policies. The article notes that the decline highlights Japan's vulnerability, with stagnant consumption and an aging population adding to economic challenges. Despite efforts to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., uncertainty persists, and economists suggest the possibility of a recession depending on the pressure from tariffs. The Japanese central bank had gradually hiked rates, but an economy still lacks a driver of growth given weakness in exports and consumption.</p>

          <p>A large dark patch has appeared off the coast of Rio de Janeiro near Barra da Tijuca Beach, with Reuters drone shots revealing brownish water contrasting with the ocean's blue. Biologist Mario Moscatelli explained that the stain is linked to urban growth and inadequate sanitation, causing sewage to flow into rivers, lagoons, and eventually the sea. The discoloration is likely due to cyanobacteria, a type of algae that thrives in unhealthy conditions with high sewage content.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets due to President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest monthly net inflow since 1996. This shift was attributed to changing investor outlooks on the U.S. economy, prompting diversification towards Japan. However, with the U.S. softening its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored, potentially impacting future inflows into Japanese markets.</p>

          <h2>Japan Enacts Law Allowing Preemptive Cyberdefense Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 00:58:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's parliament enacted a law enabling preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The "active cyberdefense" law requires key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. This change aims to establish a legal framework to counter cyberattacks following recent threats against airlines and banks. The government intends to fully implement these measures by 2027, reflecting Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The gross domestic product data was poorer compared to the 0.1% contraction expected by economists. Exports fell 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, shedding 0.8 percentage points off the GDP as uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy. Domestic demand, however, was a bright spot, growing 0.6% in the same quarter and adding 0.7 percentage points to the GDP.</p>
