          <p>A new poll indicates that President Trump's job approval rating has hit a historic low for a president at his 100-day mark, driven by widespread disapproval of his policies and economic discontent. The poll reveals that a majority of voters believe Trump's economic policies will likely cause a recession, with many expressing concern over rising prices and the impact of tariffs. While Trump maintains trust over Democrats in Congress regarding national issues, negative assessments extend beyond the economy, with concerns about his administration's respect for the rule of law and expansion of presidential powers. Despite these challenges, Trump retains strong support among Republican voters, though his approval has slipped among some key demographic groups.</p>

          <p>As stock and bond markets experience volatility, dividend stocks are gaining traction among investors seeking income and stability. While dividend stocks have always been popular, they are now more attractive as a balance between equity growth and yield. There are over 100 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, with actively managed ETFs like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF (TDVG) aiming to identify high-quality dividend payers for better capital appreciation and yield. Although tech stocks can't be avoided entirely, dividend ETFs offer exposure to the sector's biggest dividend payers without overweighting tech like the S&P 500 Index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's coastguard has reportedly seized a small sandbank in the South China Sea, escalating tensions with the Philippines, who also claim the territory. Chinese state media released images of officers on Sandy Cay, near a Philippine military outpost, asserting China's maritime control. The White House expressed deep concern over the reports, warning that such actions threaten regional stability and violate international law. This move coincides with joint military drills between US and Philippine forces, which China has criticized as provocative, further heightening tensions in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>A senior ANC figure defended South Africa's sovereignty amid growing tensions with the US over race relations and a new land law. The tensions stem from US President Trump's criticism of South Africa's expropriation law and his offer for Afrikaners to be admitted to the US as refugees. Mantashe criticized South African citizens who have called on Trump to "punish" the country. South Africa has appointed a special envoy to Washington to ease tensions.</p>
