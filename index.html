          <p>Israel's plan to capture more land in Gaza and relocate thousands of civilians has intensified the sense of hopelessness among Palestinians, many of whom have already been displaced multiple times since the war began. The displacement plan would worsen the already dire humanitarian situation, with hunger soaring due to Israel's blockade on aid supplies. Displaced Palestinians express their deep fear and resistance to further evacuations, citing death, humiliation, and homelessness. The article highlights the severe challenges faced by Gazan civilians, including food shortages and the constant struggle for survival, as the conflict continues and cease-fire negotiations remain stalled.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, anticipating a reduction in competition from copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter net profit rise, but also a lower-than-expected sales of its flagship obesity drug due to alternative versions impacting its U.S. market share. The FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling is expected to eliminate compounded versions, allowing sales to pick up again. The company is also partnering with telehealth providers to lower Wegovy costs and provide a trusted alternative for patients.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed analyst expectations, but the company's revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing shares to decline. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, along with a net income of $1.78 billion. Uber's largest business segments, including ride-hailing and food delivery, experienced growth in bookings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized the company's focus on autonomous vehicles, noting the successful launch of robotaxi services in Austin, Texas, and partnerships with various AV companies for ride-hailing and freight services.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in an effort to combat driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. This change aims to attract younger recruits and replace a growing number of retiring drivers. Union Aslef supports the move, stating it will provide opportunities for school and college leavers, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board assures that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government anticipates that new job and apprenticeship opportunities for 18-year-olds could be available as early as December.</p>

The airport attack was in response to a Houthi ballistic missile strike near Ben-Gurion International Airport, outside Tel Aviv, on Sunday. The United States has lent its military support to Israel in the conflict, launching missile strikes against Yemen and deploying its aircraft carriers to protect shipping.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance.

By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments.</p>

          <p>Xi Jinping began his state visit to Russia by thanking Moscow for supporting Taiwan’s reunification with mainland China. In a signed article, Xi framed its stance on Taiwan as a part of the post-war international order that must be upheld. The visit comes as Beijing and Washington prepare for their first face-to-face trade talks since the announcement of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2.

          <p>China is attempting to portray itself as a responsible actor in its trade dispute with the United States by agreeing to meet with American officials to discuss trade. The Chinese government said it had come to this decision “based on a full consideration of global expectations, China’s interests and the calls of American industry and consumers,” suggesting that it was doing so largely for the greater good. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expected the meeting with Chinese officials in Switzerland to focus on de-escalation rather than any major deal.

Opposition parties have criticized the exemption, claiming it could make Indian workers cheaper to employ than British workers.
