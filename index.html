          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly voiced private dissatisfaction with some of his Supreme Court picks, particularly Justice Amy Coney Barrett, believing they aren't sufficiently supportive of his agenda. Allies have echoed these sentiments, criticizing Barrett's perceived weakness. Trump aims to nominate judges mirroring Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and the late Antonin Scalia. Despite private complaints, Trump has publicly defended Barrett and criticized Leonard Leo, who advised him on judicial nominations during his first term. The administration maintains that Trump respects the Supreme Court's role, even when disagreeing with rulings. Optimism for the future of the court is uncertain given the tension.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with allegedly smuggling the fungus "Fusarium graminearum" into the United States, which the Justice Department classifies as a potential agroterrorism weapon. Officials claim Jian and Liu were receiving Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. The complaint alleges Jian's electronics contain information describing her membership in and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. Liu admitted to smuggling the fungus through Detroit Metropolitan Airport for research at the University of Michigan, where Jian worked. The University of Michigan has condemned any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security, or undermine the university's mission.</p>

The lawsuit claims Habba acted politically and made defamatory remarks about the case on social media. Baraka's attorneys are seeking damages for his alleged false arrest and malicious prosecution.

          <p>The Navy is considering renaming the USNS Harvey Milk, a ship named after the gay rights pioneer, and may also change the names of other vessels honoring civil rights leaders and Supreme Court justices. This decision is reportedly driven by a desire to realign the U.S. military with the Trump administration's priorities of reestablishing a "warrior culture." The documents obtained by CBS News show proposed timelines for rolling out the name change of the USNS Harvey Milk to the public. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries condemned the potential renaming as a shameful erasure of those who fought for equality. The name change would follow two base renamings Hegseth directed earlier this year to reverse the work a congressionally mandated naming commission did to remove names honoring the Confederacy.</p>

The current hourly minimum wage in Los Angeles is $17.28, higher than the state's.

He emphasizes that China is not neutral and has been diplomatically, economically, and militarily supporting Russia.

          <p>A commencement speech delivered at Harvard University by Yurong “Luanna” Jiang has ignited a debate in China about the barriers to elite education. Jiang's speech called for global unity, but some internet users have questioned the lack of access for ordinary students to prestigious universities. Critics have pointed to Jiang's privileged background and questioned whether she represents the broader Chinese student population. Her volunteer experience, linked to her father's position, has also been scrutinized. The debate highlights the challenges and inequalities in accessing elite education.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the possibility of civil war in Europe, drawing comparisons to the United States. While skeptical about a civil war in the US, the author suggests that the European landscape may be different. Tensions between natives and new arrivals are common, and ethnic and religious differences arguably loom larger in Europe. The author writes that the governments have been more successful than American elites at keeping populist forces out of power, but their tools have markedly diminished their own legitimacy among discontented natives. The article poses questions about the stability of European societies.</p>
