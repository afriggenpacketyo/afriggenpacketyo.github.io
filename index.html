          <p>The British-flagged superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily in August 2024, has been recovered by salvage crews. The yacht sank during a violent storm, resulting in the deaths of U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter, and five others; fifteen people survived. The vessel was raised from a depth of 165 feet, with the operation requiring specialized divers and equipment. The yacht will be transported to Termini Imerese for investigation into the cause of the sinking, with a British report suggesting extreme wind as the cause. The interim report indicated that wind speeds exceeded 70 knots, causing the vessel to overturn rapidly. </p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, despite holding no official government position, has reportedly played a significant role in President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential strike against Iran. Bannon allegedly advised Trump that Israeli intelligence could not be trusted and that the "bunker-buster" bomb might not be effective. Other advisors, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have also influenced Trump's stance on Iran, with some advocating for military action and others urging non-intervention. The situation has drawn comparisons to faulty intelligence in Iraq, with officials disagreeing on Iran's nuclear capabilities. The decision comes amid rising tensions and debate over how to handle Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>A former FBI agent is warning parents about the dangers of a sophisticated online criminal network known as "764" that targets children. The group, which originated around 2021, uses social media and gaming platforms to coerce minors into filming violent or sexual acts, which are then used for extortion. The FBI is investigating at least 250 subjects tied to the network, which promotes self-harm and suicide among its victims. Parents are advised to monitor their children's online activities, look for signs of secrecy or behavioral changes, and maintain open communication about online safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave impacts the U.S., experts suggest that American sunscreens may not be as effective as those available in other countries, particularly in blocking UVA rays. This is attributed to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved new UV-filters for sunscreen in over 20 years. Countries like France and South Korea have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists still stress the importance of wearing sunscreen daily with an SPF of 30 or higher. The FDA maintains that many sunscreens available in the U.S. provide excellent broad-spectrum coverage. </p>

He argues that Trump needs to believe Iran has the capacity and intent to develop a nuclear weapon to justify military action.

The women in the portraits wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and speaking publicly about the disease. The images aim to highlight the disease's impact on women's sexual and reproductive health and the stigma associated with its STD-like symptoms. The work was supported by the End Fund, a philanthropy that works to prevent the spread of neglected tropical diseases.</p>

          <p>Recent assassinations targeting senior Iranian military officials, including Saeed Izadi and Behnam Shahryari, suggest a growing breach within Iran's intelligence community. Izadi, a Quds Force commander, was reportedly killed in Qom, while Shahryari was assassinated in a drone strike. These incidents follow a wave of arrests and accusations of spying for Mossad, leading to increased security measures, including restrictions on smartphone use for protection personnel. Israel has been engaged in a covert conflict with Iran for over two decades, characterized by sabotage, cyber-attacks, and targeted killings. Human rights groups fear that the authorities may be using accusations of espionage as a pretext to arrest anyone who opposes the government or criticises the IRGC and the country's leadership.</p>

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by parents from various religious backgrounds, challenging the law's constitutionality under the First Amendment. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in other states, including Arkansas and Texas.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic examines Iran's potential strategy in response to President Trump's wavering stance on military intervention. The article suggests Iran might absorb Israeli strikes, enlist Russia's help to dissuade Trump, and agree to negotiations while delaying any real progress. This strategy would exploit Trump's aversion to accountability and his deference to Putin. The article argues that Trump has not taken necessary steps to prepare for war, including seeking congressional authorization or rallying allies. It concludes that Trump's hesitation stems from a recognition of his inability to unify the nation, leaving the U.S. in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>Senior Israeli officials suggest their military campaign against Iran could lead to regime change, which would have significant implications for global oil prices. Despite ongoing conflict, the oil market has remained relatively stable, but analysts warn that a prolonged conflict could disrupt supplies and cause prices to spike. Israel's primary goal is to degrade Iran's nuclear program, but a secondary goal appears to be destabilizing the regime to encourage internal opposition. Historically, regime changes in major oil-producing countries have led to significant price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a patient with a failing heart and an LVAD, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address high antibody levels that increased the risk of organ rejection. The liver transplant was performed alongside the heart transplant to lower the risk of rejection, a solution that had not been attempted before in someone with an LVAD. After a long recovery, Baker resumed her life, but faced tragedy when her husband died suddenly. Despite financial challenges, Baker hopes her participation in the surgery will pave the way for more patients to receive lifesaving treatment.

The mission achieved a fully home-grown hardware-software solution, offering a new option for spacecraft operating systems. Following the Lianli mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in small satellites.
