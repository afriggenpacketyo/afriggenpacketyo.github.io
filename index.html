          <p>Walmart reported a dip in first-quarter profits, signaling that it will need to raise prices due to the increased costs associated with tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Despite this, the retailer posted solid sales growth, with U.S. comparable sales up 4.5% and e-commerce sales rising 22%. The company is attempting to mitigate the impact of tariffs by sourcing two-thirds of its merchandise in the U.S., but CEO Doug McMillon stated that the magnitude of the tariffs would necessitate price increases, despite efforts to absorb costs. Walmart's performance is closely watched as an indicator of consumer sentiment and the broader impact of tariffs on the retail sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is endorsing U.S. President Donald Trump's proposition to elevate NATO members' defense spending target to 5% of their GDP, according to German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. While NATO chief Mark Rutte suggested a 3.5% GDP commitment to defense and an additional 1.5% to broader security, Wadephul indicated alignment with Trump's higher target. This move reflects Germany's increasing focus on defense, demonstrated by recent changes to debt rules to facilitate greater military expenditure. Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized Germany's ambition to become the strongest military power in Europe, signaling a significant shift in the country's defense posture.</p>

Trump had previously urged Ukraine to meet with Russia immediately to determine the possibility of a deal.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird living in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that the Interior Department made an error when listing the bird under the Act. This move is seen as prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as the bird's habitat overlaps with these industries. If successful, this delisting could signal that no endangered species is safe, especially those living where fossil fuels are buried, potentially impacting grassland ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding the legality of nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block Trump administration policies. This case stems from an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, a policy that was swiftly halted by federal judges. The Trump administration contends that such injunctions prevent the executive branch from even preparing to implement policies. A ruling to limit these injunctions could significantly alter how federal courts handle challenges to presidential actions, potentially bolstering executive power. This New York Times article underscores the significance of the case, marking the first time the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on a Trump policy since his return to office.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' according to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, after experiencing stronger-than-anticipated growth in the first three months of the year. The economy grew by 0.7% from January to March, surpassing the forecast of 0.6%, fueled by increased consumer spending and business investment. This data reflects the period prior to the implementation of US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes in April, with analysts cautioning that this growth rate may not persist.

Influenced by white victimhood narratives, the administration has halted foreign aid to South Africa and prioritized Afrikaner refugees, while expelling the South African ambassador.

          <h2>Walmart CFO Warns of Potential Price Hikes Due to Tariffs Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that price increases due to tariffs could begin later this month, even after the retailer reported better-than-expected earnings. Despite exceeding expectations for earnings per share, Walmart fell slightly short of quarterly sales estimates. The company has maintained its full-year forecast, but Rainey emphasized that tariffs remain 'still too high,' potentially impacting consumers. Walmart's ability to navigate the uncertain economy is aided by its position as the nation's largest grocer and its focus on value, attracting a broader range of customers.</p>

This stance comes after Germany's domestic intelligence agency classified the AfD as a 'confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor,' a decision currently under legal appeal. Despite the AfD's polling around 20%, major German parties refuse to form coalitions with the party, highlighting the divisive nature of the issue.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's nominee to lead OSHA, David Keeling, is raising concerns that federal heat protections for workers will be derailed, especially as the U.S. anticipates another potentially record-breaking hot summer.

While OSHA began working on a federal heat standard in 2021, corporations have lobbied against the rules, and Keeling's appointment could hinder progress.

The ISC attributes the surge to a 'triple whammy' of VAT, national insurance changes, and the end of charitable business rates relief.
