            <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court upheld a lower court order, acknowledging the deportation was illegal because Garcia had a withholding order against removal to El Salvador. While directing the lower court to clarify its order's scope, the Supreme Court emphasized the administration's responsibility to share information about steps taken for Garcia's return. This decision highlights the complexities of immigration law and the potential for errors in deportation processes.</p>

            <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny and accusations of manipulating stock markets after a series of social media posts and tariff policy changes. Following a post urging people to buy stocks, Trump announced a pause on tariffs, causing the market to surge. Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts are calling for investigations into whether Trump deliberately manipulated the markets or enabled insider trading. A former ethics lawyer for George W. Bush stated that similar actions in previous administrations would have resulted in termination. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A pioneering child development study is tracking babies' brains to understand how key skills develop. Researchers are using specially designed games and brain-scanning 'hats' to measure inhibitory control, working memory, and other abilities in children aged six months to five years. This project is unique because it also has data on the mothers of the children who are participating in the study, going back to the 1990s. The findings could help scientists support children who might struggle academically or socially before they start school.</p>

            <p>A British man was shocked to discover his forearm tattoo, a clock face showing his daughter's birthdate, featured in a US government document used to identify members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). The tattoo was included in a set of images for "detecting and identifying" TdA members, despite the man having no connection to the group. The US government has not deported anyone based on tattoos alone, but officials are employing a points-based system where tattoos can contribute to a determination of gang affiliation.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending an additional measles vaccine shot for some travelers within the United States due to record outbreaks. The CDC advises that visitors to areas with ongoing community-wide measles transmission should follow stepped-up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities. This particularly applies to adult and teen travelers to certain counties in Texas and Kansas, where updated recommendations include a second dose if they have only received one previously. This decision comes after more than 600 measles cases have been reported across at least 21 states this year.</p>

            <p>A new type of drug, capivasertib, has been approved for use on the NHS in England to treat a common kind of advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials have shown that it can slow the progression of the disease and shrink tumors in some patients. The drug works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT, which drives cancer growth. Trials showed that when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months.</p>

            <p>Phil Mickelson, a three-time Masters winner, faced a less-than-warm reception at Augusta. Jack Nicklaus commented on Mickelson's diminished presence on the PGA Tour. Mickelson's performance has been inconsistent since joining LIV, and his recent social media activity has drawn criticism. He shot a three-over par round, struggling around the greens, and received muted reactions from the patrons. Mickelson was paired with Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, a role Mickelson was once expected to fill.</p>
