          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys, conceded the election. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls indicated strong and consistent support for Connolly, a former barrister known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. The Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but Connolly's victory, backed by several left-leaning parties, is seen by some as a potential catalyst for a unified alternative in the next general election. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms.</p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that more than one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold at a loss, with median prices per square foot remaining flat over the last decade. This trend starkly contrasts with the rest of the country, where home prices have risen substantially. Analysts attribute Manhattan's stagnant market to factors like tax deduction caps and migration patterns, though the luxury market of properties over $10 million has continued to see profits. The data suggests a 'lost decade' for many property owners in the borough. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that a new Los Angeles art exhibit, which displays removed Confederate statues in altered or mutilated forms, is an act of 'barbaric desecration' rather than respectful historical debate. The author contends that the show, titled ‘Monuments’, is not a critique of the Confederacy but a mean-spirited mockery aimed at anyone who believes historical monuments should be protected. The piece compares the exhibit to the Nazi's 'Degenerate Art Exhibit' of 1937, describing it as a ritual humiliation intended to provoke and divide, rather than to foster understanding of history.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has begun for two closely watched races: the New York City mayoral election and the New Jersey gubernatorial contest. In New York, voters are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo. The New Jersey race features Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. These off-year elections are considered potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of progressive versus moderate candidates and highlighting issues of affordability and internal party divisions ahead of future national contests.</p>

The reports emphasize that Xi played a 'decisive role' and invested a significant amount of effort into overseeing and guiding the plan's formulation. This framework was reportedly based on extensive investigations during Xi's tours across China and underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee.

This diplomatic approach follows a period of frustration for Trump, as a previous summit with Putin failed to produce a ceasefire and new U.S. sanctions were recently imposed on Russian oil companies. However, the prospect of Chinese assistance is uncertain, given that Beijing remains Moscow's most crucial international ally.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is urging parents to get their children vaccinated against the flu, as data shows an early start to the flu season with rising cases and hospitalizations, particularly among children. Health officials are using the half-term school break as an opportunity for children who missed the vaccine at school to get it at GP surgeries or pop-up clinics. Most children are offered a nasal spray vaccine instead of an injection. Officials warn that flu can spread rapidly in schools and vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent serious illness.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending all of their children's sports practices, arguing that their absence can foster resilience and internal motivation. She suggests that without a parent watching from the sidelines, children are less likely to feel nervous or 'outsource their motivation,' allowing them to play more freely and take risks. Wambach believes this approach helps children become self-starters, a crucial trait for success in adulthood. When attending games, she recommends focusing on acts of leadership and teamwork rather than the final score.</p>

The piece suggests the move is driven by ego and raises concerns about whether Trump intends to adhere to presidential term limits, given the scale of a project he may not enjoy.

However, Caracas fears the move is a pretext for an intervention aimed at overthrowing Maduro's government, which the U.S. does not recognize as legitimate.
