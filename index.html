          <p>The UK government is developing a list of US products for potential retaliatory tariffs, responding to President Trump's new import taxes.  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is consulting with UK firms to determine which products would be most effective.  The government's list covers 27% of US imports, aiming for minimal economic impact on the UK.  This action underscores the UK's determination to secure a favorable trade deal with the US, while also demonstrating a willingness to defend its economic interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new reciprocal tariffs, while appearing logically consistent, are likely to backfire, causing unintended negative consequences.  The tariffs are not based on actual trade barriers and offer no clear path for removal, potentially leading to a global trade war.  Retaliatory measures from other countries are expected, resulting in higher prices for consumers and harming American businesses. This analysis suggests the tariffs are unlikely to achieve their stated goals and may significantly damage the US economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports is significantly impacting major US retailers and brands that rely heavily on Vietnamese manufacturing.

          <p>The Trump administration issued an executive order mandating the use of electronic payments for all IRS transactions by late September 2025.  This aims to improve efficiency and reduce fraud associated with paper checks.  The order directs the IRS to stop issuing paper checks for tax refunds and requires electronic payments for tax bills.  This change may pose challenges for taxpayers without bank accounts or access to electronic payment systems, necessitating exceptions for certain individuals and situations.</p>
