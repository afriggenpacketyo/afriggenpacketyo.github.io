          <p>A federal judge in Vermont ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral candidate, from immigration custody after her student visa was revoked. The judge, William K. Sessions III, cited concerns that her detention violated her First Amendment rights, as it appeared to be in retaliation for an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's actions in Gaza. The judge stated that the government presented no evidence other than the op-ed to justify her detention, raising substantial constitutional concerns about suppressing free speech. Ozturk, who had been detained for over six weeks, alleged she suffered multiple asthma attacks due to unsanitary conditions in the Louisiana detention center. The article highlights the ongoing debate regarding the balance between national security and freedom of expression for international students.</p>

          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the classic 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer suitable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing longevity. He emphasizes that with people living longer, investment strategies must adapt to ensure individuals don't outlive their savings. Edelman suggests investors should allocate a higher percentage of their portfolio to equities, around 70% to 80%, to achieve adequate financial security for potentially longer lifespans. He also highlights the rising healthcare costs in retirement, necessitating a more aggressive investment approach to combat longevity risk.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain free from immigration custody while he challenges his detention, denying the Trump administration's request to re-detain him. Mahdawi's lawyers argue he was detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, violating his First Amendment rights, while the administration claims it has the right to revoke visas for those posing "adverse foreign policy consequences." Mahdawi, born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union.

          <p>President Trump is set to announce a "most favored nation" plan aimed at cutting Medicare drug prices, according to sources. This plan, previously attempted during his first term, would tie the prices of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal due to court orders and stakeholder concerns. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary, has pointed to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic as justification for the policy's return.</p>

          <p>Mexico is suing Google for referring to the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America" on Google Maps for US users. President Claudia Sheinbaum says Google has ignored repeated requests to change the name, which originated from a decree issued by the Trump administration. Sheinbaum argues that the U.S. lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf, and the change only applies to the US portion of the continental shelf. Google has stated it made the change as part of "a longstanding practice" of following name changes when updated by official government sources.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed in federal court seeking to undo the 624,000-acre Chuckwalla National Monument in the Southern California desert, claiming President Biden overstepped his authority. The suit argues that the Antiquities Act, used to create the monument, limits monuments to the “smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.” Plaintiffs, including a miner and a recreation access group, claim the designation will restrict their land use. Supporters argue the law has long been used to protect large land masses and that the monument safeguards tribal lands and wildlife habitat.</p>
