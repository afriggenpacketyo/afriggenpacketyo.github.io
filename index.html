          <p>As a jury deliberates in Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs‚Äô federal trial, legal experts are weighing the potential consequences for his estimated $400 million fortune. A conviction on racketeering and sex trafficking charges could lead to the forfeiture of assets directly linked to the crimes, such as a private jet if it was used in the illegal enterprise. Beyond criminal penalties, a guilty verdict would likely bolster civil lawsuits against him, while even an acquittal could significantly harm his earning potential and brand reputation within the music industry.</p>

          <p>Police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, arrested two people after finding 383 embalmed but uncremated corpses piled up in a private crematorium. Authorities allege the grisly discovery was a result of negligence, with some remains potentially having been there for up to two years while relatives were given other materials instead of ashes. The find highlights the broader crisis facing Mexico's forensic system, which is overwhelmed by high body counts and limited resources amid widespread organized crime violence. Forensic officials are now working to identify the deceased.</p>

          <p>Karen Kneller, the chief executive of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), has resigned following months of intense criticism over the organization's handling of wrongful conviction cases. Her departure was prompted by the CCRC's admitted "failing" of Andrew Malkinson, who spent 17 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. A justice select committee had called for her to go, citing the organization's inability to learn from its mistakes, marking the second high-profile resignation at the embattled body this year.</p>

          <p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate-passed version of President Trump's budget bill contains over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. These reductions, driven by a new national work requirement and limits on state provider taxes, are projected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance by 2034. Healthcare advocates also warn that the significant loss of federal funding could force the closure of many rural hospitals that depend heavily on Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, alongside top officials, toured a new migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, provocatively nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The visit served as a calculated display of the administration's hardline immigration policies, with Trump praising the intimidating nature of the facility. Critics and immigrant rights groups have condemned the center for its harsh conditions, including extreme heat and its location in a remote marshland, seeing the event as a celebration of authoritarian and dystopian tactics.</p>

          <p>An end-of-term analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court reveals significant wins for social conservatives and the Trump administration. The court's Republican majority issued key rulings that permit states to block gender-affirming care, create new religious opt-outs for public school lessons, and weaken federal Medicaid law. Concurrently, the court has frequently used its expedited "shadow docket" to reinstate Trump administration policies that were blocked by lower courts, effectively treating the executive branch as a special beneficiary of the law.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's record-breaking gains with Latino voters in the 2024 election, a new analysis suggests his administration's current aggressive immigration raids may be reversing that progress. The article argues that the indiscriminate nature of the raids, which have swept up non-criminals and long-term residents, is creating widespread fear and anger. This dynamic is drawing comparisons to the political fallout from California's Proposition 187 in the 1990s, which drove a generation of Latino voters away from the Republican Party.</p>
