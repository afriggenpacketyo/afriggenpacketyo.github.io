          <p>Women's lacrosse star Charlotte North revealed her pre-game superstitions, including a specific playlist featuring Dropkick Murphys' "I'm Shipping Up to Boston," which she listened to before every game while at Boston College. North, the NCAA's all-time leading goal scorer, transferred from Duke and led Boston College to the 2021 national championship, attributing some of her success to these rituals. She also played on the USA women’s national lacrosse team that won gold at the World Lacrosse championships in July 2022, and on Team 1, the first ever USA women’s national box lacrosse team, winning gold at the World Lacrosse women’s box championships in September 2024.

          <p>The Trump administration has sued Colorado and Denver, accusing them of impeding federal immigration enforcement through sanctuary policies. The lawsuit challenges state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration agencies, including restrictions on holding detainees and sharing information. Governor Jared Polis and Mayor Mike Johnston are named as defendants in the suit, which seeks to overturn the laws as unconstitutional. The administration argues that these policies provide safe havens for criminals, while local officials maintain they foster trust with immigrant communities.</p>

This militaristic approach contrasts with recent U.S. policy that emphasized strengthening the rule of law in Mexico.

          <p>As official research positions are lost to budget cuts, the work of citizen scientists to preserve federal forests is becoming more valuable. Volunteers like Don Pike are helping to manage federal lands, which government workers say have been underfunded for years. He and his team of volunteers have cleared 550 of the roughly 14,000 acres they oversee. In February, at least 2,000 employees had been eliminated from the U.S. Forest Service, which is responsible for lands across the country that, together, rival the size of Texas.</p>
