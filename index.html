          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour on personal online activities, such as shopping or property browsing, does not constitute a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage. The ruling highlighted that the employer had no clear policy against personal use, the owner also used the work computer for personal reasons, and the dismissal seemed timed to prevent the employee from reaching two years of service, which grants unfair dismissal protection.</p>

          <p>Officials in Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans are responding to threats from President Trump to deploy the National Guard, despite a recent federal court ruling against such actions for domestic law enforcement in California. While crime rates in these cities are reportedly decreasing, local Democratic leaders in Illinois and Maryland are vehemently opposing the move, preparing for legal challenges. In contrast, Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the potential intervention, highlighting a sharp political divide on the use of military forces for civilian policing and public safety.</p>

          <p>Lululemon's shares dropped by 20% after the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings forecast, attributing a projected $240 million hit to new tariffs. Despite exceeding second-quarter earnings estimates, the athletic apparel retailer missed revenue expectations and reported a 4% decline in same-store sales in the Americas. CEO Calvin McDonald acknowledged that the company's product offerings have become "stale" and "predictable," and outlined plans to refresh its styles and improve design capabilities to regain momentum in the U.S. market.

The dismissal was based on a technicality, with the judge criticizing the complaint as a "shotgun pleading" that improperly combined multiple allegations. Newsmax has been given an opportunity to refile the lawsuit by Thursday, with the network stating it intends to do so after correcting the structural issues in its legal arguments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation increasing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had ended a century-long policy of unlimited deductions. The move is particularly significant for taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and California, though it is projected to increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade.

          <p>The nation's unified approach to vaccination is collapsing as several states and major medical societies issue their own guidelines in opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services, now led by Robert F.

In response, states like California, Oregon, and Washington have formed a coalition to create independent, science-based recommendations, leading to a fragmented public health landscape that experts warn could weaken defenses against infectious diseases for years.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," arguing the original name has a "stronger sound" associated with winning wars. While the change requires congressional approval, the move reflects a symbolic shift in rhetoric. The department was originally named "Defense" in 1947 to unify the armed forces and emphasize war deterrence in the nuclear age. Critics worry the name change implies a more bellicose foreign policy, while some supporters argue it more accurately reflects the department's modern role.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein controversy continues to generate political pressure for the Trump administration, with victims and their families now publicly calling for the full release of government case files. This article outlines three potential scenarios: the pressure could intensify and cause significant political damage if new, damaging information emerges; the story could rumble on as a distraction without causing a major crisis; or public attention could eventually fade, allowing the administration to outlast the scandal. The White House has consistently dismissed the criticisms as a politically motivated "hoax."</p>

          <p>As part of a heightened counter-drug initiative named Operation Pacific Viper, the U.S. Coast Guard has seized over 40,000 pounds of cocaine and apprehended 36 suspected smugglers in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in the last month. The operation involves coordinating with international partners to disrupt illicit narcotics shipments from South America before they reach American shores. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted, underscoring the intensity of its efforts to combat drug cartels in the region.</p>

Verified video footage shows the tower collapsing after being hit by multiple projectiles, sending smoke and debris toward the nearby tents. The Israel Defense Forces claimed the building was being used by Hamas for terrorist infrastructure and had issued evacuation warnings, a claim the building's management and Hamas officials have denied as a pretext for destroying civilian structures.</p>

          <p>A controversial Texas law that limits property ownership and leasing rights for Chinese citizens has officially taken effect, leaving affected residents in a state of legal uncertainty. The law is part of a broader trend across more than two dozen U.S. states considering or passing similar legislation, fueled by growing tensions between the U.S. and China. An appeal filed by plaintiffs has been overturned, meaning there will likely be no legal relief for those impacted until at least November, when oral arguments are scheduled.</p>

          <p>Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is canceling its flight services in 12 U.S. cities, including pulling out of all Northern California airports—Oakland, Sacramento, and San Jose—as well as San Diego. The move comes as the airline, which recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time this year, seeks to cut unprofitable routes amid poor demand for domestic leisure travel. The company has expressed "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operating, and competitors are already moving to add flights to capitalize on the service gaps.</p>

          <p>ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance acknowledged to employees that he "faults himself" for not paying enough attention to costs while focusing on large acquisitions, leading to the company becoming less competitive. This admission came during a town hall meeting following the announcement of plans to cut up to 25% of the workforce as part of a major restructuring. The job cuts, which could begin as early as November, are part of a plan to achieve $2 billion in savings after a series of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, including last year's purchase of Marathon Oil.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic reflects on the shared psychology of political dissidents, drawing parallels between recent pro-democracy protests in Georgia and the historical struggles of Soviet dissenters. Author Lauren Grodstein, after witnessing the Georgian protests, notes a "remarkable ability" among activists to persevere despite the apparent hopelessness of their cause, a trait also observed in those who resisted Soviet repression. This perspective prompts a reflection on the choices faced by citizens in the U.S. today, suggesting that the fight for democracy is a long-term, perhaps lifelong, commitment.</p>

          <p>A report from House Republicans claims that the Pentagon has funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes, some of which are blacklisted by the U.S. for their ties to China's military. The investigation argues that these partnerships have allowed China to exploit American taxpayer-funded research for its own military advancement, eroding U.S. technological dominance. The report calls for better safeguards to prevent hostile foreign exploitation of U.S. research, though some Defense Department officials maintain that research should remain open as long as it is unclassified.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching competition laws by favoring its own products in the online advertising technology sector. The regulator found that Google's "self-preferencing" practices boosted its own ad exchange, AdX, at the expense of rivals, leading to higher costs and reduced revenues for competitors and publishers. This marks the third time the EU has penalized Google for anticompetitive behavior, and the company has been ordered to end the illegal practices or potentially face structural remedies, such as selling parts of its ad tech business.</p>
