        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged, pausing a series of cuts made earlier this year. This decision comes amid significant economic uncertainty, primarily driven by the looming threat of new U.S. tariffs on EU goods, which could be imposed if a trade agreement is not reached. Policymakers are adopting a cautious stance, waiting to assess the geopolitical and economic fallout before making further moves. The ECB noted that while the disinflation process is nearing completion, the trade disputes create an exceptionally uncertain environment for future growth.</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group has disclosed that it is the subject of a Justice Department investigation regarding its Medicare billing practices. The company confirmed it is complying with both criminal and civil requests for information and has initiated its own third-party review of its business policies. This development follows earlier reports of a probe into whether the company inflated diagnoses to receive higher payments from the Medicare Advantage program. The news has negatively impacted the company's stock, adding to a tumultuous period marked by high medical costs and a major cyberattack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation. Top CD rates, particularly from online banks, are significantly higher than national averages, with some short-term accounts offering competitive yields. This article outlines the best available rates across various terms, from six months to five years, and provides strategies for savers to secure the most favorable returns. Experts suggest considering a laddering strategy to take advantage of the current inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and refinance interest rates remain elevated compared to previous years, posing challenges for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This article provides a snapshot of the national average rates for 15-year and 30-year loans, while also offering guidance on how to secure a better rate. Strategies include strengthening one's credit profile, paying bills on time, and shopping around to compare different lenders. While the market is difficult, experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring some relief to borrowers in the near future (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Beijing, the European Union and China have agreed to establish an upgraded "export supply mechanism" for critical raw materials. The agreement is designed to address European concerns about potential supply chain disruptions and Beijing's use of export controls on rare earths. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the mechanism would allow for immediate checks and solutions for any bottlenecks that arise. This development is seen as a vital step toward rebuilding trust in the trade relationship between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has significantly scaled back its 2025 profit forecast and provided a third-quarter outlook that falls short of Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to slump. The carrier attributes the weaker forecast to a downturn in domestic consumer demand, flat corporate travel, and operational challenges from summer storms. While international travel remains a bright spot, the airline's passenger revenue on domestic routes has declined. The revised outlook reflects broader industry struggles with shifting consumer behavior and economic pressures since the beginning of the year.</p>

          <p>The White House has imposed a 17 percent tariff on Mexican tomatoes, a move that is expected to increase grocery prices for American consumers, especially during fall and winter. The U.S. heavily relies on Mexico for a year-round supply of fresh tomatoes, as domestic production, primarily in Florida, is not cost-effective enough to meet demand outside of the main growing season. While the tariffs are intended to protect U.S. growers, agricultural economists predict that the additional costs will likely be passed on to consumers, making common varieties like roma and beefsteak tomatoes more expensive.</p>

          <p>New data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales estimates that one in eight women, or 12.8% of the female population, were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking in the year up to March 2025. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) published the combined prevalence for the first time to help monitor the government's goal of halving violence against women and girls. The same report indicated a 7% rise in overall crime, largely driven by a 31% increase in fraud and a record number of shoplifting offenses.</p>

          <p>A significant military escalation has occurred on the Thailand-Cambodia border, with troops from both nations clashing in multiple areas, resulting in at least 11 deaths, mostly civilians. The conflict, which involved small arms, artillery, and rockets, prompted Thailand to conduct airstrikes on what it described as military targets in Cambodia. In response to the violence, which was reportedly triggered by a mine explosion, Thailand has sealed its land border crossings and urged its nationals to leave Cambodia, while both countries have engaged in diplomatic downgrades.</p>

          <p>Tesla has reported its second consecutive quarter of declining automotive sales, causing its stock to fall by 6% in premarket trading. The electric vehicle maker missed both top and bottom-line expectations, with automotive revenue falling 16% year-over-year. On an earnings call, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that the company could face a few "rough quarters" due to factors like expiring federal EV tax credits and increasing competition from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers. The company did not provide official guidance for the year, signaling continued uncertainty about its growth prospects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift in the nature of summer camp may explain why some children today are less enthusiastic about attending. This article explores how camps have evolved from generalized, full-summer experiences focused on outdoor activities to highly specialized, shorter sessions centered on topics like coding or ceramics. This trend may be driven by the anxieties of millennial parents who prioritize skill development and resume-building over unstructured play. As a result, for some children, camp may feel less like a fun break and more like a high-pressure extension of the school year.</p>

While some documents have been released, naming high-profile figures like former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, conspiracy theories persist about a suppressed "client list."

          <p>A senior national director at NHS England has issued a stark warning that the upcoming five-day strike by resident doctors will cause undeniable harm to patients. The strike, part of a long-running pay dispute with the government, is expected to severely disrupt both emergency services and non-urgent care, such as hip and knee operations. While the British Medical Association (BMA) argues the strike is necessary after talks broke down, NHS managers are concerned about the impact on a system already grappling with long waiting lists and the high cost of hiring senior doctors for cover.</p>
