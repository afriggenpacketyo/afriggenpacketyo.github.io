        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's proposal to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure amid declining letter volumes. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both services will be slightly relaxed. The reform to the Universal Service Obligation is intended to ensure the financial sustainability of the postal service. Ofcom emphasized that these changes are necessary for the service's survival but require effective implementation by Royal Mail to improve performance and reduce long delays.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the United Kingdom, marked by royal pageantry, is being overshadowed by concerns over US President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies. While Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are discussing bilateral issues like defense and migration, the larger geopolitical focus is on a potential US-EU trade deal and how to navigate Trump's tariff threats. The article notes that Trump has already announced new tariffs on numerous countries, leaving the European Union in a state of uncertainty as it rushes to negotiate an agreement with Washington.

          <p>The European Union remains in a state of limbo after a key deadline for establishing a trade agreement with the United States passed without a resolution. US President Donald Trump has indicated a decision on tariffs could come soon, noting that communications have improved, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the EU has made significant offers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the EU is preparing for all scenarios, defending its interests while working in good faith. The ongoing uncertainty highlights the complex negotiations, with the EU expected to accept a 10% baseline tariff while hoping for sectoral exemptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major sanitation project.

A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, facilitated the hour-long rescue operation, which was praised by city officials.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry has stated that the Democratic party mishandled the issue of immigration, allowing the US-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden presidency. In an interview with the BBC, Kerry said he believed this failure provided a political opening for Donald Trump, remarking that "Trump was right" about the need for a protected border. His comments come amid an internal party debate over immigration policy and the current administration's aggressive deportation efforts, which have sparked protests and legal challenges in cities like Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful and long-standing social housing policies, which provide homes for a broad range of income levels. The city's housing stock is 43% social housing, which includes municipally owned units and properties managed by limited-profit associations, keeping rent levels significantly lower than the private market. Originating in the 1920s, the system has remained stable despite privatization pressures seen elsewhere in Europe. While the model is praised for making housing a basic need, challenges remain regarding the complexity of the allocation system and accessibility for newcomers.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain. This allows researchers to command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. The experiment demonstrated that the bee obeyed the commands approximately 90% of the time, marking a significant advancement in micro-robotics and bio-integrated technology.</p>

The announcement caused a spike in US copper prices, creating a significant premium over the global market.

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to address persistent youth unemployment amid a sluggish economy and intense market competition. Authorities will offer a one-time subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) to employers who hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. To qualify, companies must sign formal contracts and make full social insurance contributions for the new hires for at least three months. This initiative is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market, which also includes expanding a "work-for-relief" public works program to generate more jobs.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens, particularly women, following a recent rise in kidnappings and other violent crimes targeting them. Analysts suggest Chinese business owners are being targeted due to a perception that they operate with large amounts of cash outside the formal banking system. The embassy urged Chinese nationals to avoid going out alone and to take extra safety precautions. This warning comes amid a general increase in kidnappings in South Africa and follows a fatal home invasion that targeted Chinese citizens in May.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the state of California, arguing its animal welfare regulations for egg-laying hens are causing a nationwide increase in egg prices. The suit claims that California's rules, which mandate more space for chickens, constitute "unnecessary red tape" and unlawfully regulate farms in other states. This legal action is part of President Trump's public campaign to lower egg prices, a major consumer concern. California officials have previously defended these laws, which were passed by voters, as necessary measures to prevent animal cruelty and reduce foodborne disease risks.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk a second cargo ship in the Red Sea within a week, prompting a search and rescue operation for the crew. The Greek-operated vessel, Eternity C, was hit by rocket-propelled grenades, and while six crew members were rescued, at least three were killed and others remain missing. The Houthis claimed they attacked the ship because it was heading to Israel and stated they took some crew members to a "safe location." The attacks highlight the ongoing threat to international shipping in the region, with the EU and US condemning the acts and calling for the crew's release.</p>

          <p>Shares in WK Kellogg, the North American cereal division of the Kellogg's brand, surged over 50% following reports of an imminent takeover by Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. The deal, valued at approximately $3 billion, would give the owner of Nutella and Ferrero Rocher a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. The potential acquisition comes as traditional cereal makers like WK Kellogg face financial struggles due to shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising costs. Ferrero has been actively expanding its portfolio in recent years by acquiring other major food and confectionery brands. (not investment advice)</p>

This proposal aims to create a clear policy distinction from the Labour government, which recently scaled back its own planned welfare cuts after a backbench rebellion. The Conservative plan also seeks to differentiate from Reform UK by defending the two-child benefit cap, which Nigel Farage's party has pledged to eliminate.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he will impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, citing the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as an "international disgrace." In a letter, Trump called the case a "Witch Hunt" and demanded it end, linking the punitive trade measure directly to the legal proceedings against his political ally. The move has been condemned by Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who stated that the judicial process is an internal matter and that Brazil will not accept any form of tutelage. This represents a significant escalation in Trump's use of tariffs for political leverage.</p>

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam has highlighted severe wealth inequality across Africa, stating that the continent's four wealthiest individuals possess more wealth than the poorest 50% of its population combined. The report notes that Africa's billionaire population has grown significantly since 2000, with their collective wealth increasing by 56% in the last five years alone. Oxfam argues that government policies biased against the poor and ineffective tax systems allow the super-rich to accumulate more wealth at the expense of public services.

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where recent wildfires created a high flood risk, officials and residents were prepared, resulting in a swift response and limited casualties despite significant property damage. Conversely, a few days earlier in Texas, the ferocity of the flooding caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 119 people. The contrast illustrates how recent experience with disasters can significantly influence a community's ability to respond effectively to new threats.</p>

The official reiterated Israel's core war aims of returning hostages and eliminating Hamas, making it clear that no permanent peace is possible unless Hamas is completely disarmed. The main sticking point in negotiations remains the presence of Israeli forces within Gaza during and after any ceasefire. The comments suggest that even if a temporary truce is reached, the conflict is likely to resume.</p>
