          <h2>Supreme Court's Actions Seen as Expanding Presidential Power Under Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 14:56:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that the Supreme Court is increasingly enabling President Trump to consolidate power, citing a recent case involving the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards. The author, Kate Shaw, a law professor, contends that the court's decision effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, granting the president considerable new authority. She suggests this ruling, along with others, risks assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law, potentially emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order. The author expresses concern that the court's actions undermine lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law, ultimately endangering the system of checks and balances.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article discusses the increasing use of ketamine therapy, spurred by its depiction on reality TV and its FDA approval as a nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression. While some studies show its effectiveness in treating severe depression, particularly in veterans, experts caution about the risks of addiction and adverse health issues. The article notes that ketamine, a dissociative drug, can create more connections between brain cells, easing depression and suicidal thoughts. However, at high doses, it can cause cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological problems, including seizures and amnesia. The article stresses the importance of medical supervision during IV treatment and warns against viewing it as a quick fix for mental health issues.</p>

Authorities are working to identify the victims and their nationalities, and an investigation has been opened to determine the circumstances of the accident, including weather conditions and avalanche activity. Separately, in Kandersteg, another skier was killed in an avalanche that buried three people on the Morgenhorn mountain; the deceased was identified as a 29-year-old Swiss citizen.

          <p>Cindy McCain, head of the U.N. World Food Program, stated that the current amount of aid trucks entering Gaza is insufficient to address the critical food insecurity affecting 500,000 people. Speaking on CBS News, McCain criticized Israel's blockade, emphasizing the need for increased aid at scale to avert a potential famine. She disputed claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it instead to the desperation of starving people. McCain urged the international community to apply pressure to ensure adequate food supplies reach Gaza, highlighting that only about 100 trucks are currently allowed in, compared to 600 during the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. The officer, Leslie Oâ€™Neal, initially accused Arias-Cristobal of making an improper turn, but the charges were later dropped. Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico at age four, narrowly missed qualifying for DACA. Her arrest sparked national attention, with some supporting her release and others calling for her deportation. The incident highlights the impact of local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE under 287(g) contracts and a recent Georgia law mandating such agreements.</p>

          <p>Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer for the movie "Rust," has been released from prison after serving 14 months for her involuntary manslaughter conviction in the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Gutierrez was found guilty of reckless handling of firearms and ammunition on the set. Alec Baldwin, who pointed the gun that killed Hutchins, was initially charged but the charges were later dismissed due to evidence concealment by prosecutors. Assistant director David Halls received a suspended sentence for negligent use of a deadly weapon, and several civil lawsuits against Baldwin and the producers remain unresolved.</p>

Parsons, a philosophy professor focusing on military ethics, stated that West Point began censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideological preferences. He argued that these orders aimed to indoctrinate rather than educate, leading him to believe that his research agenda was effectively banned.

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to a DW report. While promoting the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) to foster cooperation on net-zero emissions, Japan continues to invest heavily in LNG as a "transitional fuel" for partner countries. Critics argue this constitutes greenwashing, as LNG involves significant emissions and locks Indonesia and other nations into long-term fossil fuel dependency. The report suggests Japan's energy policies prioritize securing access to LNG and reselling surplus, potentially hindering the transition to renewable energy in Southeast Asia.</p>

Unlike authoritative, authoritarian, or gentle parenting, this framework emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view misbehavior as a stress signal, and take responsibility after conflicts. The article outlines practical steps for parents to practice emotionally safe parenting, including doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, Americans are reflecting on his legacy with gatherings in Houston and Minneapolis, according to a BBC News report. Floyd's murder sparked global protests against racism and police brutality, but the national reckoning that followed appears to be fading as President Trump rolls back police reforms. Events in Minneapolis include a church service, candlelight vigil, and a festival at George Floyd Square. The article notes that Floyd's death forced a long-overdue reckoning with systemic racism, though much work remains to be done.</p>
