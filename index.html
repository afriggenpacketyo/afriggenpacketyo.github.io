          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in a septic tank in Nanyuki, Kenya, a local court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national, allegedly a British soldier. The case, which involves allegations of a cover-up within the British Army, has regained momentum following new reports and an internal investigation into soldiers' conduct. Wanjiru's friends and family, supported by UK Defence Secretary John Healey's recent condolences, continue to seek justice, hoping for an extradition that would mark a precedent in holding British soldiers accountable for civilian deaths abroad.</p>

          <p>British athlete Georgia Hunter Bell is set to compete in the 800m final at the World Championships in Tokyo, creating a compelling showdown with her training partner, Keely Hodgkinson. After a five-year hiatus from the sport and a successful comeback that earned her an Olympic 1500m bronze, Hunter Bell has decided to focus on the 800m. She views the potential for a one-two finish for Great Britain as an exciting opportunity rather than a rivalry, highlighting the supportive team environment created by their coaches. This marks her first year as a full-time athlete.</p>

          <p>A significant cyberattack on Collins Aerospace's 'Muse' software has caused a second day of major disruptions at several European airports, including London's Heathrow. The system, which manages check-in and baggage for multiple airlines, failed on Saturday, forcing staff to resort to manual processes like pen and paper, leading to long queues and hundreds of delays. While the company RTX is working to resolve the issue, airports like Brussels have canceled half their departing flights, and authorities are urging passengers to check their flight status before traveling.</p>

The decision follows a deadline Starmer set in July for Israel to agree to a ceasefire and commit to a two-state solution, conditions which have not been met. The move has drawn sharp criticism from the Israeli government and some UK Conservatives, who argue it rewards terrorism, but UK ministers cite a moral responsibility to act amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements.</p>

This shift is a strategic response to the prevalence of effective, high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back more risky. By utilizing goalkeepers with strong distribution skills like David Raya and targeting tall forwards, the teams can bypass the press, gain territory, and create unpredictable attacks.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is continuing to strengthen over open waters and is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday. The storm is currently tracking northwest and its center is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are in effect for the island. While it is not projected to make landfall, the National Hurricane Center warns that distant swells from Gabrielle could reach the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward, as well as Atlantic Canada, early next week.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Discover Evidence of Recent Landslides on the Moon Triggered by Moonquakes</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has found evidence of recent landslides on the moon, suggesting that the celestial body is more geologically active than previously thought. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, which they believe were triggered by moonquakes. This discovery challenges the conventional wisdom that the moon's internal activity has largely ceased. The findings have significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases, as they highlight potential geological hazards that must be considered for infrastructure safety.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Signs Legislation Banning On-Duty Federal Officers from Wearing Masks</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at increasing protections for residents against federal immigration enforcement, including one law that prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. The "No Secret Police Act" also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number. Other new laws restrict immigration agents' access to schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant. Newsom framed the legislation as a necessary pushback against what he called a "terror campaign" of "secret police" operating under the Trump administration's directives.</p>
