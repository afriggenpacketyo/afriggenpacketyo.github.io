          <p>The relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated due to disagreements over policy, escalating into a public feud. Musk has criticized Trump's proposed domestic policy bill, leading to a heated exchange on social media where Trump threatened to cut subsidies for Musk's companies. Musk responded defiantly, and the rift has caused significant market turmoil for Tesla, with shares plummeting and wiping out billions in value. The feud raises questions about the future of government support for Tesla and the potential for regulatory challenges, as the once-close alliance between the two figures has now collapsed. Optimism surrounding Tesla's prospects has waned as the fallout continues to unfold.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the United States to face federal charges related to alien smuggling. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport undocumented people, including women and children, over the past decade. Maryland leaders, including Senator Chris Van Hollen, have emphasized the importance of due process in this case, with Van Hollen stating that the case is about constitutional rights. Abrego Garcia's attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties, and the case has drawn attention to the Trump administration's immigration policies and handling of deportation cases.</p>

          <p>Chicago Police Officer Krystal Rivera was unintentionally shot and killed by a fellow officer while pursuing a suspect in the Chatham neighborhood. Officers were attempting to conduct an investigatory stop when the suspect fled into an apartment building, leading to a confrontation where a second person pointed a rifle at them. During the incident, an officer discharged a weapon, fatally striking Rivera in the back, and the vehicle transporting Rivera to the hospital caught fire due to a mechanical issue. Superintendent Larry Snelling honored Rivera's dedication to saving lives by participating in a march to raise awareness of missing women, and a psychologist expressed concern for the mental well-being of fellow officers in Rivera's district.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year as police target employers exploiting undocumented migrants. Immigration officers arrested more than 6,400 people during raids at businesses, including restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites. These businesses often subject migrants to poor conditions, illegal working hours, and below-minimum wages, and the government has returned nearly 30,000 people who did not have the right to be in the UK. The government is cracking down on illegal migration by tightening work visas and addressing overstaying, aiming to root out unscrupulous employers and disrupt illegal workers.</p>

The lawsuit claims that the county began using drones to track illegal cannabis cultivation but has expanded their use to find other code violations. Residents report ongoing privacy concerns and a loss of enjoyment of their property due to the drones hovering overhead.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling more than a dozen flights a day due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs, with Brazilian imports facing a 10% tariff. The airline said it is cutting routes served by multiple flights to minimize disruption to communities, and the delayed aircraft were expected to serve the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, California, Colorado, Utah, and western Canada. Delta Air Lines has also taken steps to avoid paying tariffs on new aircraft by having them delivered internationally before bringing them to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly mused about creating a new political party in America, potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new party representing the "80% in the middle," and endorsed a fan's suggestion to name it the "America Party." The idea comes after a public falling out between Musk and Trump, with Musk criticizing Trump's policies and Trump threatening to cut subsidies to Musk's companies. While it's unclear how serious Musk is, the move could signal his intent to challenge Trump's influence.</p>

El Salvador agreed to release Ábrego García after the US presented an arrest warrant, with the Attorney General stating that he played a "significant role" in an alien smuggling ring.

          <p>Tesla has been facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter, and these headwinds strengthened considerably this week. CEO Elon Musk officially concluded his term with the Trump administration at the end of May, hitting the 130-day mark, the maximum time allowed for a "special government employee." After Musk called the "one, big beautiful bill" an "abomination" and rallied his followers on X to "kill the bill," Trump said Musk had gone "CRAZY" and threatened to end government contracts and cut off subsidies for Musk's companies. The rift sent Tesla shares plummeting 14% on Thursday, wiping out roughly $152 billion in value, the most for any day in the company's 15 year-history on the public market.</p>

          <p>The government is struggling to cut the amount of foreign aid it spends on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, the BBC has learnt. New figures released quietly by ministers in recent days show the Home Office plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year - that is only marginally less than the £2.3bn it spent in 2024/25. Foreign aid is supposed to be spent alleviating poverty by providing humanitarian and development assistance overseas, but under international rules, governments can spend some of their foreign aid budgets at home to support asylum seekers during the first year after their arrival.</p>
