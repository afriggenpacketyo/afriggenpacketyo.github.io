            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish the Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission, signaling a potential effort to acquire parts of Illinois. This move comes as some Illinois counties seek to separate from the Chicago area, motivated by political divisions. While Indiana's government supports the idea, approval from the Illinois government and the U.S. Congress is needed, though Illinois officials have expressed opposition. The effort is fueled by political differences between the Democrat-controlled Chicago area and Republican-represented regions of Illinois. Optimism score: 50</p>
