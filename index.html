          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in its upcoming Spending Review, affecting areas from the NHS to schools. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to health will largely determine potential cuts to other unprotected areas. The government has committed to scrutinizing every pound spent, amidst speculation that spending cuts will be made due to the Chancellor's stance on borrowing and taxes. The IFS highlights that spending was front-loaded earlier in the parliament term, implying a slowdown in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including freezing federal contracts and grants and threatening its tax-exempt status, have ignited a debate over academic freedom. The administration claims its actions are aimed at addressing antisemitism, discrimination, and foreign influence on campus. Harvard has publicly rejected the demands, stating they amount to ceding control of the university to the government and are an unconstitutional attack on academic freedom. Some observers believe Trump's motives are to intimidate and break down institutions of higher learning, while others detect an element of class warfare.</p>

          <p>Doctors' associations and student advocates are warning that a proposal in the Republican-led budget bill could worsen a national shortage of doctors. The bill would limit federal student loans for professional programs like medical school to $150,000 and eliminate a federal graduate loan program. Advocates warn these changes could deter low-income students from pursuing medicine, make loans harder to repay, or push students into expensive private lending. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates the US will face a shortage of between 37,800 and 124,000 physicians by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An interview with Sam Tanenhaus explores the life and influence of William F. Buckley Jr., the architect of the modern conservative movement. Buckley's significance endures through his role in shaping the Republican Party, his prolific writing, and his pioneering use of media. His early work challenged Ivy League institutions, and his television program invented the talking-head cable-news format. Buckley's complex relationship with Ronald Reagan and his views on populism are also discussed.</p>
