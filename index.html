          <p>Retail sales experienced a significant drop of 0.9% in May, surpassing the anticipated 0.6% decrease, according to the Commerce Department, indicating a pullback in consumer spending. This decline, adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, follows a 0.1% loss in April, reflecting growing concerns over tariffs and geopolitical uncertainties. Notable decreases were observed in building materials, garden stores, gasoline stations, and motor vehicle retailers, while online sales and furniture stores saw gains. Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that families are becoming more selective with their spending due to wariness of higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investing experts suggest gold prices could soon reach $4,000 per ounce, driven by factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank buying. Ben Nadelstein from Monetary Metals believes gold could hit this milestone in 2025 if it follows last year's percentage gains, while Brandon Aversano of The Alloy Market expects it within a year due to instability and conflict. Thomas Winmill at Midas Funds takes a more measured approach, suggesting it could take one to two years without major geopolitical events. The experts recommend maintaining a long-term outlook, considering leasing out gold, and investing in gold mining mutual funds as strategies for investing in the gold market.

          <p>A brain-dead woman's baby was delivered via caesarean section in Georgia after a hospital initially kept her on life support due to state abortion laws. The woman's mother, April Newkirk, stated that her daughter, a 31-year-old nurse, would be taken off life support on Tuesday. The baby boy, weighing 1lb 13oz, is in the neonatal intensive care unit and is expected to be okay. The hospital previously cited Georgia's abortion ban, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, as a factor in their decision to maintain life support.

Joe Jacobson, founder of the fund, believes the ad will resonate with young men who may be dating or seeking relationships, as it highlights the fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents racially profiling and detaining citizens.

Shorter-term CDs currently offer higher rates, while longer-term CDs provide protection against future rate decreases; consider a CD ladder for a mix of both.

The decrease was influenced by a significant drop in auto sales, as Americans had increased car purchases in March to circumvent the 25% duty on imported cars and parts. Despite low unemployment and cooling inflation, consumer confidence has weakened this year, affecting overall spending.
