Garcia claims agents boasted about arresting 31 'bodies' and high-fived each other while he was detained. He was held for over an hour at Dodger Stadium and later released without charges. Garcia, a photographer and doctoral student, was shaken by the experience, feeling the agents dehumanized those they apprehended by reducing them to mere 'bodies.'</p>

The defense argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice, preventing it from being refiled.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. The ruling prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. President Trump hinted at a possible deal with Harvard, stating that negotiations are progressing and could lead to a 'historic' settlement. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The bill, now headed to the governor's desk, would make Rhode Island the eleventh state with some form of prohibition on these firearms. The proposal only applies to sales and manufacturing, not possession, similar to a law in Washington state. Critics argue that the ban does little to curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, while some gun control advocates say the bill is too weak.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has been released on bail after being detained for more than three months. A federal judge ruled that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to his community. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. The government has argued his activism impedes U.S. foreign policy and has moved to have him deported.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested he may try to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for keeping interest rates steady. Trump has been critical of Powell for months, urging faster interest rate cuts. It remains unclear if the president has the legal authority to fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026. The president's attacks stem from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies, which he believes are hindering economic growth.</p>

          <p>Two recent videos on Chinese social media have reignited the debate about the erosion of moral values, specifically regarding giving up seats to the elderly. In one video, an elderly woman was criticized for asking a young woman to vacate a courtesy seat on a subway. In another, an elderly man was refused a seat on a crowded train, leading to a verbal confrontation. These incidents highlight the tension between traditional values of respect for the elderly and the pressures of modern, individualistic society.</p>

          <p>The United States' failure to reach a tariff deal with Japan and threats to impose new duties on imports may strengthen China's negotiating position. The US looks weak in the short term, which should prompt China to take a harder line with Washington on reaching a deal, analysts said. US President Donald Trump raised duties on Chinese imports to more than 100 per cent in April. Beijingâ€™s negotiators would draw strength from the US threat to notify trading partners of new duties and the lack of a US-Japan deal because both showed it was hard for Washington to get what it wanted through talks this summer.

          <p>An Iranian missile strike in northern Israel wounded 23 people, as the two countries continued exchanging strikes amid diplomatic efforts. The attack, which involved approximately 20 missiles fired by Iran, occurred as European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met in Geneva. Ahead of the meeting, Araghchi stated that Iran is open to 'dialogue' but has 'nothing to discuss' with the U.S. as long as Israel continues its strikes. A diplomatic effort to negotiate a settlement to the conflict began in Geneva between European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.</p>
