        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration recently imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, leading to a 3% jump in oil prices. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these measures aim to pressure Moscow for a ceasefire in Ukraine, citing its lack of commitment to peace. This action represents a significant policy shift, as the administration had previously relied on trade measures rather than direct sanctions on Russia's oil industry. The move also follows President Trump's efforts to persuade India to reduce its purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>From next year, NHS health checks in England will officially include questions about menopause and its symptoms for women aged 40 to 74. This initiative aims to identify individuals who could benefit from advice and support, including hormone replacement therapy or counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes the move will reduce suffering and stigma, bringing menopause into mainstream health discussions. While campaigners welcome the measure, concerns remain about the low uptake of health checks in some communities and the need for staff training.</p>

Their support, such as childcare or financial aid, helps buffer the negative effects of trauma, though it doesn't erase them entirely. This finding aligns with the "grandmother hypothesis," an evolutionary theory suggesting grandmothers increase their daughters' fertility by helping with child-rearing.

          <h2>New Jersey Sues Amazon Over Alleged Discrimination Against Pregnant and Disabled Workers</h2>

          <p>New Jersey's Attorney General has sued Amazon, alleging the company violated state anti-discrimination laws by discriminating against thousands of pregnant employees and those with disabilities in its warehouses. The lawsuit claims Amazon placed workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and retaliated against them, sometimes leading to termination for failing to meet productivity targets despite accommodations. Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests. This action follows a years-long investigation and previous scrutiny of Amazon's treatment of its front-line workforce regarding pregnancy accommodations.</p>

          <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is re-evaluating its previous ruling that expanded President Trump's power to deploy federalized troops to cities. A rare conclave of three judges is reviewing the legal framework of an obscure U.S. code, which has been central to Trump's military interventions. The debate centers on defining "rebellion" and the level of deference owed to the president's judgment. California's Solicitor General argues the government's broad interpretation includes "any form of resistance," raising concerns about federal overreach and potential challenges to state sovereignty. The outcome could significantly impact future domestic troop deployments.</p>

          <p>As the government shutdown nears its fourth week, several states, including Pennsylvania and Texas, have warned that November SNAP benefits will not be paid without a prompt resolution. This impacts 42 million low-income Americans who rely on the program for groceries. The acting SNAP director indicated that benefit checks might be smaller or delayed next month. While the White House announced tariff revenue would fund WIC during the shutdown, no similar commitment has been made for SNAP. President Trump's spending plan also includes future reductions and stricter work requirements for the program.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on Balkans-based criminal gangs and financiers accused of facilitating illegal migrant crossings across the English Channel. This action comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosts a Western Balkans summit to address migration, facing pressure to curb the rising number of Channel crossings, which may surpass 2022's record. Starmer emphasized the government's determination to "smash the gangs" involved in these dangerous journeys.

          <p>The UK's September inflation rate remained static at 3.8%, below the expected 4%, providing Chancellor Rachel Reeves with potential economic flexibility. Economists anticipate further declines in inflation next spring. While still high compared to other G7 nations, the International Monetary Fund projects a return to the 2% target by late next year. Crucially, retail experts believe food price inflation has peaked, reducing the risk of self-fulfilling wage-price spirals. This outlook may enable earlier interest rate cuts and save billions in budget calculations, suggesting a potential break from negative economic cycles. (not investment advice)</p>

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced Democrats plan to "sue immediately," alleging the map was "rigged" and designed to dilute Black voters' power.
