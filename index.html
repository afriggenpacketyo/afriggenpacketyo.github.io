          <p>This article discusses borrowing options for homeowners with 100% home equity, highlighting home equity loans and HELOCs as attractive alternatives to personal loans and credit cards due to tax-deductible interest. While 100% equity doesn't allow borrowing the home's full value, it positions homeowners for better rates and terms. The choice between a HELOC and a home equity loan depends on individual preferences and the interest rate environment, with HELOCs currently offering lower rates and potential future affordability if interest rates decline.

          <p>Novo Nordisk abruptly announced that CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen is stepping down as the company faces increasing competition from Eli Lilly in the weight loss drug market. Eli Lilly's Zepbound is gaining ground on Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, prompting the leadership change. The new CEO will need to address challenges such as launching new weight loss drugs, managing patent expirations, and navigating Medicare drug price negotiations and Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The Novo Nordisk Foundation, the controlling shareholder, had urged the company to consider an "accelerated CEO succession".</p>

While the tax cut is expected to benefit tipped workers, some analysts argue that it may not provide additional relief for those who already have zero taxable income due to the standard deduction. Concerns have also been raised about the potential for the policy to create wage pressure in the service industry and whether it would reduce the incentive for employers to raise wages.

The downgrade, from Aaa to Aa1, was attributed to the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. Investors initially reacted negatively, but then shook off the downgrade and began buying bonds, driving yields lower. In April, similar increases in Treasury yields led to concerns about financial panic and rising rates for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Delaware animal shelter is struggling to care for thousands of chicks that survived being abandoned in a USPS truck for three days. Approximately 12,000 chicks were left without food or water, leading to many fatalities before they were discovered. The USPS is investigating the incident, and the hatchery that raised the chicks is unable to take them back due to biosecurity concerns. The animal shelter is offering the birds for adoption, but is facing financial strain due to the increased demand for space and feed.</p>

          <p>The Indian government is intensifying its crackdown on critics of its recent military campaign against Pakistan, including arresting a political science professor for criticizing those ‚Äúwho are baying for war.‚Äù The government has routinely punished critics with criminal charges and travel bans during Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs tenure. The academic who was arrested, Ali Khan Mahmudabad, is charged with threatening India‚Äôs sovereignty for his social media posts. The social media platform X complained that the Indian government had asked it to block more than 8,000 accounts based in India.</p>
