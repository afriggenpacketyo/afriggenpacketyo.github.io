          <h2>Political Violence Expert Warns of an Era of 'Violent Populism' in America</h2>

          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape, an expert on political violence, warned that the U.S. is in a "watershed moment" for an era of "violent populism." Pape's research indicates a rising tide of politically motivated attacks from both the right and the left, alongside growing public support for the use of force to achieve political goals. He identified the nation's demographic shift from a white-majority to a white-minority democracy as the "taproot" of this trend, with the internet acting as an accelerant rather than the root cause. Pape urged political leaders to condemn violence jointly to restrain their constituents.</p>

          <p>The small town of Stanley, Idaho, narrowly avoided destruction during an "unprecedented" 2024 wildfire season, a story that underscores the increasing threat of climate-driven fires across the American West. Heroic firefighting efforts and favorable weather shifts were crucial in saving the tourist town and the nearby Redfish Lake Lodge from two separate massive blazes. The incident serves as a case study in the vulnerability of communities in fire-prone areas, especially as hotter and drier conditions deplete firefighting resources. Residents and officials reflect on the near-miss as a warning that future disasters may not be so narrowly averted.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has accused the United States of illegally seizing a Venezuelan fishing boat within its exclusive economic zone. According to a statement from Caracas, the USS Jason Dunham, a U.S. destroyer, deployed armed agents who boarded and occupied the vessel with nine fishermen for eight hours. Venezuela condemned the incident as a "direct provocation" and an act of "excessive military means" aimed at escalating tensions in the region. The event occurs amid heightened pressure from Washington on the Maduro government, including the deployment of U.S. warships for anti-drug operations.</p>

          <p>New York Giants offensive lineman James Hudson III drew scrutiny during a divisional game against the Dallas Cowboys after committing four penalties on the team's opening drive, costing them 30 yards. One of the infractions was for unnecessary roughness, where Hudson took an open-handed swing at Cowboys pass-rusher James Houston's helmet. The series of penalties ultimately stalled the drive, forcing the Giants to settle for a field goal instead of a potential touchdown. Hudson, a former Cleveland Browns draft pick, was playing due to an injury to the team's starting lineman, Andrew Thomas.</p>

          <p>Ricky "The Hitman" Hatton, a former two-division world boxing champion from Manchester, has died at the age of 46. Known for his aggressive, fan-friendly style and immense popularity, his career highlight was the 2005 victory over Kostya Tszyu for the light-welterweight title in his home city. His massive following, including an estimated 30,000 fans who traveled to Las Vegas for his bout against Floyd Mayweather Jr., cemented his status as a British sporting icon. After retiring, Hatton was candid about his struggles with mental health and addiction, later becoming a successful trainer.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, House Speaker Mike Johnson described the event as a potential "turning point" for the United States, urging political leaders to de-escalate their rhetoric. Johnson stated that treating policy disagreements as existential threats and using inflammatory labels like "Nazi" or "fascist" can incite deranged individuals to violence. He emphasized that Kirk, while a vigorous debater, was motivated by love and never hated his opponents, offering this as a model for future political discourse. The Speaker also assured members of Congress that their security would be a priority.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España, a major professional cycling race, was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road on key parts of the route, making it impossible for the race to proceed safely despite a deployment of over 1,000 police officers. As a result of the cancellation, Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading the general classification going into the final day, was officially declared the overall winner of the tour. The protests disrupted one of cycling's three grand tours.</p>

          <p>A coalition of seven prominent women's organizations has urged the UK government not to weaken its flagship Employment Rights Bill, calling it a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity to reduce the gender pay gap. In a letter to the business secretary, the groups expressed concern over amendments proposed in the House of Lords that could dilute protections for workers, such as those on zero-hours contracts. The bill aims to end exploitative contracts and enhance rights like flexible working and statutory sick pay, measures that the organizations argue would disproportionately benefit women in insecure, low-paid work.</p>

          <p>This article projects that artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia could see its market capitalization reach $10 trillion within the next five years, building on its recent milestone as the first company to surpass a $4 trillion valuation. The prediction is based on the escalating demand for AI infrastructure, which is forecast to become a multi-trillion dollar industry by the end of the decade. For Nvidia to reach this valuation while maintaining its current price-to-sales ratio, it would need to achieve a compound annual revenue growth rate of around 14%, a target considered achievable given its market leadership and past performance.

          <h2>The Rise of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services Challenges Traditional Credit Cards</h2>

          <p>The popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is growing rapidly, with an estimated 91.5 million Americans expected to use them by 2025. These services allow consumers to split purchases into short-term, often interest-free installments, presenting a significant challenge to the traditional credit card industry. For banks and credit card companies, every transaction financed through BNPL represents lost revenue from interchange fees and interest. Furthermore, since BNPL loans are often not reported to credit bureaus, they create a "black hole" in consumer credit profiles, making it harder for lenders to assess risk.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to manage the diplomatic repercussions of an Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, that targeted Hamas leaders. The attack has angered key Arab allies, particularly Qatar, which has been a crucial mediator in negotiations. While Rubio's visit aims to convey President Trump's displeasure, it also seeks to reaffirm strong U.S. support for Israel amid international criticism over the war in Gaza and settlement expansion. Netanyahu emphasized the strength of the U.S.-Israel alliance during a tour of the Western Wall with Rubio.</p>

          <p>The financial markets are closely watching the Federal Reserve this week, with a policy meeting expected to conclude with an interest rate cut on Wednesday. While a 25-basis-point reduction is widely anticipated, investors are more focused on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference for signals about future monetary policy. Recent economic data has been mixed, with high jobless claims and varied inflation readings, but markets still expect further rate cuts this year. This week also features investor day events for cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and industrial conglomerate DuPont, which is preparing to spin off its electronics business. (not investment advice)</p>
