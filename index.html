          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following controversial remarks from its host. Kimmel linked the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk to former President Trump's MAGA movement, prompting significant backlash. The decision came after FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr suggested ABC's broadcast license could be at risk and major affiliate owner Nexstar announced it would preempt the show. While the show is suspended and not cancelled, the move has ignited a fierce debate about free speech, corporate responsibility, and political pressure on media outlets.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in the technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. Other markets across the Asia-Pacific region had a mixed reaction, with South Korea's Kospi rising while Australian and Hong Kong indexes slipped. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of two more potential cuts this year.

          <p>A man has been arrested after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what authorities initially described as a "targeted attack." The suspect, identified as Donald Henson, reportedly exited the vehicle, threw an American flag over the gate, and then fled on foot before being apprehended. Officials noted that Henson, believed to be a former military member with a history of mental health issues, had recently visited the office to make a complaint that lacked a federal nexus. No injuries were reported in the incident.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis has informed employees that the carrier will significantly reduce its flight schedule in November and that more job cuts are likely. The struggling airline, which recently declared its second bankruptcy in under a year, plans to cut capacity by 25% to optimize its network and reduce costs. The company is currently in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors as it evaluates its fleet size to find a path to stability. This move follows a failed acquisition by JetBlue and comes amid high costs and weaker-than-expected domestic travel demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will likely adopt a cautious approach with only moderate easing measures this year. This strategy is expected to help support the yuan by narrowing the interest rate gap between the two countries, thereby reducing capital outflow pressures. The PBOC's daily fixing rate for the yuan was adjusted after the Fed's announcement, reflecting the interconnectedness of global monetary policies. This measured response indicates China's focus on maintaining currency stability amid shifting international economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>D’Anton Lynn, the defensive coordinator for USC, has stated that he has not been contacted by UCLA regarding their vacant head coaching position.

Despite acknowledging his ambition to be a head coach someday, Lynn emphasized that his current focus is entirely on improving the USC defense for their upcoming game.

The uncrewed ship is carrying over 11,000 pounds of vital supplies, research materials, and equipment for the station's crew. Astronauts Jonny Kim and Zena Cardman will use the station's robotic arm to capture the Cygnus and guide it in for berthing.</p>

          <p>Following the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk, former President Donald Trump announced his intention to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The announcement, made via social media, comes after Trump celebrated ABC's decision to suspend Kimmel's show. Designating a decentralized domestic movement like antifa as a terrorist organization presents legal and constitutional challenges, as there is no domestic equivalent to the foreign terror organization list. The move is seen as a significant escalation in Trump's rhetoric against left-leaning activist groups.</p>

This comes as the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, is moving to revoke that finding, citing economic costs.

          <h2>Research Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Researchers measured the alcohol content in figs and plum-like fruits favored by the primates, finding it to be around 0.3% by weight. While not enough to cause intoxication, the steady, low-dose exposure supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors who sought out ripe, calorie-rich food sources.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has recommended that the government should not scrap the individual care plans, known as EHCPs, for children with special educational needs. In a new report, the Education Select Committee called for maintaining these legally binding plans as a "backstop of accountability" for parents. The committee also urged the establishment of new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and increased training for teachers. The recommendations come as the government prepares to announce reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California, along with Louisiana, has the highest poverty rate in the nation at 17.7%. This figure, representing about 7 million residents, shows little improvement from the previous year and marks a significant increase since the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs in 2021. The report highlights that child poverty has more than doubled since 2021 and that people of color and renters are disproportionately affected. The authors argue that poverty is a policy choice, pointing to the success of now-expired federal programs.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom's office called the claim a "straight up lie," pointing out that new duplex and lot-split applications are currently banned in the area's fire burn zone by an emergency order from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. The state has provided funding for affordable housing projects near burn scars, but local governments were given authority to limit development, which Los Angeles has done.</p>
