          <p>Despite polling showing general disapproval of President Trump's handling of the economy, tariffs, and stock market volatility, a majority of his 2024 voters remain confident in his economic leadership. These voters express mixed feelings about tariffs, acknowledging potential short-term challenges but hoping for long-term job creation and economic strengthening for America. While some are cautious about spending and acknowledge potential recession risks, they largely stand by their vote, citing Trump's business experience and a belief that he will improve the economy. The voters also expressed mixed feelings about Trump's views on LGBTQ issues and abortion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has seen an unprecedented use of executive orders and national emergencies, leading to concerns about overreach and potential constitutional crisis. Experts note that Trump's actions, driven by a legal theory granting the president nearly unquestioned control, surpass previous administrations' expansions of executive power. While Trump defends his actions as implementing the agenda Americans voted for, critics argue that he is undermining checks and balances, targeting political opponents, and showing authoritarian tendencies. The courts are pushing back, but the Republican-controlled Congress has been largely unwilling to challenge the president, raising fears about the future of democracy.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, Liz Peek contends that President Trump's voters largely support his first 100 days in office, despite negative coverage from the liberal media. She cites alternative polls suggesting higher approval ratings and highlights the willingness of Trump voters to endure potential economic challenges, such as tariff-related price increases, in support of his agenda to make America competitive again. The article acknowledges potential missteps in the tariff program's rollout but expresses optimism that upcoming trade deals will calm markets and cheer voters. The article is meant to counter what the author believes to be biased polls and reporting.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that more Americans give President Trump a failing grade for his first 100 days in office than any other grade, reflecting declining approval ratings driven by concerns over the economy and tariffs. The poll shows a majority disapproves of Trump's handling of various aspects of the job, including the economy, tariffs, and immigration. There is also a lack of confidence in the economy, with most believing grocery prices will increase and that Trump's policies have negatively impacted them. The poll also indicates that Americans want Trump to obey court orders and that Elon Musk's popularity has declined.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case to determine the extent to which law enforcement can be held accountable for damages caused during "wrong-house raids." The case stems from an incident in Atlanta where FBI agents mistakenly raided the home of Trina Martin and her family, causing significant emotional distress. The court will decide whether the Federal Tort Claims Act allows victims to sue in such cases, even if the officers were acting outside of their specific orders. The outcome could have implications for the balance between government immunity and individual rights in cases of law enforcement misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by a widespread campaign of retribution against political opponents, news organizations, former officials, and universities.

While some allies defend these actions as ending the "weaponization" of law enforcement, critics and targets express concerns about abuse of power and chilling effects on free speech.

The cost-cutting plan will involve reductions in investments and potential redundancies across Volvo's global operations.

          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, aiming to further reduce sugar consumption and tackle obesity. The move would remove the current exemption for milk-based and non-dairy substitute drinks, potentially impacting a significant portion of the market. The government argues that the health benefits of these drinks do not justify the harms from excess sugar, and that the tax would incentivize manufacturers to reduce sugar content. A consultation period will run until July to gather feedback on the proposals.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen a revolutionary shift in US foreign policy, marked by frayed alliances, alienated allies, and disruptive trade policies. The US is now viewed as an "unpredictable ally," with key institutions in crisis and traditional diplomats sidelined. The administration's actions have had significant consequences, including a cutoff in aid to Ukraine and a disruption of global trade. These shifts have prompted some allies to consider limiting intelligence-sharing and pursuing independent defense strategies.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been marked by a rapid shift towards authoritarianism, with the president using executive power to target Congress, the law, the media, and public health. While historically, strongmen have offered stability in exchange for liberties, Trump's actions have been characterized by chaos and economic instability. His trade war has disrupted the economy, and his foreign policy has alienated allies. Despite promises of success, approval ratings have plummeted, and concerns about a recession are growing.</p>

          <p>The first 100 days of Donald Trump's second term have been marked by extreme policies and actions, reshaping the federal government and the US's role in the world. These actions include shattering alliances, attacking the rule of law, trade wars, government "efficiency" measures, and an information war. Opposition and protests have emerged, with lawsuits challenging the administration's agenda. While Trump's actions have made a statement, there are consequences to the executive orders, policy making and budget cuts that could continue to spiral out of the president’s control.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley predict that the US and China will negotiate and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, though they are unlikely to revert to pre-January 2025 levels. While comprehensive talks could lead to further tariff reductions by year's end, the damage already inflicted on the economic cycle is expected to persist. Washington has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports, and Beijing has responded with its own levies on US goods. Given the damage already done to the economic cycle, Morgan Stanley said that the overall direction of growth was expected to remain downward. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2018, the Eagles' White House visit was canceled after most players decided to stay away, with speculation that it was due to ongoing debate surrounding kneeling protests.</p>
