          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 10:43:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can terminate the protected status of around 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal is considered. This action reverses a lower court's decision, allowing the Department of Homeland Security to proceed with revoking protections from deportation and work authorization. Justice Jackson dissented, arguing the decision undervalues the devastating consequences for those affected, as the program had been in place to offer temporary humanitarian parole for individuals from countries facing threats to their safety. The program, similar to those created for Ukrainian and Afghan refugees, now faces immediate termination, potentially impacting a large number of individuals and families. The legal battle continues in the lower courts, but the Supreme Court's decision allows the administration to move forward with its plans in the interim.</p>

          <p>A new report by Enders Analysis accuses major tech firms like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of enabling the "industrial scale theft" of premium video services, particularly live sports. The report claims that a lack of action from these companies is costing broadcasters significant revenue and exposing users to increased cyber-crime risks. The Amazon Fire Stick is specifically identified as a key enabler of piracy, allowing access to illegal streams alongside legitimate services. The report highlights the risk for users who often provide sensitive information like credit card details when accessing illegal streams, making them vulnerable to malware and phishing scams.</p>

          <p>The House Republicans' "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" proposes changes to federal student loan repayment plans that could extend terms up to 30 years. This bill would consolidate the current repayment options to two: a fixed payment plan over 10 to 25 years, and an income-driven repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" with forgiveness after 30 years. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz warns that a 30-year repayment term could be akin to "indentured servitude." The bill has passed the House and is expected to see little changes in the Senate before being signed into law. (not investment advice)</p>

Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will return to the private sector but continue as an adviser to the president. During his time in DOGE, Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, but fell short of this goal, achieving roughly $160 billion in savings, according to his estimates. However, Musk has recently disagreed with Trump over the president's domestic policy package, which Musk believes increases the budget deficit.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being trapped face-down in an icy creek by a 700lb boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers, with a sled dog tourism company providing helicopter transport for the rescue team. It took seven men and inflatable air bags to lift the boulder off him as he drifted in and out of consciousness. The man acknowledged his luck and credited his wife's quick thinking and the efforts of the rescuers for his survival.</p>

They express concern that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to the development of promising new therapies. The expert emphasizes that autism is a complex disorder with multiple variables, and genetics play a significant role in its development.</p>

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump's expansive tariffs is being hailed as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers and the rule of law. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The decision upholds the principle that the president cannot impose taxes in the form of tariffs without legislative authorization. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs, though the administration has appealed the decision.</p>
