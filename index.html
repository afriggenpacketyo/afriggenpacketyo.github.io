          <p>To promote Michael Jackson's album HIStory, ten giant statues were erected around the world in 1995. After Jackson's death, the statues' locations became points of interest for fans. One statue stood at a McDonald's in the Netherlands for years before being removed due to controversy following the Leaving Neverland documentary. Another statue resides in the courtyard of a defunct Austrian nightclub, while another is located at a Swiss fairground, though it hasn't been displayed in years. A repainted statue can be seen in a now-abandoned theme park in South Africa, and another statue was restored in 2019 at an Italian amusement park and is currently for sale. </p>

          <p>Social media is rife with advice on lowering cortisol levels, a hormone released in response to stress, but experts caution against relying on these quick fixes. Many suggested remedies, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, lack scientific evidence and may not address the underlying causes of stress. One individual, Jasleen Kaur Carroll, experienced burnout and lupus flare-ups despite trying various social media hacks, leading her to seek therapy and mindfulness practices. Experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress, such as relationship problems or financial worries, and consulting medical professionals for sudden body changes that could indicate underlying health issues.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon accident in Praia Grande, southern Brazil, resulted in the deaths of eight people. The balloon had 21 people on board when a fire reportedly started inside the basket, prompting the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Some passengers jumped from the balloon, while others were unable to escape as the flames grew and the balloon rose again before crashing. The balloon tour company, Sobrevoar ServiÃ§os TurÃ­sticos, has suspended operations indefinitely and stated that it had complied with all regulations and had no prior accident history.</p>

          <p>Students are being urged to be vigilant against blackmail scams on dating apps, as fraud investigators report an increase in such cases. Scammers often use AI technology to trick victims into sending sexually explicit material, which is then used for blackmail. Authorities advise students to seek trusted friends' advice before sharing private images and to report any scams to the police. Nationwide, a UK building society, suggests looking out for odd phrases in conversations and searching profile photos to see if they are stock images, as well as urging anyone being blackmailed to report their case to the authorities for help and support.</p>

Leader Sir Ed Davey emphasized the need for Britain to be "war-ready" in light of Vladimir Putin's actions and Donald Trump's unpredictability, advocating for a public awareness campaign to prepare households for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The proposal anticipates increased defense spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, funded by an increase in the Digital Services Tax.</p>

          <p>Activist Mahmoud Khalil has pledged to continue protesting against Israel's war in Gaza following his release from a three-month detention at an immigration facility. Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, has become a symbol of President Trump's clampdown on campus protests. He asserted that the U.S. government and Columbia University are complicit in the conflict and expressed his commitment to advocating for immigrants' rights. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned Khalil's detention as a violation of the First Amendment.</p>

While the DNC points to a surge in grassroots support and record individual donations since February, some Democrats express concern about the party's direction.
