          <p>President Trump accused China of violating the preliminary trade agreement between the two countries, a claim made shortly after Treasury Secretary Bessent noted stalled trade talks. The accusation led to a drop in stock futures and introduces uncertainty into the trade relationship. The U.S. and China had previously agreed to a 90-day suspension on most tariffs, but tensions appear to be resurfacing with Trump's recent statement. This development could have implications for global markets and the broader economic outlook. Optimism regarding a resolution to the trade dispute may diminish as a result of this renewed conflict.

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 attacks, has died at the age of 69 after a battle with illness.

Despite his distinguished career, Kerik's reputation was tarnished when he pleaded guilty to federal corruption and tax crimes in 2009, serving three years in prison before being pardoned by President Trump in 2020. His leadership during a critical moment in the city's history remains a significant part of his legacy.</p>

          <p>A Harvard graduate student, Fangzhou Jiang, expressed concerns about the uncertainty faced by international students due to the Trump administration's actions targeting international enrollment. Jiang described a "devastating" atmosphere on campus, with students worried about their ability to remain in the United States. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's attempts to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students, providing temporary relief. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to Harvard and expressed interest in revoking the university's tax-exempt status, escalating tensions further. The student remains confident that the university will be able to provide measures to help international students finish their education at Harvard.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that U.S.-China trade talks have stalled and require direct intervention from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Despite a breakthrough agreement reached in Switzerland on May 12 to roll back tariff increases, the U.S. has continued tech restrictions on Beijing, while China has not eased restrictions on rare earths. Bessent believes the magnitude and complexity of the talks necessitate involvement from both leaders, emphasizing their good relationship. Analysts suggest China may only agree to a call if there is certainty of no surprises from the U.S. during the conversation, which could be critical to future trade negotiations.</p>

Core inflation dipped slightly, while services inflation eased sharply, and energy prices fell for the second consecutive month. Despite ongoing uncertainty about Germany's economic outlook due to domestic and global issues, the consumer price index has been closing in on the ECB's target.

This dismissal signals a potential shift in regulatory approach toward the crypto industry, especially as the Trump administration is perceived to be more friendly to the industry.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly attempting a "reverse Nixon" strategy, aiming to draw Russia closer to the United States to gain an advantage in geopolitical competition with China. This approach seeks to isolate China, ensure European security, and solidify American global primacy, but it carries significant risks. Analysts suggest that the bond between Russia and China, driven by shared interests and mutual antipathy toward the United States, may be too strong to break. A failed attempt could fracture the American alliance with Europe without effectively splitting Russia from China, potentially strengthening both Putin and Xi.</p>

          <p>Christina Ramberg's art explores the contradictions of femininity through paintings that focus on the artifice of the female body and the ways women construct themselves. Her work, which emerged in the late 1960s, features torsos in corsets, feet in high heels, and intricately arranged hairstyles, often cropped and depersonalized. Ramberg's paintings delve into the interplay between unruly and taming forces, reflecting the consumer products that divide women's bodies into conquerable parts. The artist's exploration of hidden desires and the constraints of the domestic realm offers a unique perspective on the complexities of female identity and self-presentation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erica Benner, a political philosopher, challenges the popular view of Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, suggesting that his famous work, *The Prince*, is a satirical critique of authoritarian power. She argues that Machiavelli was a republican who believed in shared power and warned against the dangers of inequality and partisanship. Benner suggests that Machiavelli's writings offer insights into contemporary politics, particularly regarding the fragility of democracies and the importance of appearance over truth. Machiavelliâ€™s work encourages a study of human nature to develop a human morality that fosters coexistence.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that premium TV, especially live sports, is being pirated at an "industrial scale" due to a lack of action by big tech firms. Enders Analysis accuses Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft of "ambivalence and inertia" regarding the issue, which costs broadcasters revenue and increases users' risk of cyber-crime. The report identifies Amazon's Fire Stick as a significant piracy enabler, allowing access to illegal streams, and highlights the financial crisis the broadcast industry faces due to piracy. The report also warns that users accessing illegal streams risk providing personal information, making them vulnerable to malware and phishing scams.</p>

The government aims to ensure that wealthier individuals do not receive subsidies for their energy bills, but details on the eligibility threshold are still under review.

The company's original goal was to develop AI that is "safe" and "benefits all of humanity," but its recent focus on commercial ventures has sparked controversy. While OpenAI initially planned to transition to a for-profit structure, concerns from investors, experts, and regulators led to a revised plan where the nonprofit remains in charge.
