          <p>China commemorated the 80th anniversary of World War II's conclusion with a grand military parade in Beijing, showcasing its latest weaponry, including missiles, tanks, and fighter jets, alongside goose-stepping soldiers and roaring aircraft. President Xi Jinping presided over the elaborate event, delivering a speech and reviewing the People's Liberation Army. Notably, leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un were among the two dozen foreign dignitaries present, while Western leaders were largely absent. This highly choreographed display was designed to project China's increasing military strength on the global stage and reinforce its narrative of historical victory against fascism, drawing significant international attention to its geopolitical alliances.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing an emerging branding supercycle, indicating a future where Chinese brands gain significant global recognition beyond niche consumer items like the popular Labubu doll. Companies such as Pop Mart, with its US$4 billion sales forecast, are demonstrating a growing trust in Chinese products, fundamentally shifting global perceptions from "cheap" to quality and innovation. This trend extends into critical industrial sectors, including electric vehicle batteries (CATL), automobiles (Xiaomi), drones, and biotech, where Chinese firms are increasingly competing on trust and unique insights rather than solely on cost advantage. This article suggests a profound and broad transformation in the global perception and market penetration of Chinese businesses, marking a new era of international brand power.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring losses on Wall Street, as investors reacted to rising global bond yields and ongoing trade developments. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell ahead of its GDP release, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices also decreased, with Japanese Government Bond yields notably increasing to multi-year highs. The Kospi index in South Korea remained flat, and Hong Kong futures pointed to a weaker open, reflecting broader market anxieties. Additionally, Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming speech at a military parade was a point of focus, adding a geopolitical dimension to the economic considerations for the region.

          <p>A US congressional panel has released over 33,000 pages of documents related to the federal investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including flight logs, surveillance video, and emails. Despite the large volume, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers acknowledged that the files contained little new information, with one Democrat stating 97% was already public. The release included video footage from outside Epstein's jail cell on the night of his death, but notably still lacked the "missing minute" that has fueled conspiracy theories. This action comes amid growing public demand for transparency, yet critics argue it offers minimal fresh insight into the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, has publicly challenged the UK government's new policy to restrict a civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." Gray, who hails from a working-class background herself, questioned the evidence supporting this decision, arguing that exposure to a wider range of people from different walks of life is crucial for personal and professional development. While the government asserts the change will attract more working-class young people and ensure the civil service reflects the country, critics, including other peers, contend that the new criteria could inadvertently discriminate against children from various professions within the working class. This article underscores a significant debate over the definition of meritocracy and the most effective pathways to inclusivity within public service.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is bracing Chicago residents for a potential federal incursion, including possible National Guard deployment and immigration raids, following ambiguous threats from President Trump regarding crime and immigration. Pritzker, alongside other local leaders, condemned Trump's actions as political and authoritarian, citing intelligence suggesting the staging of Texas National Guard troops for Illinois. This move comes despite a recent federal judge's injunction against similar deployments in California. Pritzker urged Chicagoans to remain peaceful, know their rights, and document any federal actions, emphasizing that the state is prepared to legally challenge such deployments, which he views as jeopardizing recent progress in reducing city violence.</p>

The elaborate event in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square will serve as a powerful platform to display China's growing military might, featuring advanced weaponry like hypersonic missiles, fighter jets, and underwater drones. Over two dozen world leaders, most notably Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, are expected to attend, marking their first joint public appearance and solidifying key alliances. This parade is a significant geopolitical statement, highlighting China's increasing global influence and its strategic partnerships, which some Western analysts have controversially labeled an "Axis of Upheaval."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stark warning, claiming the United States could become a "third world country" if his signature tariff policy is overturned, following a federal appeals court ruling that his use of emergency powers for tariffs broke the law. The administration plans to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court, seeking an expedited ruling, while the tariffs currently remain in effect. Investors are closely monitoring the situation, weighing the significant possibility of a Supreme Court decision against Trump. Such a ruling would introduce substantial uncertainty for thousands of American businesses and necessitate the return of most of the $142 billion in tariff revenue collected this fiscal year, potentially exacerbating federal budget and deficit concerns.

          <p>Nearly 25 years after the 9/11 attacks, new secondary barriers are finally being implemented in airline cockpits, providing an essential additional layer of security for flight crews and passengers. These retractable folding doors, now seen in new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for airlines like Southwest, effectively block off the front galley and flight deck, offering a significantly more secure alternative to temporary measures like beverage carts. Mandated by Congress in 2018, this crucial regulation is set to take effect next year, though the process for retrofitting existing planes still awaits Federal Aviation Administration certification. Pilot unions consistently emphasize the critical and ongoing need for these barriers, citing at least 52 hijacking attempts worldwide since 2001, underscoring the continuous efforts to enhance aviation safety.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Cannot Fully Assess Cost of Afghan Data Breach, Watchdog Reports</h2>

          <p>The UK government is unable to accurately calculate the total cost of a secret relocation plan established following a massive data leak involving Afghan individuals, according to the public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO). The Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates the breach and the new Afghanistan Response Route (ARR) scheme to cost £850 million, but the NAO lacks confidence in this figure, noting it excludes legal expenses and potential compensation claims. The data breach, which exposed sensitive details of almost 19,000 Afghans who cooperated with British forces, necessitated the ARR scheme to resettle an additional 7,000 people. This incident highlights significant financial and ethical implications, raising questions about accountability and the government's handling of vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <h2>Waxworms Discovered to Rapidly Digest Plastic, Offering Hope for Pollution Crisis</h2>

          <p>Scientists have made a potentially groundbreaking discovery: waxworms can digest polyethylene, the most common type of plastic, and convert it into body fat within days. Researchers found that approximately 2,000 waxworms can break down an entire plastic bag in just 24 hours, a process compared to humans eating steak. While the worms cannot survive solely on plastic, becoming weak over time, scientists are optimistic about developing a co-supplementation diet to maintain their health while they process waste. This finding offers a promising biological approach to mitigating the global plastic pollution crisis, which sees millions of tons of plastic accumulate annually, breaking down into harmful microplastics.</p>

          <p>Valentine Low's new book, "Power and the Palace," offers several revealing claims about the British royal family's interactions with politics and personal lives. Among the anecdotes, it details Queen Camilla's experience fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager, a story she shared with Boris Johnson. The book also suggests Queen Elizabeth II was instinctively against Brexit, seeing it as undermining the post-war settlement. Further insights include King Charles III's frosty relationship with Boris Johnson, behind-the-scenes negotiations over royal funding, and the government's push for a "maximalist" Coronation despite the Palace's initial caution. This article provides a glimpse into the complexities of royal life and political influence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that 11 people died in a US strike on what he described as a Venezuelan gang's drug-carrying vessel in the southern Caribbean. Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that the drugs were likely headed to Trinidad or other Caribbean nations, emphasizing the administration's offensive against drug cartels. Trump later posted a video of a vessel exploding, claiming the crew were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which he alleged is controlled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. This operation marks the first US military action in the region to crack down on drug trafficking, amidst increased US naval presence and tensions with Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 330 feet into the sky from its summit crater, marking the 32nd such episode since December 2024. All lava from this ongoing eruption has remained safely contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, posing no immediate threat to nearby communities. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from deep within the Earth, building pressure until it erupts, often in spectacular fountains due to narrow vents. Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has a history of such repeated eruptions, and while scientists can predict eruptions days in advance using seismic and ground deformation data, the ultimate duration or change in its behavior remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Safer Living Foundation, a Nottingham-based charity that provided a safe space and support for individuals convicted of sexual offenses post-release, has been forced to close due to a critical lack of funding. The program boasted an impressive reoffending rate of just 2% for its participants, significantly lower than the national average of 15.1%, clearly demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing further harm and protecting potential victims. The closure underscores a societal reluctance to fund sex offender treatment, despite the compelling evidence that such rehabilitation can be a highly effective way to reduce crime. This article raises critical questions about the UK's current approach to preventing reoffending and the urgent need for more comprehensive, community-based support.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares surged 8% in extended trading after Google largely avoided the most severe penalties in its landmark antitrust case, where it was previously found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rejected demands for the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser or Android operating system, which the Department of Justice had sought. While Google will not be barred from making payments for default placement, the court imposed limits on how it distributes services and requires sharing certain search index and user interaction data with rivals. This outcome is seen as a significant win for Google and its distribution partners like Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a scathing opinion, concluding that the Trump administration illegally deployed National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles, a "serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act." Judge Charles Breyer's ruling in a suit brought by California Governor Gavin Newsom, highlights the administration's efforts to circumvent the law, which bars the military from domestic law enforcement. The decision, though specific to California, holds significant implications as Trump has signaled similar deployments for other cities. Breyer's "scolding" provides a crucial explanation of why the administration's expansive views of presidential power are dangerous, potentially undermining constitutional principles and civilian control over the military.</p>

          <p>Protests targeting travelers are intensifying globally, fueled by growing local anger over "overtourism" and its impact on housing costs and quality of life. Incidents range from demonstrators shouting "Gringos leave" in Mexico City to blocking hotel entrances in Barcelona. Residents, having experienced their cities without tourists during the pandemic, are now reacting to pre-pandemic or even higher visitor levels. Experts suggest these protests are often a last resort when residents feel unheard by fragmented tourism policymaking, leading to tourists becoming scapegoats for deeper systemic issues. While such confrontations can deter some travelers temporarily, they primarily aim to raise awareness and pressure governments for meaningful change.</p>

Experts warn of a "chilling effect" on military leaders, pressured to prioritize allegiance to Trump over their constitutional oath, potentially undermining judicial orders.

This leadership change reflects a broader disillusionment with established parties, benefiting those perceived as outside the mainstream. The article explores the potential challenges for Labour, already facing pressure from Reform UK and Nigel Farage, as Polanski's Greens and emerging independent left-wing figures like Jeremy Corbyn could further fragment their supporter base. This article examines whether the Greens can maintain their previously broad coalition of support across urban and rural areas, or if their new, more assertive left-wing direction will narrow their appeal and potentially lead to internal conflicts or cannibalization of votes.</p>
