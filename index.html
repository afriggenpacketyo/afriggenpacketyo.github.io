          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape analyzes the current political climate, which he terms an era of "violent populism." Citing recent assassination attempts and successful assassinations of political figures, Pape presents survey data showing a rising acceptance of political violence on both the left and right. He argues that the root cause is not the internet, but rather a profound social change as the U.S. transitions to a white-minority democracy, a demographic shift that fuels deep-seated grievances and radicalizes politics.</p>

          <p>The concluding stage of the Vuelta a Espana was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid, knocking down barriers and occupying the road. The disruption led organizers to declare the race officially over, with Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading, named the winner. The protests, which have occurred throughout the tour in response to the participation of the Israel-Premier Tech team, escalated into clashes with police after the race was called off.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Chris Coons described the internet as a key "accelerant" driving political extremism in the United States following Charlie Kirk's assassination. Appearing alongside Republican Senator James Lankford in a call for bipartisanship, Coons argued that online algorithms push people toward the most extreme and angry content, making civil discourse increasingly difficult. Both senators advocated for legislative action, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate some of the harms fueled by social media and online platforms.</p>

          <h2>Banks and Credit Card Companies Grow Cautious of 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is posing a significant challenge to traditional credit card companies and banks. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, divert transactions and revenue from credit cards. Financial institutions are also wary because BNPL usage creates a significant blind spot in a consumer's credit profile, making it difficult to accurately assess their overall debt and creditworthiness.

          <p>This article presents a poem by Ashley M. Jones titled "In the Beginning, There Was the Word," from her new book, "Lullaby for the Grieving." The poem reflects on the enduring power of language, faith, and song for Black Americans, tracing a line from the transatlantic slave trade to the Civil Rights Movement and contemporary artistic expression. It portrays the spoken and created "word" as a source of divine strength, a tool for creation, and a "torch" carried proudly by a resilient people.</p>

The visit is intended to balance U.S. irritation over the attack with broader affirmations of support for Israeli security amid rising international pressure.</p>
