          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is implementing a reorganization of the State Department that involves closing 132 agency offices and eliminating approximately 700 D.C.-based civil and foreign service positions. The plan targets offices under the department’s Energy Resources, Conflict and Stabilization Operations wings, and several others related to science, technology, criminal justice, religious freedoms, trafficking, women's issues, and global partnerships. A senior State Department official stated that no immediate layoffs are expected, and affected employees will likely be moved to other areas within the department. The Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability bureau will be merged with the International Security and Nonproliferation Bureau.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has requested the Justice Department, now under President Trump, to pursue criminal charges against former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for allegedly lying to Congress about his handling of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. Comer asserts that Cuomo made "multiple criminally false statements" regarding the 2020 scandal, specifically concerning a directive that mandated nursing homes to admit potentially COVID-19 positive patients. Cuomo's spokesman dismissed the referral as a meritless political maneuver, while Comer insists that lying to Congress is a federal crime that must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The investigation stems from a report that allegedly undercounted nursing home deaths by as much as 50%.</p>

          <p>Ronnie O'Sullivan returned to competitive snooker at the World Championship, taking a 5-4 lead over Ali Carter after the first session. O'Sullivan, who had previously withdrawn from tournaments to prioritize his mental health, displayed strong form with a century break of 107. Despite nearly securing another century, he missed a shot, allowing Carter to win the final frame of the session. O'Sullivan expressed that simply competing in the tournament was an achievement, highlighting his ongoing mental health struggles, as he aims to surpass Stephen Hendry's record and secure his eighth world title.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, reflecting a broader trend among investors. The survey highlights Tesla's stock struggles and suggests that Musk's controversial political activities, including support for President Donald Trump and Republican policies, may be alienating potential buyers. The data reveals a significant polarization, with Democrats and independents holding strongly negative views of Musk, while Republicans view him positively. Despite the growing popularity of electric vehicles, Tesla faces challenges in appealing to key demographic groups, particularly young people and Democrats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks rebounded strongly on Tuesday, recovering from a significant sell-off triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose substantially, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures also showed gains. Investors had previously sold off shares following Trump's remarks, which raised concerns about the Fed's independence and trade policy uncertainty. Market analysts suggest that the potential for a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Congressional Republicans contributed to the market's recovery. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its U.S. economic growth forecast, citing the escalating trade war and policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla short sellers have amassed $11.5 billion in profits this year as the company's stock price plummeted, fueled by concerns over tariffs, competition, and CEO Elon Musk's involvement in the Trump administration. Tesla shares have dropped significantly, especially in the first quarter, due to worries that tariffs will increase the cost of essential parts and materials for EV production. The company faces challenges from lower-cost competitors in China and lags in the robotaxi market. Despite Musk's history of antagonism towards short sellers, they have profited significantly from Tesla's recent struggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that President Trump's tariffs will significantly slow global economic growth, predicting higher inflation and reducing the 2025 forecast to 2.8%.

The IMF also cautioned that rising bond yields and global tensions could further destabilize the financial system. Germany's economic growth forecast for 2025 was cut to 0.0%.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that he anticipates a "de-escalation" in President Trump's trade war with China in the "very near future." Bessent believes that the current status quo, with high tariff rates, is unsustainable and that the prospect of de-escalation should provide relief to markets. He also clarified that the goal of Trump's policy is not to decouple the U.S. and Chinese economies, despite the escalating tariffs. Bessent acknowledged that negotiations with China are likely to be a slow process, but emphasized that neither side believes the current situation is viable.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that people primarily use Google for web searches due to a lack of exposure to alternatives. An experiment involving paying people to use Bing for two weeks showed that some continued using it even after the payments stopped, suggesting that users may not realize Google's superiority. Inspired by this research, the government, which successfully sued Google for illegal monopoly in web search, is considering incentivizing consumers to try alternative search engines like Microsoft Bing. The aim is to reduce Google's dominance by encouraging informed choices.</p>
