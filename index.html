          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with top congressional leaders on Monday to negotiate a spending bill, aiming to avert a government shutdown by the October 1 deadline. The meeting includes Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. This comes after Trump initially canceled a meeting, calling Democratic demands "unserious." Democrats are pushing for health care provisions and a rollback of Medicaid cuts, while the White House has instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential layoffs if a shutdown occurs.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have resulted in at least 91 deaths across Gaza, according to hospital sources, as international calls for a ceasefire intensify. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, affirmed his commitment to continue the war against Hamas during a UN address, prompting a walkout by delegates. The attacks have severely impacted humanitarian conditions, with hospitals on the brink of collapse and food supplies dwindling in northern Gaza. This renewed violence follows Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and led to hostage-taking, with many still held captive.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and home builders are cautioning that millions of Americans could lose flood insurance coverage if Democrats do not support a House-passed spending bill that includes reauthorization for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). With the Sept. 30 funding deadline approaching, the White House argues that Democrats' refusal to back the measure, citing broader spending disputes, jeopardizes homeowners during hurricane season. A lapse in NFIP authorization could disrupt thousands of property sales daily and leave over 250,000 households without coverage, despite FEMA having some reserves. This issue highlights the recurring challenge of short-term NFIP extensions.</p>

          <p>Britain has successfully harvested its first-ever rice crop, cultivated in Cambridgeshire as part of an ambitious trial by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. This experiment, initially met with skepticism, thrived during the UK's hottest summer on record, suggesting new agricultural possibilities amidst climate change. Beyond food production, growing rice on peat soils could help lock in greenhouse gases, addressing a significant source of national emissions. While commercial viability is still distant, this project explores innovative ways to protect farming livelihoods and food supplies while mitigating environmental impacts.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley defended American Ryder Cup fans as merely 'passionate,' despite reports of unacceptable and personal insults directed at European players during day two at Bethpage Black. His stance contrasted sharply with European captain Luke Donald, who criticized the galleries for crossing the line with personal attacks and disruptions. McIlroy and Lowry, who secured a fourball victory, were subjected to heckling that required state troopers to line the holes.

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sanctions on Iran, further isolating the Islamic Republic and deepening its economic crisis, which is driving up food prices and increasing public anxiety. The "snapback" mechanism, part of the 2015 nuclear deal, freezes Iranian assets and halts arms deals, taking effect despite Iran's protests and Russian opposition. This move comes as Iran's rial currency hits record lows, and fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the U.S. persist. Activists also report a surge in executions, making this a challenging period for the Iranian populace.</p>

The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear in minutes, effectively eliminating the smell. This quirky research, discovered by the Ig Nobel committee, highlights an everyday problem with a practical, if unconventional, scientific solution.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is intensifying training for its National Bolivarian Militia, a civilian force, in response to what President Nicolás Maduro describes as a "non-declared war" by the US. This follows US navy strikes in the South Caribbean, which destroyed boats allegedly carrying drugs and killed at least 17 people. The US, which does not recognize Maduro's re-election, has labeled a Venezuelan criminal gang as terrorist and increased a reward for Maduro's capture. Experts suggest Maduro's move aims to increase potential human costs of any US military action, creating a "human shield" despite the militia's limited combat experience.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate among dermatologists. While collagen is vital for skin and joint health, its journey through the body after oral ingestion, even in peptide form, is complex and uncertain. Topical collagen creams are generally dismissed as ineffective, as they don't penetrate beyond the skin's outer layer. Some industry-funded studies suggest benefits, but independent research often finds no substantial effect. Experts recommend sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful strategies for skin health than expensive supplements.</p>

          <p>Bali, long celebrated as a tropical paradise, is increasingly disappointing tourists as its idealized social media image clashes with the reality of overcrowding, traffic, and rampant construction. Recent floods, exacerbated by poor waste management and unchecked urban development, have highlighted the island's growing strain. While some locals lament the erosion of Bali's natural beauty and cultural richness, others point out the irony of tourists complaining about crowds they contribute to. Authorities are now attempting to regulate tourism and promote sustainable practices, but many believe interventions are too late for this victim of its own success.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether China has surpassed Europe in the race for a high-tech future, coinciding with 50 years of diplomatic relations between China and the European Union. Decades ago, Chinese officials observed their country was significantly behind Europe in science and technology. However, China's subsequent reform and opening-up policies have fueled decades of rapid growth, transforming its technological landscape. This historical context provides a backdrop for evaluating China's current position and its implications for Europe's competitive standing in the global technology arena.</p>

          <p>Labour has committed to beginning construction on three new towns before the next general election, with 12 potential locations identified across England. Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London are among the most promising sites. This initiative is central to Labour's vision for economic growth, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, with at least 40% designated as affordable housing. The plan involves a New Towns Unit to secure funding for essential services and utilize development corporations with special planning powers, mirroring the successful regeneration of Stratford.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, and authorized the use of "Full Force" if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump stated the move aims to protect ICE facilities from 'Antifa and other domestic terrorists,' a designation Democratic lawmakers dispute. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and other officials have pushed back, stating there is no need for federal troops and calling any deployment an 'abuse of power.' The announcement marks an escalation in the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and perceived domestic threats.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a powerful Category 5 storm, is swirling north of the Caribbean and could potentially interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, creating a rare Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon involves two storms merging or spinning around a common center, though its outcome depends on their relative strengths. While an interaction is unlikely to result in a tangled 'dance' given Humberto's strength, forecasters are monitoring its path towards Bermuda. The second system, Tropical Depression Imelda, is expected to strengthen and bring heavy rainfall to the Bahamas and southeastern U.S. coastline.</p>

This article argues that China's global initiatives could offer a path to necessary UN reform, contrasting with the contradictions of traditional powers. Germany, for instance, a key arms supplier to Israel, embodies the challenges of current international dynamics. The piece suggests that while Western allies enable conflicts, China's approach might represent a more substantive reform model for the multilateral institution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted a cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him "YOU'RE FIRED!". This action reiterates Trump's ongoing criticism of Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite the central bank recently lowering rates for the first time this year. While no U.S. president has ever successfully fired a Fed chair, Trump has previously attempted to remove other Fed officials. Economists and investors fear such a move could undermine the Fed's independence and potentially lead to higher longer-term interest rates, although markets have shown little immediate reaction.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey marks a significant escalation in President Trump's campaign of political retribution against perceived enemies. Despite Trump's initial promises to end the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department, his actions, including this indictment, are seen by allies as targeting those who 'deserve it.' The case against Comey, concerning alleged false statements about a Clinton Foundation investigation, appears thin, having been previously investigated by the inspector general. This move aligns with Trump's broader efforts to exert control over various aspects of society, from media to federal agencies.</p>
