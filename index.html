        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight female college athletes are contesting the House v. NCAA antitrust settlement, alleging it violates Title IX by unfairly distributing back pay. They argue that the settlement favors football and basketball programs, depriving female athletes of $1.1 billion in rightful compensation. The athletes claim the calculation of past damages is inaccurate and would cause irreparable harm to women's sports. Their appeal will be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, focusing on the argument that the settlement disproportionately benefits revenue-generating sports at the expense of female athletes and other sports. The future of fair compensation within collegiate athletics is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Spending Review emphasizes long-term capital spending while limiting day-to-day expenditures. The government aims to stimulate economic potential through infrastructure projects but faces the challenge of immediate public needs and volatile politics. Critics argue that this approach prioritizes long-term gains over short-term relief for citizens feeling financially strained. The review includes expectations of higher council taxes to fund the police, with more details on infrastructure plans expected soon. The government hopes to badge this moment as a turning point, rebuilding the nation after fixing the foundations.</p>

          <p>China has approved the AG600, the world's largest amphibious aircraft, for mass production, marking progress in its aviation industry. The Civil Aviation Administration of China certified that the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China has a reliable system for consistent production meeting safety standards. This development is part of China's effort to build a self-reliant civil aviation industry, especially given US technology restrictions. The AG600 is designed for emergency rescue and natural disaster prevention, joining the Y-20 strategic transport plane and C919 airliner in China's domestically developed large aircraft fleet. This is a move towards a more standardized civil aviation manufacturing sector.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong aims to become a leader in the stablecoin market with its new comprehensive stablecoin law, effective August 1. This law puts Hong Kong ahead of the US and Singapore in regulating cryptocurrencies backed by assets like the US dollar. The move is expected to attract digital asset firms and promote innovation in the region, particularly with the city's large offshore yuan holdings. Experts believe this could position Hong Kong as a key player in the global stablecoin market, currently dominated by US dollar-backed tokens. This underscores the intensifying East-West contest over financial influence in the digital era.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. officials, Israel is reportedly prepared to launch an operation into Iran, leading the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation on American sites in Iraq. This anticipation is a contributing factor to the State Department's recent advisory for non-emergency government officials to leave Iraq. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still scheduled to meet with Iran for further nuclear program talks. President Trump has reiterated that the U.S. will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weapons, adding to the uncertainty of the situation. The situation remains tense.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new tyrannosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum, which alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. This 86-million-year-old species is considered the closest known ancestor to all tyrannosaurs, including T.rex. Khankhuuluu, meaning Dragon Prince of Mongolia, represents a transitional fossil between small, fleet-footed predators and the giant tyrannosaurs. Weighing around 750kg, it exhibits early evolutionary stages of features crucial for tyrannosaurs, such as skull anatomy for a strong jaw. The discovery revises the tyrannosaur family tree, providing insights into the evolution of these apex predators.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States could extend a 90-day pause on implementing tariffs for major trading partners if they negotiate in good faith. Bessent stated that countries engaging in constructive negotiations are likely to have the pause extended. The Trump administration has been in talks with 18 trading partners, including Japan, towards potential trade deals. Japan's chief tariff negotiator is scheduled for further talks with U.S. officials before a meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump.
