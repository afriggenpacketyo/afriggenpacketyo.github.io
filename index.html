          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old British teenager, has died in a car crash in north London just three months after being released from a Dubai prison. Fakana had received a royal pardon in July after being sentenced for a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl. He was a passenger in a vehicle that crashed following a brief 60-second police chase in Tottenham. The driver of the car has since been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and other offenses, and the incident has been referred to the police professional standards directorate.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has continued her vocal criticism of WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert, accusing the league's leadership of being disconnected from the sport and acting out of self-interest. In her podcast, Cunningham stated that players are "fed up" with the league's treatment and lack of engagement, particularly during the ongoing collective bargaining agreement negotiations. She argued that Engelbert is not a "great leader" and is more focused on her own accomplishments than on respecting the players who are the league's main product. Engelbert has denied some specific allegations made by other players.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 335 individuals during a protest in support of Palestine Action, a group proscribed by the UK government. The demonstration in Trafalgar Square proceeded despite calls from police and political figures to postpone it following a recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers from Defend Our Juries defended the decision, stating that canceling the event would be letting terror win and that it is possible to grieve for multiple tragedies at once. The majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization, with police noting the process was slowed by protesters refusing to cooperate.</p>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a substantially reduced price. Members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket can purchase a four-week supply for $499, approximately half the typical cost. This initiative aims to provide an affordable and authentic alternative to the cheaper, unregulated compounded versions of the drugs that have become prevalent due to high demand and limited insurance coverage. The move could significantly increase access to these medications for a wider population.</p>

The 3,000-year-old tomb is one of the largest in the necropolis and features exquisite wall paintings, although its contents were looted long ago. The Japanese-led restoration project involved over 260 specialists who worked to combat severe deterioration and conserve the site to the highest international standards.

Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic noted that while President Trump may not have chosen this shutdown, he appears to embrace the political fight, believing it benefits him and the Republican party. There is also speculation that the shutdown is being used as an opportunity to advance the goal of deconstructing the administrative state. However, some within Trump's circle reportedly fear potential public blowback from such actions if the shutdown persists.</p>

This prospect has drawn criticism due to Blair's controversial history in the region, including his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his previous tenure as a Middle East envoy.

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 deaths, were held to demand lower prices for wheat and electricity and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands and pledged improvements in public services. The alliance's leader urged demonstrators to disperse, expressing gratitude to Pakistan's Prime Minister for addressing their concerns.</p>

          <p>A journal affiliated with the Chinese military has detailed the country's new generation of unmanned underwater systems, describing them as "disruptive" and intelligent. The article claims these systems can operate with stealth, producing less than 90 decibels of sound to evade enemy sonar detection. Furthermore, the technology can be integrated with submarine-launched missiles and smart mines to create a comprehensive, multilayered strike network. The report indicates a significant advancement in the People's Liberation Army Navy's unmanned capabilities, including new submersibles and surface vessels.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has left the national park system in a state of confusion, with many parks operating with skeleton crews or closing large sections to the public. While an Interior Department contingency plan aims to keep roads and trails accessible, the furlough of thousands of employees means services like maintenance, fee collection, and visitor support are suspended. This situation has led to visitor frustration and raises concerns about safety and environmental damage, echoing problems from the 2018 shutdown, such as vandalism and sanitation issues. Gateway communities that rely on park tourism are also facing significant economic losses.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain due to a sharp decline in international student enrollment, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies. Universities like Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, have seen international student numbers plummet, resulting in potential revenue losses of over $140 million. Stricter visa screening processes and fears of deportation have deterred many students, who are now choosing to study in other countries. This decline threatens the economies of less affluent towns that depend heavily on the financial contributions and cultural diversity these students bring.</p>

Labor unions are highlighting the disproportionate impact on these low-wage workers, who risk falling into debt or losing their homes.

Godfread, who also heads the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, emphasized that there is bipartisan, unanimous support among state regulators for extending the tax credits to maintain market stability and ensure consumers can afford coverage.</p>

          <p>Sources familiar with the matter report that the FBI is considering an arrest and public "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, following his recent indictment. An FBI agent was allegedly suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in the plan, which was described as unusual for a white-collar defendant. Comey was indicted last week on charges of lying to Congress, a move that followed public pressure from President Trump. While Comey's lawyers have agreed to bring him to his scheduled arraignment, some at the FBI are reportedly pushing for a more dramatic public arrest.</p>

The petition currently has 217 of the 218 required signatures. A spokesperson for the Speaker indicated Grijalva will be sworn in when the House returns to session after the government shutdown is resolved.</p>

          <p>In the two years following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 U.S. states have charged 412 people with pregnancy-related crimes, according to new research by the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice. Most cases involved low-income women and allegations of substance use during pregnancy, often using laws intended to protect children, not fetuses. This trend reflects a growing acceptance of "fetal personhood," which critics warn could lead to increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals for a wide range of behaviors deemed dangerous by the state.</p>

Bezos confidently predicted that if they did everything right, Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000.
