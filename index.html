          <p>A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The event initially triggered a tsunami advisory for Alaska's Aleutian Islands, which was later canceled. Russian officials in the Kamchatka region also issued a local tsunami warning, urging residents to be aware of the danger. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic event, and authorities confirmed no tsunami threat to Hawaii or Canada.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." This move, declared on his Truth Social platform, also includes a recommendation to investigate individuals and groups that allegedly fund it. The announcement echoes a similar threat made during his first term in 2020 that was never formally enacted. The renewed focus on antifa follows the recent fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Trump vowing to pursue those he deems responsible for political violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has been assigned a U.S. Secret Service protective detail in recent days, according to multiple sources. While the specific reasons were not officially disclosed, the decision comes in the wake of heightened security concerns following the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. It is uncommon for a press secretary to receive such protection, though it is not without precedent, as Sarah Huckabee Sanders had a temporary detail in 2018. The move coincides with congressional considerations for increased security funding for executive and judicial branch officials.</p>

          <p>During a news conference concluding his state visit to the UK, Donald Trump suggested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could deploy the military to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Trump stated he discussed border security with Starmer, drawing parallels to his own policies in the United States and emphasizing that any means necessary should be used to stop unlawful crossings. The US president warned that illegal immigration "destroys countries from within." Starmer responded by highlighting his government's existing efforts, including migrant return deals, while acknowledging there is "no silver bullet" to the complex issue.</p>

          <p>Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, veteran late-night host David Letterman strongly criticized the indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" following pressure from the Trump-appointed FCC chairman. Letterman, who has a long history of mocking presidents without government interference, warned of a shift towards "managed media," calling the situation "silly" and "ridiculous." He argued that media conglomerates should not bow to pressure from what he termed an "authoritarian—a criminal—administration."

The piece argues that a climate of fear is developing, where criticizing the government is discouraged and corporate entities may prioritize mergers over principles.

Perliger, a professor at UMass Lowell, argues that such events are better understood by examining the broader societal conditions that facilitate them, such as extreme political polarization and a loss of faith in political systems. He notes that assassins' motives are often complex and not always ideologically coherent. Instead of partisan blame-casting, he suggests focusing on how a dysfunctional political environment, where rivals are demonized, normalizes violence as a perceived solution.</p>

          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, envisioning a more natural user interface based on voice, gestures, and sight. The statement came as the company revealed its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display controlled by a neural wristband. This new model allows users to see messages and videos, a significant step up from previous audio-only versions. The push into advanced smart glasses comes as Meta faces growing competition in the wearable tech space from companies like Google, Snap, and reportedly Apple.</p>

          <p>A significant public dispute has broken out between the founders of a new UK left-wing political party, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana. Sultana accused Corbyn's allies of creating a "sexist boys' club" and sidelining her from key decisions, including the unauthorized launch of a membership drive. The conflict escalated when Corbyn's camp sent an email dismissing the membership portal Sultana had promoted, urging supporters to cancel payments and advising he was seeking legal advice. The internal clash, which includes accusations over financial control, has created turmoil and uncertainty just as the nascent party was attempting to build momentum.</p>

          <p>Hyundai Motor Group has reinforced its aggressive U.S. growth strategy, undeterred by a recent, large-scale immigration raid at its jointly-owned battery plant in Georgia. During an investor day in New York, CEO José Muñoz outlined plans to increase annual sales to 5.55 million vehicles by 2030, with the U.S. serving as the "engine of growth." The company aims to have over 80% of its U.S. vehicles produced locally by that year, which will include a new midsize pickup truck. Muñoz expressed empathy for the workers affected by the raid but confirmed the company's long-term investment and manufacturing plans in America remain on track.</p>

          <p>During an interview on Fox News, President Donald Trump attacked the network's polling as "the worst" after host Martha MacCallum confronted him with a poll showing 52% of respondents feel the economy is in worse shape under his administration. Rather than addressing the economic concerns directly, Trump dismissed the data and advised Rupert Murdoch to "get yourself a new pollster." He then pivoted to his tariff policies, insisting they would lead to a manufacturing boom within a year. The exchange highlights the president's continued sensitivity to unfavorable polling, even from a typically friendly network.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is being hailed as an electrifying and politically urgent thriller. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a former anti-fascist vigilante forced out of hiding, the movie is set in the present day and directly engages with themes of political violence and government overreach. The review praises the film for its breakneck pacing, beautifully shot action sequences, and powerful performances from DiCaprio, Sean Penn, and newcomer Chase Infiniti. It is described as a bleak but captivating vision of modern times that successfully melds genre storytelling with potent social commentary, marking a triumph for the director.</p>

The Trump administration has vowed to "go after" those engaging in "hate speech," with the State Department threatening to revoke visas and the Pentagon investigating service members for their social media posts. This government-led crackdown, culminating in pressure that led to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, is seen by First Amendment scholars as a dangerous precedent. Experts emphasize that most offensive speech is constitutionally protected and warn against the government using its power to suppress views it dislikes.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny revealed he intentionally avoided scheduling tour dates in the 50 U.S. states out of fear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "could be outside my concert," targeting his fans. Instead, the Puerto Rican artist, who is a U.S. citizen, performed 30 shows in Puerto Rico. The decision highlights a growing climate of uncertainty for performers, as foreign artists also face new logistical and financial hurdles in securing visas to work in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the singer's concerns as "fearmongering," but the move raises questions about whether other international acts will also bypass the United States.</p>
