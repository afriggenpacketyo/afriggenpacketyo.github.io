          <p>Emine Erdogan, Turkey's first lady, has issued a poignant appeal to Melania Trump, urging her to extend her advocacy for children to those suffering in Israel's war in Gaza. In a letter published by the Turkish presidency, Erdogan highlighted the dire humanitarian situation, describing Gaza as a "children's cemetery" and calling for unified international action against the injustice. This plea draws parallels to Trump's past support for Ukrainian children, emphasizing the urgent need for intervention as a UN-backed report declares famine in Gaza City. The article underscores the severe malnutrition threatening 132,000 children and the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on the region's population and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has officially formed southeast of Bermuda, following closely after Hurricane Erin. Forecasters from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center predict that Fernand is likely to strengthen over the weekend and could escalate into a hurricane by Monday, before gradually weakening by Tuesday. Crucially, the storm is expected to remain over the open ocean, posing no immediate threat of landfall or coastal impact. This development aligns with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season this year, predicting between 13 and 18 named storms, with five to nine expected to become hurricanes.</p>

During a candid TikTok Live session, Gosselin asserted that all the money under her control was indeed saved for her children's education, ensuring they have more than enough for college. She also dismissed accusations of estrangement from her daughter Hannah, confirming their ongoing communication and visits. Gosselin, who now works demanding 12-hour shifts as a pediatric nurse, explained that substantial legal fees from her high-profile divorce consumed much of her reality TV earnings.

          <p>Israeli strikes and shootings in Gaza have tragically killed at least 33 people, including displaced individuals sheltering in tents and those seeking scarce food aid, according to local hospitals. This escalating violence occurs as the world confronts an exceptional announcement from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) that famine is now gripping Gaza's largest city. The IPC's determination, its first in the Middle East, intensifies global pleas for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive, initiated in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023, attacks. Israel denies the famine declaration and continues preparations for a Gaza City offensive, while ceasefire efforts remain on hold. The article underscores the catastrophic hunger faced by nearly half a million people, with malnutrition-related deaths rising amidst widespread displacement and collapsed food production.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies ace pitcher Zack Wheeler is facing a significant setback, expected to be sidelined for six to eight months after being diagnosed with venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This condition will require additional surgery in the coming weeks, following a previous operation to remove a blood clot from his upper right arm. The extensive recovery period means Wheeler's ability to start the 2026 season on time is now in jeopardy. The 35-year-old had been enjoying a stellar 2025 season, boasting a 10-5 record with a 2.71 ERA and leading the National League with 195 strikeouts, making him a strong contender for the NL Cy Young Award for the third time.</p>

Currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in a sex-trafficking scheme, she further dismissed allegations of Prince Andrew's sexual relations with an underage girl as "mind-blowingly not conceivable." The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser, expressed outrage at the interview, accusing the government of providing Maxwell a platform to "rewrite history" and undermine survivors' experiences. Maxwell is reportedly seeking a pardon from Trump, though the White House denies any such leniency is being discussed.</p>

This shift is partly driven by stricter environmental regulations and excess industrial capacity within China, coupled with the allure of cheaper labor and weaker environmental enforcement in neighboring countries. While Beijing has become Southeast Asia's largest financier of clean energy projects, its capital also fuels nickel processing plants and rare earth mines, raising serious environmental concerns. Local protests and allegations of severe pollution, particularly in the Mekong River, highlight the challenges.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Los Angeles and 30 other "sanctuary" cities and counties. The ruling expands on an earlier decision, asserting that the administration's executive order, which sought to cut funding based on local cooperation with federal immigration agencies, is likely unconstitutional. These sanctuary policies typically limit local jurisdictions from committing resources to federal immigration enforcement efforts, though they do not impede federal operations. The White House, however, stated its intention to appeal the decision, arguing that sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement and compromise the safety and security of American citizens.

          <p>Tensions are rapidly escalating in Serbia as anti-corruption protests, initially sparked by a railway station canopy collapse, are increasingly met with police violence and arrests. The European Union, for which Serbia is a candidate for membership, has called for de-escalation and a thorough investigation into any excessive use of force, yet critics argue this response is insufficient. Some analysts suggest the EU's "strategy of appeasement" towards President Aleksandar Vucic's government has failed, influenced by strategic interests like access to Serbia's lithium reserves and concerns over its friendly relations with Russia. This article highlights the EU's difficult position in balancing geopolitical considerations with its commitment to upholding fundamental democratic values and human rights in the Western Balkan country.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's new white-knuckle thriller "Relay" features Riz Ahmed as Ash, a solitary, off-the-grid fixer who specializes in helping potential whistleblowers disappear from dangerous entities. Ash's unique modus operandi involves using a text-telephone relay service for traceless communication, maintaining complete anonymity. The film's "nifty premise" is praised as it follows Ash aiding biotech scientist Sarah (Lily James) on the run with incriminating documents. This article highlights the movie's smart, paranoid tone and its dizzyingly enjoyable cat-and-mouse chase, which evokes classic '70s thrillers. It also subtly questions whether making an uneasy peace with tormentors is a viable modern solution, offering a fascinatingly cynical update to the genre.</p>

          <p>The ongoing Ukraine war is significantly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, visibly diminishing Russia's long-standing influence as countries like Azerbaijan actively pursue new international alliances. A recent peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, notably mediated by US President Donald Trump, serves as a prominent indicator of these shifting power dynamics. While Russia officially welcomed the deal, some analysts within Russia view it as a "terrible humiliation" for Moscow. This article highlights how the war has created a "window of opportunity" for these states to develop more diversified, multi-vector foreign policies, reducing their dependence on Russia and fostering increased engagement with global powers such as the US and China.</p>

The state of Tennessee and the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions contend that this "arbitrary ethnic threshold" discriminates against other institutions.

While the SPD also acknowledges the need for reforms, they emphasize imaginative solutions rather than just cuts.
