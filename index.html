          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor for the first time in 34 years, now ranking second behind Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. While Japan's gross external assets rose to a record 533.05 trillion yen, Germany's assets totaled 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan's net external credit increased for the seventh consecutive year, driven by direct investment in the United States by domestic financial institutions and trading houses.

          <p>Shares of China's BYD experienced a decline after the electric vehicle manufacturer announced price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models through June. The price of the Seagull hatchback was reduced by 20%, while the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan saw a 34% price cut. Analysts anticipate that BYD's price reductions will lead to a surge in dealership store visits, but they do not foresee it significantly impacting competitors' market share.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, will cut approximately 3,000 office-based jobs, primarily in Sweden, as part of cost-cutting measures. The move is attributed to challenges facing the global motor industry, including tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales in Europe. The company's CEO, Håkan Samuelsson, cited the "challenging period" as the reason for the layoffs, while other automakers, like Nissan and BYD, have also announced job cuts and price reductions. This follows Volvo's earlier scaling back of its ambition to go fully electric by 2030 due to uncertainties created by tariffs on EVs.</p>

          <p>Official data indicates that China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. The improved profitability is attributed to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks, with the high-tech manufacturing industry experiencing notable growth. However, statisticians caution that constraints such as insufficient demand and declining prices still persist, alongside uncertainty in the external environment. (not investment advice)</p>

This announcement follows ICE arrests of nearly 200 people in Nashville, which prompted O'Connell to sign an executive order aimed at tracking interactions with federal immigration authorities, stating that the actions were not focused on making the community safer.</p>

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the current frenzy of wealthy individuals buying teams. The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of their team’s “intangible assets” over 15 years, which could raise nearly $1 billion over a decade. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and hurt current owners by slowing the growth of their investments. The White House claims the measure aims to eliminate an advantage for owners at a time when ticket prices are rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly moving their gold offshore to Singapore as economic and geopolitical uncertainty rises. The Reserve, a secure storage facility in Singapore, has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the same period last year, with 90% of new orders coming from outside of Singapore. Industry watchers attribute the surge to concerns over tariffs, global instability, and potential geopolitical issues. The wealthy are also opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to limit price exposure, with spot gold prices near historic levels.</p>

          <p>CNN anchor Jake Tapper stated that the cover-up of former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline was "maybe even worse than Watergate" due to Nixon being in control of his faculties when sober. Tapper said Biden showed routine signs of cognitive decline, including forgetting names, and that his wife Jill and son Hunter played key roles in keeping it a secret. He also said that there were "two Joe Bidens" and the "non-functioning" version was seen more often, which led to Biden ending his campaign after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024.</p>
