          <p>DoorDash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, aiming to enhance its local commerce capabilities and support financial goals. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $3.03 billion against an expected $3.09 billion, although this still represents a 21% increase from the previous year. Despite the revenue miss, DoorDash's total orders increased by 18% to 732 million, slightly below analyst predictions. The company anticipates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the second quarter to range from $600 million to $650 million.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates that the stock market will decline to new lows, even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China.

          <p>Congressional Republicans are considering curtailing or eliminating Medicaid provider taxes, a tactic states use to increase federal matching funds, potentially saving the federal government $600 billion over the next decade.

A recent analysis suggests that Republican-led states, which rely more on this strategy, could be the hardest hit. The article includes an interactive graphic illustrating how provider taxes work and notes that the federal government doesn't track all revenue associated with these taxes.</p>

Vizion's VP of strategic business development, Ben Tracy, indicates that nearly all U.S. exports have been affected, with significant declines also observed at major ports like Los Angeles and Savannah.
