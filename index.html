          <p>A driver deliberately rammed a car into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with seven reported in critical condition. The incident, which occurred early Saturday, is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department as an intentional act. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, with police discovering he had also been shot by a suspect who then fled the scene.</p>

          <p>Nearly 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the pro-Palestine activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protests took place in cities including London, Manchester, and Bristol, with many arrests made under the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive placards. The ban follows an incident where activists broke into an RAF base, causing millions in damages, and comes as the group's co-founder prepares to challenge the proscription in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Bristol Palin shared details about her ongoing battle with facial paralysis, stating the condition appeared suddenly without any prior symptoms or warning signs. In an Instagram Q&A, she explained that she woke up one morning with the left side of her face completely paralyzed and is now about 70% back to normal. Doctors suspect a potential case of Bell's palsy, possibly triggered by stress, and believe it could take another three months for a potential full recovery.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has addressed the growing pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, stating that unsealing grand jury transcripts would not satisfy his critics. In a social media post, Trump claimed that even with full court approval, "nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics." This statement follows a Department of Justice request, prompted by Trump, to unseal the testimonies, signaling that the president may not take further action on the matter despite the persistent campaign from his supporters.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing with the U.S. Small Business Administration. The filing was made shortly before a financing round valued the company at $9 billion. This designation is intended for businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to gain preferential access to federal contracts. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, asserting the company never applied for or received federal benefits.</p>

          <p>Economists are evaluating the impact of President Trump's tariff policies, noting both some successes and potential risks more than 100 days after their implementation. Analysts credit the tariffs with boosting tax revenue and encouraging some U.S. investment commitments from companies, but caution that these promises are long-term and could be withdrawn. Concerns remain that the tariffs, which have pushed the effective rate to its highest since 1910, are contributing to price increases and risk broader inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
