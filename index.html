          <p>Amazon clarified its position on displaying tariff surcharges after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the company for considering such a move, labeling it a hostile act. Amazon stated that displaying tariff surcharge pricing was never approved and would not happen. This occurred amidst concerns from Amazon sellers about the unsustainable nature of tariffs and their impact on prices. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos has been cozying up to Donald Trump since Trump won the presidential election, and the company's actions are interpreted as an attempt to avoid conflict with the White House.

          <p>Michigan Panthers wide receiver Samson Nacua, brother of Los Angeles Rams star Puka Nacua, has been suspended without pay for one game by the United Football League after slapping a St. Louis Battlehawks fan. The incident, captured on video, led to the suspension and a requirement for Nacua to participate in community service events arranged by the league. The UFL investigated the situation after the video went viral, and the league made the decision to suspend Nacua. The reason for the physical altercation remains unclear, though Nacua's teammate Adonis Alexander was present but not involved.</p>

This arrangement led to false claims for Gilead's drugs being paid for by federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair is calling for a major shift in net zero policies, asserting that current approaches relying on limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production are destined to fail. Blair's report argues that voters feel they are being asked to make financial sacrifices with minimal impact on global emissions. He emphasizes the need for rapid deployment of carbon capture technology, greater use of AI for energy grid efficiency, and investment in small-scale nuclear reactors. While Downing Street maintains its commitment to net zero, Blair's comments have sparked debate among political figures, with some seizing on his criticism and others dismissing it.</p>

          <p>With high credit card interest rates putting pressure on American households, more people are considering bankruptcy as a solution. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or liquidation bankruptcy, allows individuals to erase most unsecured debts, including credit card balances, by giving up non-exempt assets. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, or reorganization bankruptcy, involves setting up a repayment plan lasting three to five years to pay back some or all of the debt. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, and debt consolidation loans, and the best solution depends on an individual's financial situation.

          <p>Periods of extreme volatility in the stock market are often followed by strong stock returns, according to market analysts. The VIX index, which measures expected volatility in the S&P 500, has historically shown that when it spikes above 40, the S&P 500 has been up 30% a year later, on average. The odds of stock returns being positive 12 months later were also above 90% during these periods. This suggests that investors should consider holding onto or even buying more stocks during times of high volatility. (not investment advice)</p>
