          <p>As global markets react to President Trump's newly imposed tariffs, exchanges are employing circuit breakers to prevent extreme market crashes. These mechanisms halt trading for 15 minutes if the S&P 500 falls by 7% or 13% before 3:25 p.m. ET. A 20% drop suspends trading for the day. These measures, triggered by trade tensions, aim to allow investors to reassess positions during times of high volatility and prevent panic selling.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about an economic slowdown caused by President Trump's tariffs, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4%. This increase comes as traders anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in response to a weaker economy. The tariffs, which impose a 10% baseline duty on imports from over 180 countries, have sparked fears of a global trade war as major trading partners retaliate. Trump has downplayed the impact, stating that "sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something."</p>

          <p>A measles outbreak in the U.S. is affecting not only children but also a significant number of adults, who are more vulnerable to severe complications. Declining vaccination rates have led to a resurgence of the disease, with experts warning that the U.S. is likely to lose its measles-elimination status. Adults who were never vaccinated are particularly at risk, as measles becomes deadlier with age. The virus can also cause immune amnesia, making survivors susceptible to other diseases.</p>

          <p>The recent market sell-off driven by President Trump's tariffs has made it difficult to assess whether stocks are truly on sale. Traditional valuation methods, such as price-to-earnings multiples, are less reliable due to uncertainty surrounding earnings estimates. Investors are hesitant to pay the same multiples amid recession fears, and earnings estimates have not yet been fully recalibrated to account for the potential impact of tariffs. It's crucial to determine whether a stock's price decline is steeper than the expected decline in earnings before buying. (not investment advice)</p>
