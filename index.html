            <p>China's consumer prices have declined for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation has deepened, signaling rising deflationary pressures. This economic downturn comes as Chinese exporters brace for increased challenges due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S., including recently increased tariffs. Despite these challenges, core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, has shown signs of recovery, prompting some economists to anticipate a potential inflection point driven by policy stimulus measures aimed at boosting consumption. However, uncertainties surrounding oil prices and external demand may continue to exert deflationary pressure on producer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

The report highlights the importance of dramas like Adolescence to the country's identity and talent pipeline, which they say is now under threat.

            <p>China's consumer prices have fallen in March as the trade war with the US intensifies, with cumulative tariffs of 125% imposed on Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) declined 0.1% year on year, slightly less than expected. Food prices saw a decline, while service prices increased slightly. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% year on year.</p>

            <p>Amazon has postponed the launch of its first Kuiper internet satellites due to adverse weather conditions at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A United Launch Alliance rocket was scheduled to carry 27 Kuiper satellites into orbit, but "stubborn cumulus clouds" and high winds prevented the launch. Amazon aims to compete with SpaceX's Starlink in providing high-speed, low-latency internet via a constellation of satellites. The company faces a deadline from the FCC to have half of its constellation in orbit by July 2026.</p>

Beachgoers are still advised to avoid any fire-related debris encountered in the ocean or on the sand. High tides can carry fire debris into the ocean, creating hazardous conditions.</p>

            <p>The United States will not attend a key annual summit for the global shipbuilding industry, signaling a deepening rift in global maritime affairs. This absence underscores the US's increasingly isolated stance as it seeks to revitalize its maritime sector. The US has recently implemented aggressive policies targeting China's dominant shipyards, including steep fees for Chinese-linked ships entering American ports. These actions have sparked backlash and discussions about countermeasures within the industry.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade war is now more focused on China, with a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries but an increase to 125% for China. This move is seen as unfinished business from his first term, aiming to upend the global trade system centered on China. The article explores the history of trade relations with China and the reasons behind Trump's actions, questioning whether China will negotiate and whether the US still believes in free trade. The future depends on China's willingness to make major concessions and America's commitment to free trade.</p>
