          <p>Small business owners are struggling with the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff agenda, which is impacting their operations and threatening their survival. Many are finding it difficult to set prices that absorb the cost of new duties on imports without deterring customers, leading to increased prices or reduced labor costs. Shayai Lucero, owner of Earth and Sky Floral Designs, reported a sharp increase in flower prices due to tariffs, forcing her to raise prices and consider the future of her business. Mike Roach, co-owner of Paloma Clothing, faces tariffs as high as 145% on goods from China, making them "unsaleable" and posing a significant threat to the store's future. </p>

          <p>British police are questioning four Iranian nationals in connection with an alleged terror plot targeting a specific location in the UK, while a fifth man has been released on bail. Arrests were made in multiple locations including Swindon, London, Stockport, Rochdale, and Manchester, with officers searching various addresses in these areas. Commander Dominic Murphy of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command emphasized the complexity of the investigation, stating that authorities are exploring various lines of inquiry to determine potential motivations and any further risk to the public.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt burdens growing, cardholders should strategically consider various debt relief options instead of simply halting payments or filing for bankruptcy. Stopping payments can lead to penalties, wage garnishment, and lawsuits, while bankruptcy has long-lasting effects on credit scores. Viable alternatives include credit card debt forgiveness programs, debt management programs, debt consolidation loans, and balance transfer cards. Each option has unique pros and cons, and the right solution depends on individual circumstances; careful research and a proactive approach are crucial to regaining financial independence.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new plan for a "forceful entry to Gaza," involving the call-up of additional soldiers and the relocation of Palestinians to the south. This escalation comes after months of blockades and bombardments, with critics arguing it endangers hostages and won't fundamentally change the conflict's dynamic. Israeli officials stated the operation would start slowly, anticipating cease-fire negotiations, but would commence in earnest if a deal isn't reached soon. The plan aims to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and destroy its infrastructure, but concerns remain about the impact on Palestinian civilians and the remaining hostages.</p>

The second dinner offers access to Trump's inner circle based on holdings of the $TRUMP token, with the top 220 holders promised a dinner with Trump.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of the de minimis tariff exemption means that cheaper goods from China will become more expensive for U.S. consumers. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on the loophole to ship low-value parcels to the U.S. tax-free, will likely raise prices. With the end of the exemption, many goods from China and other countries will no longer be as low-priced as they once were. Experts note that importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection now face a new administrative challenge: the burden of inspecting millions of additional packages daily, which could mean substantial delays in shipments.</p>

The plan includes preventing Hamas from distributing humanitarian aid and more powerful strikes against Hamas targets. </p>

UK filmmakers worry about potential job losses for freelancers if US productions are pulled, while unions fear the tariffs could devastate the recovering industry.

NASA advises viewers to go outside around 2 a.m. local time, find an area away from lights, and lie on their backs with their feet facing east. While optimal conditions can yield about 50 meteors per hour, light from the waxing moon may reduce visibility to 10-15 meteors per hour. The Eta Aquariids are known for their speed and originate from space debris shed by Halley's comet.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a case brought by Sudan accusing the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of fueling genocide by supporting paramilitary forces in Sudan's civil war, stating it "manifestly lacks jurisdiction." The court did not rule on the allegations but declined to issue provisional emergency measures against the UAE. The decision was based on the UAE's opt-out of a key clause in the Genocide Convention that allows countries to sue each other at the ICJ. The UAE rejected the claims, stating Sudan failed to present credible evidence.</p>

The Supreme Court overturned a lower court's acquittal of Lee on charges of violating election law and ordered the appeals court to issue a sentence. If the appeals court rules against Lee before the election, he may be forced out of the race, potentially swaying moderate voters.
