            <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter, citing uncertainty stemming from new U.S. trade restrictions. While CEO Christophe Fouquet maintains a strong demand outlook, particularly driven by artificial intelligence, he acknowledged that customer uncertainty could push the company towards the lower end of its 2025 revenue guidance. The company estimates 2025 revenue between 30 billion and 35 billion euros. Analysts suggest the impacts from U.S. tariffs could be widespread, but it is currently too early to determine the full effect. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Conservationists are raising concerns that the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to a surge in intense grass fires. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures have contributed to the fires, which have already burned 110 square miles of land. Endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles are particularly at risk, with some habitats completely destroyed. Conservation charities are calling for increased funding for peat bog restoration and better monitoring of controlled burns to protect vulnerable species.</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new trade envoy, replacing Wang Shouwen, as trade tensions with the US escalate. The move comes as China criticizes the US's "tariff barriers and trade bullying" for impacting the global economy. While both countries express openness to negotiation, no concrete steps have been taken. Analysts suggest the change in envoy could signal a need for fresh approaches to break the impasse, although others see it as a routine promotion during a tense period.</p>

Experts predict inflation to fall near the 2% target by 2026, but caution that Trump's trade wars may impact exports, investment, and consumer spending in the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Experts warn that customers could end up paying for data centers' energy costs in the absence of reform. Special contracts between utilities and data center companies may shift costs onto consumers, while excessive energy infrastructure development could lead to overbuilt systems. In the UK, zonal pricing could benefit data centers with flexible operations, but may increase wholesale prices for other consumers. Regulation and energy grid reform are crucial to managing energy prices and meeting changing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog has issued a cease and desist order to Google for unfair trade practices regarding search services on Android devices. The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. The JFTC said Google also used licenses to require manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices, with at least six such agreements in effect with Android makers as of December 2024.</p>
