            <p>Alibaba Group Holding's Damo Academy has received a "breakthrough device" designation from the FDA for its AI-powered cancer detection tool, Damo Panda. This designation allows for an expedited review and approval process, potentially accelerating the tool's deployment in healthcare. Damo Panda, designed to identify pancreatic cancer, has shown higher sensitivity than radiologists in detecting early-stage malignancies. The tool has already been deployed in trials across China, screening thousands of people and identifying early-stage cases.</p>

Edwards has the genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have. She says she found it impossible to "knowingly" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible. The decision raises ethical questions about designer babies, but Edwards says she is doing it for the right reasons.</p>
