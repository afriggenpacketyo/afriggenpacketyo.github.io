          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced a policy shift allowing federal authorities to pursue reporters' records and testimony in leak investigations, reversing a Biden administration policy aimed at protecting journalistic freedom. The Justice Department memo justified the change by citing the need to protect classified and sensitive information, which is a broader scope than the criminal code's focus on classified information.

          <p>The federal government is reversing course and restoring the records of international students whose entries in a crucial database were abruptly terminated. ICE had begun suddenly terminating thousands of students' SEVIS records in recent weeks, in many cases over what lawyers say were minor disciplinary records. The government will adopt a formal policy for revoking records in the database. The announcement follows dozens of judges issuing temporary orders directing the government to restore students' records.</p>

          <p>CBS's "60 Minutes" faces a crisis with the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, citing corporate interference. This comes amid President Trump's lawsuit against CBS over an interview with Kamala Harris and Paramount Global's merger with Skydance Media. The staff fears the company will settle the lawsuit to appease Trump, potentially undermining the program's independence. The situation raises concerns about the show's ability to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he will not reduce tariffs on China unless they offer something "substantial" in return. He specified that he wants China to open its markets to U.S. businesses and products, indicating that he seeks greater access for American companies to operate and sell their goods in China. These comments underscore the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the conditions Trump has set for any potential resolution.</p>
