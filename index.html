        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, pleaded not guilty in New York federal court. The Justice Department intends to seek the death penalty, arguing the murder was ideologically motivated by Mangione's anger towards the health insurance industry. Prosecutors claim the killing involved substantial planning and premeditation, intended to amplify an ideological message and provoke resistance to the industry. Mangione faces charges including murder through use of a firearm and stalking, stemming from the incident outside a Manhattan hotel. (not investment advice)</p>

Judge Richard J. Sullivan raised the scenario of the White House withdrawing protections for judges during a closed-door session of the Judicial Conference.

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a legal victory restricting compounding pharmacies from marketing cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies, upholding the FDA's determination that shortages of semaglutide are resolved. The decision allows the FDA to pursue pharmacies making compounded versions, addressing concerns about patient safety and unapproved drugs. Novo Nordisk has filed over 100 lawsuits against compounding pharmacies to protect against health risks from illegitimate drugs.</p>

          <p>Despite signals from Donald Trump about a potential trade agreement with China, China denies active negotiations and believes it holds the upper hand. China perceives its goods as more essential than America's money, and America's allies show little interest in joining the trade war. Furthermore, the trade war is politically more damaging for the GOP than the Chinese Communist Party, suggesting China faces less domestic pressure to concede. The article argues that China's control of rare earth minerals and its ability to redirect exports give it a strategic advantage.</p>

          <p>As student loan collections resume, the U.S. government has broad powers to garnish payments from defaulted borrowers. This includes seizing federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security benefits, potentially intercepting state income tax refunds and lottery winnings. Social Security recipients may have up to 15% of their monthly benefits reduced, but must be left with at least $750 per month. To avoid garnishment, borrowers are advised to contact the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options such as income-driven repayment plans or loan rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expediting permit approvals for mining, drilling, and fossil fuel projects on public land, reducing the review process to 28 days. This move, justified by a national energy emergency declaration, aims to expand oil and gas production. Environmental advocates criticize the expedited procedures for stripping away environmental review and public input.
