          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that Donald Trump's tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts while making deep spending reductions, faces criticism from Republicans like Elon Musk. The CBO analysis also found the bill would leave millions more Americans without health insurance by 2034. White House officials and Mike Johnson dismissed the projections, claiming the CBO is partisan and that the legislation represents unprecedented spending cuts. The Senate is expected to consider modifying the legislation in the coming weeks. (not investment advice)</p>
