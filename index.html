          <h2>PayPal Reports Earnings Beat but Revenue Misses Expectations, Reaffirms Guidance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PayPal reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the first quarter but missed revenue estimates and reaffirmed its full-year guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainty. While sales increased slightly, the company emphasized prioritizing profitability over volume by rolling off lower-margin revenue streams. Venmo's revenue grew by 20% year-over-year, and PayPal saw strong debit card momentum. Despite these positive aspects, analysts remain cautious about the potential impact of tariffs and competitive pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is considering displaying tariff surcharges on its website for ultra-low-price items sold through its 'Haul' store, a move that has drawn criticism from the White House. The White House press secretary called the potential change a 'hostile and political act,' questioning why Amazon didn't implement such measures during a period of high inflation. Amazon clarified that the consideration is limited to the 'Haul' store and has not been implemented on any of its properties. This consideration comes as retailers navigate the impact of new tariffs, with some sellers already raising prices and reducing advertising spend.</p>

While the 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts will remain, the administration will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of other tariffs. Automakers will also be reimbursed for tariffs on foreign auto parts for a limited time. The administration touted the move as a means of encouraging carmakers to bring manufacturing to the U.S.</p>
