          <p>Luxury parka maker Canada Goose is receiving take-private bids, with offers valuing the company around $1.35 billion, as controlling shareholder Bain Capital explores an exit. Private equity firms and a Chinese consortium are among the interested parties. This development comes as Canada Goose grapples with slowing growth in key markets and scrutiny over its brand strategy, suggesting a private environment could facilitate a turnaround away from public market pressures. The potential sale marks the end of Bain's 12-year investment, which has exceeded typical private equity cycles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage document fraud. Cook and her attorney assert the action is illegal, lacking "for cause" justification under federal law, and plan to file a lawsuit. The Federal Reserve Act mandates 14-year terms for governors, with removal only "for cause," a legal standard rarely tested. This move follows months of Trump's public criticism against the Fed's interest rate policies and its chair, Jerome Powell, signaling a significant challenge to the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, have filed a lawsuit against Texas, seeking to overturn new redistricting maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The plaintiffs allege that the maps, which are expected to favor Republicans, dilute the electoral influence of Black voters and constitute unconstitutional gerrymandering. Despite Republican claims of adherence to the Voting Rights Act, Democrats and civil rights advocates argue the redrawing is racially motivated. This legal challenge highlights ongoing accusations of discrimination in Texas's redistricting history, aiming to ensure fair representation for minority communities.</p>

          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-viewed film ever, surpassing 236 million watches since its June release. The movie, produced by Sony Pictures Animation, follows a fictional K-pop girl group using music and combat to fight demons. Its success is attributed to strong word-of-mouth, viral social media content, eye-catching animation, and a catchy soundtrack featuring K-pop industry veterans. The film has also achieved significant musical milestones, with songs topping global charts and a sing-along version becoming Netflix's first number one at the US box office.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, influenced by China's industrial profits data and new U.S. tariffs on India. China's industrial profits saw a smaller decline of 1.5% in July, indicating a recovery trend. Meanwhile, additional 25% U.S. tariffs on India's exports, bringing total duties to 50%, took effect. Japan's Nikkei was marginally higher, boosted by Nikon, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight movements. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw modest gains, with some analysts noting growing optimism in the latter.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative narratives, profiling locals and highlighting record visitor numbers in 2024. This initiative unfolds while National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing cleanup duties in public parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, others handle logistics and community projects like litter removal, creating unusual optics for the capital. The city aims to build on tourism momentum, especially with America's 250th anniversary in 2026, despite projected drops in international visitation.</p>

          <p>India's merchandise exports to the U.S., valued at $86.51 billion annually, are now subject to a steep 50% tariff imposed by President Trump, effective Wednesday. This additional 25% levy, triggered by India's Russian oil purchases, risks severely undermining India's attractiveness as a manufacturing hub and could reduce its GDP growth by 0.6 to 1 percentage point. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems, jewelry, textiles, apparels, and pharmaceuticals are highly exposed to these tariffs, potentially eroding India's export competitiveness compared to regional rivals. The move challenges India's economic outlook and trade diversification efforts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer prices and enhancing corporate margins. While state-backed firms experienced a 7.5% profit drop in the first seven months, businesses with foreign investments saw profits rise by 1.8%. The manufacturing and utilities sectors recorded profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry's bottom line.
