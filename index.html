          <p>Federal and New York City authorities have launched an investigation into the collision of a Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauhtémoc, with the Brooklyn Bridge. The incident occurred as the ship was departing the South Street Seaport, resulting in the deaths of two Veracruz cadets and injuries to at least 19 others. Senator Schumer has raised concerns about whether Department of Government Efficiency cuts may have contributed to the accident, specifically questioning the functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service. Officials are restricting access to Pier 36, where the ship is docked, while the investigation proceeds and repairs are assessed.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has commenced extensive ground operations throughout Gaza, issuing evacuation orders for several areas anticipating imminent attacks. As part of Operation Gideon's Chariot, the Israeli Defense Forces have launched strikes on sites, including a hospital in northern Gaza, with the stated goals of freeing hostages and defeating Hamas. Hamas reports that at least 67 people have been killed and 361 injured in Gaza in the last 24 hours. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are continuing ceasefire talks in Qatar, but a senior Hamas source claims no progress has been made due to Israeli intransigence, while Netanyahu's office states Israel is exhausting every possibility for a deal.</p>

          <p>Above the Law, a legal industry website, has gained popularity for its critical coverage of elite law firms accommodating President Trump. The site, known for its snarky coverage of legal news and bonus scoops, is now fueled by leaks from lawyers within these firms. Above the Law delivers a daily public shaming to what it calls “The Yellow-Bellied Nine,” the elite firms that pledged a collective $1 billion in free legal work to Mr. Trump. The website has also broken stories ahead of larger competitors.</p>
