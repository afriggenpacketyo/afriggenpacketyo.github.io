          <p>Orsted, a Danish renewable energy company, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to overturn a stop-work order on the Revolution Wind farm off New England.  The order, issued on national security grounds, halted construction of the 80% complete project, which would power over 350,000 homes. Orsted argues the justification is a pretext for the President's known opposition to wind power, citing his past statements and actions against the industry.  The lawsuit highlights the significant environmental reviews and investments already made in the project.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock price dropped significantly following a disappointing revenue forecast in its latest earnings report.  While second-quarter revenue exceeded expectations, the third-quarter guidance fell short of analyst predictions.  Concerns about the impact of AI on the SaaS market and challenges in selling certain products contributed to the decline.  CEO Marc Benioff maintained an optimistic outlook, downplaying concerns about the AI threat.</p>
