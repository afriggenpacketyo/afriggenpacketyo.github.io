          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been increasing its maneuvers around Taiwan, evolving from occasional sorties before 2020 into a coordinated campaign for combat training and strategic signalling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each differing in scale and purpose. Near-daily patrols have sharply increased since 2024, following William Lai Ching-te assuming office as Taiwanese leader. These patrols are intended to signal China's resolve and exert pressure on Taiwan. The increasing frequency and intensity of these operations highlight the escalating tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>Kensington Palace marked Prince William's 43rd birthday by posting a photo of him with the family's Cocker spaniel, Orla, and her puppies. The photo, taken by the Princess of Wales in Windsor, was signed "with love" by Catherine, their children, and "the puppies". The Royal Family's official account also shared a message and photo of Prince William visiting farmers on the Duchy of Cornwall. Orla was gifted to the couple by Catherine's brother in 2020 after the death of their previous dog, Lupo, and recently gave birth to four puppies. The image portrays a relaxed and informal moment for the Prince amidst recent formal occasions. The photo of Prince William with his puppies exudes a peaceful and comforting tone. </p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged downturn, worsened by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed at under 5 million units per year, a quarter of the 2017 peak. China's population has been declining for the past three years, with a projected fall to below 1.39 billion by 2035. This demographic shift is expected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s, despite Beijing's pronatalist policies. Stagnant incomes, job instability, and a poor social security system discourage young people from having more children. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, after experiencing an export ban from China in 2010 following a territorial dispute. Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% through stockpiling, recycling, investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas, and promoting alternative technologies. Western officials see Japan's approach as a template for other nations, but recognize the difficulty in escaping China's dominance. Despite progress, Japan still relies on China for heavy rare earth elements, highlighting the ongoing challenge of diversifying supply chains. The Japanese model demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigating supply chain risks.</p>

          <p>Two Self-Defense Forces (SDF) planes departed Japan for Djibouti to prepare for a potential evacuation of Japanese nationals from the Middle East. This action comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, heightened by recent attacks and suggestions of military options from the U.S. President. Eighty-seven Japanese nationals and their families were recently evacuated from Iran and Israel via government-arranged buses. Japan has raised its travel alert for Iran to the highest level, advising nationals to evacuate, while most of Israel remains under a Level 3 advisory, urging avoidance of all travel. The deployment of SDF planes underscores Japan's concern for its citizens' safety in the volatile region.</p>

          <p>A Scottish schoolgirl's message in a bottle, sent in 1994, was discovered in Norway over three decades later. Alaina Beresford, then 12, sent the message as part of a school project, and it was found by a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island. The volunteer, Pia Brodtmann, sent a postcard to Alaina, who was stunned to receive it at the same address after so many years. Alaina's handwritten letter, sent in an empty fizzy drink bottle, requested information about the finder and their location. This discovery highlights the enduring nature of human connection and the surprises that can emerge across time and distance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article critiques the current trend of online criticism targeting female celebrities, arguing that it often devolves into puritanical tellings-off rather than meaningful feminist analysis. Recent controversies involving celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae are cited as examples of this phenomenon. The author contrasts these modern critiques with the more nuanced and economically aware discussions of the past, particularly the "sex wars" of the 1970s. The piece suggests that these modern critiques are often ignorant of history and driven by sexist algorithms that reward extreme views, ultimately restricting women into smaller and smaller boxes.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has appealed to the House of Lords not to block the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill was backed by MPs but faces opposition in the Lords, where some fear it could lead to coercion of vulnerable people. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasized that the Lords' role is to scrutinize, not oppose, the will of the elected chamber. The proposed legislation includes safeguards such as multiple declarations, independent doctor assessments, and a multi-disciplinary panel review to prevent abuse.</p>

          <p>The House of Commons has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change.

The government anticipates a "commencement period" before any assisted deaths occur, estimating hundreds will seek this option initially, potentially rising to 4,000 annually after a decade. This decision reflects a socially liberal shift in Parliament, although the vote was closely contested. The future of the bill now rests with the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>A heatwave in the UK is intensifying, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C and a yellow thunderstorm warning issued for parts of England and Wales. The Met Office warns of potential localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in effect until Monday, indicating likely pressures on health and social care services. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to be cautious. The heatwave, while record-breaking for 2025, remains below the June peak of 1976, though climate change is generally making heatwaves hotter and longer.</p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. Guben, for example, offers a "trial living" scheme, allowing people to stay for up to four weeks free of charge. The initiative aims to reverse demographic changes caused by declining birth rates and emigration of young people. Despite an image problem with right-wing extremism, Guben has seen some success in attracting new residents. The effort highlights the need for innovative solutions to address demographic challenges in eastern Germany.</p>

          <p>Israel's Defense Minister stated that the military killed a veteran commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' overseas arm in Iran's Qom province. The commander, Saeed Izadi, led the Palestine Corps of the Quds Force. The Israeli military later reported killing a second commander, Benham Shariyari, in Tehran, claiming he was responsible for weapons transfers to proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. There has been no confirmation from the IRGC regarding the killings. The Israeli military believes Izadi financed and armed Hamas during the October 7 attacks.

          <p>The head of China's United Front Work Department warned religious groups to guard against "hidden dangers" and resist foreign infiltration. This warning follows similar calls from senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, to promote the "Sinicisation of religion". Top security official Chen Wenqing also called for the defeat of "separatism" during a visit to Qinghai province. These warnings come weeks before the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, indicating heightened sensitivity around religious matters.

The Times warns that the bill faces an "uphill battle" to become law, in the face of opposition from the House of Lords. The Daily Telegraph describes the RAF Brize Norton incident as an "act of sabotage" - and says the government is right to respond by proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist group.</p>

          <p>Chinese coast guard ships were spotted near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea for the 215th consecutive day, matching the longest streak since Japan put the islets under state control in 2012. The uninhabited islets, claimed by China and called Diaoyu, have long been a source of friction. The Japan Coast Guard confirmed that four Chinese ships equipped with autocannons sailed in the contiguous zone and warned them not to approach Japanese territorial waters. The previous 215-day streak ended in July 2024, likely due to a typhoon. The ongoing presence of Chinese ships near the Senkakus underscores the continued tensions between Japan and China.</p>

It highlights the shift in Israeli public opinion, with a majority supporting the decision to attack Iran. It suggests that the conflict serves as a vindication for Netanyahu, allowing him to rewrite his legacy and distract from past failures. The article questions whether the war will truly bring about victory or lead to devastating consequences for both nations. The author suggests that the bombing raids over Iran will not be enough for Netanyahu's vindication.</p>
