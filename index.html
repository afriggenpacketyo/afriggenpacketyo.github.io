          <p>President Donald Trump stated that Apple will face a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, specifically calling out India. This announcement led to a drop in Apple's stock in premarket trading. The company has been gradually shifting production to India, which has friendlier trade relations with the U.S. Some analysts estimate that manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. could increase the price significantly. Trump has been pressuring Apple and Tim Cook to increase domestic manufacturing and previously met with Cook at the White House.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. According to a study, nearly half of Japanese workers aged 20 to 59 admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, with those in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. This shift reflects a rejection of the intense work ethic of previous generations, who often sacrificed personal lives for their companies. Experts suggest this change is driven by a desire for more 'me time' and a recognition that companies no longer offer the same job security and benefits as before.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined as President Trump recommended a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading investors to seek safety in bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 8 basis points to 4.988%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 10 basis points to 4.457%. These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, influenced by concerns about Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit and Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.</p>

The bill proposes cutting billions from Medicaid and SNAP to offset new programs and extend tax cuts for the wealthy. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would cut $698 billion from Medicaid and $267 billion from food assistance, while adding $3.8 trillion to the national debt.

The National Education Union (NEU) is also likely to dispute the government if it doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers, stating they exceed inflation. The BMA argues doctors' pay remains significantly lower than it was 16 years ago when adjusted for inflation, potentially leading to renewed strike action.</p>

          <p>Actor Jussie Smollett has agreed to pay $50,000 to a Chicago charity, settling a lawsuit filed by the city over accusations that he lied about a hate crime. The payment will be made to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts, an organization supporting underprivileged youth in Chicago. In 2019, Smollett claimed to be the victim of a racist and homophobic attack, but he was later charged with lying to police. The charges were dropped, but Smollett has always maintained that it was not a hoax.</p>

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNBC that meeting President Donald Trump's demand for NATO members to spend 5% of their GDP on defense would be challenging. Mitsotakis suggested that 3.5% of GDP is a more realistic ceiling for hard defense spending, though the 5% target could be attainable in the long term if broader security-related expenses are included. Many NATO countries have historically struggled to meet the current 2% target. NATO estimates suggest the U.S. spent around 3.4% of its GDP on defense in 2024.</p>

The city, known for its modest size and typical German town features, has gamely played along with the jokes but now sees itself in a different light amid Germany's social and economic challenges. Bielefeld boasts a diverse economy built on family-owned companies and a successful soccer team, contributing to a newfound sense of pride among its residents.</p>
