          <p>China has launched a five-year action plan focused on metrology to drive innovation in chip technology and quantum-scale measurement, aiming to address shortcomings in its measurement capabilities. The plan, released by the State Administration for Market Regulation, prioritizes breakthroughs in over 50 core technologies by 2030. Metrological applications related to chips and rare earth magnets have become key points in the US-China tech rivalry, with the US tightening chip export controls and China leveraging its rare earth metals dominance. The expansion of metrological capabilities is a strategic priority for both countries, given its foundational role in industries dependent on precise measurements. Optimism surrounding China's technological advancement is tempered by the ongoing competition with the US.</p>

          <p>A passenger train derailed in the Bryansk region of western Russia, near the Ukrainian border, after a bridge collapsed, resulting in at least seven deaths. Hours later, a freight train derailed in the nearby Kursk region when a bridge beneath it also collapsed. Russian authorities are investigating the incidents as potential acts of terrorism, though details remain limited and unverified. Ukraine's military intelligence claimed responsibility for blowing up a Russian military freight train in the same region, but did not mention the bridge collapses. The situation highlights escalating tensions and potential sabotage targeting Russia's railway infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Stricter Voting Laws No Longer Benefit Republicans, Analysis Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 05:55:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent shift in American elections suggests that stricter voting laws no longer provide the advantage they once did to Republicans. Historically, lower voter turnout benefited the Republican party, as their affluent electorate had the resources to vote even when it was inconvenient. However, this dynamic has changed, potentially due to increased mobilization efforts among other demographics. This challenges the long-held axiom that Republicans should pray for rain on election day to dampen turnout and secure an edge, signaling a need for the party to re-evaluate its electoral strategies.</p>

          <p>At least 26 Palestinians were killed and 175 wounded while attempting to receive food aid in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials and witnesses. Witnesses claim Israeli forces opened fire on crowds near an aid site run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, while the IDF denies causing injuries within the distribution site. The foundation dismissed reports of chaos and gunfire, asserting it delivered aid without incident, despite previous accounts of violence at their sites. The UN and major aid groups have refused to work with the GHF, citing violations of humanitarian principles due to Israeli control over aid distribution, amidst ongoing challenges in delivering aid to Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a 16-year-old transgender athlete, won two gold medals and a silver at the California high school track and field championship, sparking controversy and protests. Competing under a new rule allowing an extra student to medal in events where Hernandez qualified, she shared first place in the high jump and triple jump. During the qualifying events, a plane flew over the stadium with a banner reading "No boys in girls' sports," highlighting the ongoing debate over transgender inclusion in sports. The California Interscholastic Federation launched a "pilot entry process" to expand competition when trans athletes participate, ensuring that a "biological female" student also receives a medal.</p>

The level of satisfaction depends on the respondent's living situation and the family policies in their country.
