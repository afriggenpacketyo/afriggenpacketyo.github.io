        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein is reportedly facing difficulties with its planned initial public offering (IPO), having shifted its focus to a Hong Kong listing after failing to secure approval from Chinese regulators for a London IPO. The company has been under scrutiny regarding allegations of forced labor and breaches of consumer protection laws, including concerns about fake discounts and misleading sustainability claims. The closure of the U.S.'s de minimis loophole for low-cost goods further complicates Shein's situation, as criticism intensifies and Chinese regulators hesitate to approve the IPO amidst these challenges. The article suggests these issues make Hong Kong a more viable, though perhaps less prestigious, option for Shein's public offering.</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, who led the New York Police Department during the 9/11 attacks and later faced imprisonment for tax fraud, has died at the age of 69 after battling an illness. Kerik was appointed police commissioner by Rudy Giuliani in 2000 and was hailed as a hero after 9/11 before his career took a downturn due to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2010. He served three years in prison before being pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020 and remained a controversial figure, working on efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss. Despite his later legal troubles, Kerik was remembered by some as a courageous public servant who helped rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational corporations, driven by the potential for cost savings. These deals often involve a 'newco structure,' combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend allows Chinese biotech companies to license their intellectual property as an alternative to selling shares amid depressed valuations. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing deals, reflecting the broader trend of increasing deal numbers and values in this sector.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. This decision follows technical talks between the two nations and is expected to involve a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities. While some restrictions remain on food imports from certain Japanese prefectures, this move signals progress in resolving tensions between the two countries. Japanese fishermen and businesses have welcomed the announcement as a significant milestone, with the expectation that shipments will begin after the completion of the registration process and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the U.S. approach to crypto regulation, particularly as the Trump administration aims to foster a more industry-friendly environment, including Binance's deepening ties with World Liberty Financial and expansion in Pakistan.</p>

The decision came after a judge stepped down due to criticism over her participation in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor argued that the judge had violated judicial ethics by allowing a camera crew to film closed-door hearings, leading to a national scandal and the judge's resignation. The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death in November 2020.</p>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. government deported Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who had contributed significantly to American aerospace and weaponry. Despite his pivotal role in developing America's first guided ballistic missiles, he was deported due to McCarthy-era xenophobia, a decision later deemed a critical mistake. Upon returning to China, Qian persuaded Mao Zedong to initiate a modern weapons program, leading to China's first missile test by the end of the decade and transforming China into a superpower. The deportation serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of targeting foreign students and researchers, as it altered the global balance of power and spurred China's technological revolution.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist, Lian Ping, warns that financial sanctions and countermeasures could become a new battleground in the escalating rivalry between China and the United States. While the likelihood of full-scale financial sanctions remains low, Washington could gradually expand sanctions to push China out of the U.S. dollar system. Lian cautions that sanctioning China within the SWIFT system would significantly damage the system itself, potentially leading countries to shift to China's alternative payment system, CIPS, thereby undermining SWIFT's importance. This reflects growing concerns about the potential for economic conflict amidst rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has launched an attack on conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a 'bad person' who 'probably hates America.' This criticism comes after a panel of judges, including a Trump appointee, ruled against Trump's tariffs, putting him at odds with some conservative legal circles. Trump expressed disappointment in the Federalist Society, suggesting it was influenced by Leo and gave him bad advice on judicial nominations. This marks a notable shift, as Leo previously advised Trump on Supreme Court picks and was a key figure in the conservative legal movement.</p>

The Trump administration argues that a ruling against the president would undermine his ability to negotiate trade deals, while critics say he is abusing his power.
