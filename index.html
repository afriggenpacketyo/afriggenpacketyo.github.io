          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has voiced his disapproval of the Irish rap group Kneecap performing at Glastonbury Festival, citing a pending court case against a member, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, on terror-related charges for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch also expressed concerns about the BBC broadcasting the performance, given the charges against Ó hAnnaidh. Kneecap responded to the Prime Minister's comments with an expletive-laden accusation of arming a genocide, referring to the conflict in Gaza. The BBC has stated that while they don't ban artists, their programming will adhere to editorial guidelines. The controversy has raised questions about freedom of expression and the role of public broadcasters. Despite the controversy, the band will still perform at the festival. </p>

          <p>The second week of the Israel-Iran war has begun with increased strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a warning from Iran against U.S. intervention, as smoke rises near Isfahan following Israeli attacks on centrifuge production sites. Israel reports killing three senior Iranian commanders, including one involved in arming Hamas, while Iran launched a new wave of drones and missiles at Israel, resulting in minor injuries to several U.S. citizens. The U.S. State Department has begun assisting evacuations of Americans from Tel Aviv to Athens, and President Trump is considering military intervention, potentially using B-2 stealth bombers based in Guam, while Iran warns against U.S. involvement. Simultaneously, Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza continues, with reports of escalating casualties and ongoing strikes.

This act aligns with a global movement to return indigenous remains taken abroad, with Australia having repatriated over 1,785 sets of remains from overseas collections in the past 30 years.

          <p>The presence of a senior Taiwanese officer at a U.S. military exercise in Alaska has garnered significant attention, signaling potential closer defense cooperation between Taiwan and the United States. Major General Wu Chia-hsing, head of the air force’s flight training division, participated as an observer in Red Flag Alaska 25-2, a major air combat drill involving several regional allies. Analysts suggest this move indicates U.S. commitment to its security obligations in the region, despite President Trump’s transactional approach. The exercise involved 1,500 personnel and 70 aircraft from various countries. </p>

          <p>The Republican National Committee (RNC) holds a substantial financial advantage over the Democratic National Committee (DNC), with nearly five times more cash on hand. The RNC reported $72 million on hand at the end of May, compared to the DNC's $15 million, marking the widest disparity between the two parties since at least July 2020. This financial edge could provide Republicans with an early boost as they prepare for next year's midterm elections. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party. The DNC, however, highlights a surge in grassroots support and individual donations.

This offer comes as Mexico seeks to enhance its energy security and reduce its reliance on natural gas imports from the United States. Mexico currently meets 72% of its natural gas demand through imports, primarily from the U.S. This development could potentially diversify Mexico's energy sources. </p>

Jack Reed of Rhode Island criticized President Donald Trump's rebuke of his own intelligence chief, suggesting that Trump is disavowing the intelligence community for political reasons. This criticism follows National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard's testimony that the intelligence community assesses that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Trump has publicly stated that Gabbard and the intelligence community are wrong. Reed believes that Trump's stance may be influenced by his contemplation of an attack against Iran.

The release came as US special envoy Keith Kellogg visited Minsk and met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovskaya expressed joy at her husband's release but emphasized that over 1,150 political prisoners remain behind bars.
