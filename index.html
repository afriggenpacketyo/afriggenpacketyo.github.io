          <p>During cross-examination in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, Cassie Ventura admitted to jealousy over Combs' other relationships. The defense questioned her previous testimony, including an alleged incident where Combs dangled a friend over a balcony, which Ventura stood by, while the defense claimed she learned about it later. Ventura testified that Combs could be explosive due to his alleged drug use, while the defense attempted to highlight Combs' concerns about Ventura's drug use. The cross-examination was described as disjointed at times.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates have finalized an agreement to establish a 10-mile artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi, making the UAE a rising power in AI. President Trump visited the site, which will be supplied by American-made AI chips and is expected to be the largest project of its kind outside the United States. The project is part of the "U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership," and will help American AI companies serve customers within a 2,000-mile radius of the campus. Concerns have been raised regarding protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China, given the UAE's authoritarian government and ties to China.</p>

          <p>Cava, the Mediterranean fast-casual chain, reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, demonstrating double-digit same-store sales growth of 10.8%. This performance contrasts with a broader slowdown in the restaurant industry, where companies like Chipotle and Sweetgreen have reported declines. Cava's CFO noted an increase in premium attachment and positive traffic across various demographics, indicating diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual dining. Despite its strong quarterly performance, Cava reiterated its same-store sales forecast of a 6% to 8% increase for the year.</p>

Royce emphasized the importance of maintaining the essence of each song, keeping recognizable elements like choruses and titles in English.

The law aligns with the positions of Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Florida's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, who believe fluoride affects children’s intellectual abilities. Public health experts argue that the measure will increase tooth decay and cavities, especially in children, while DeSantis claims it protects against forced medication, stating that people can choose to use fluoride in toothpaste and mouthwash.</p>

JPMorgan, Ondo, and Chainlink announced a $100 billion bet on blockchain at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, signaling further growth in the Canadian crypto sector.

          <p>Legislation winding its way through the House does not include President Trump's suggestion to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, disappointing many seniors. The exclusion is due to rules prohibiting changes to Social Security through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and Medicare, potentially depleting the Social Security trust fund in 2032.</p>

          <p>The question of what children should read has been a recurring theme throughout history, with debates ranging from the appropriateness of fairy tales to the role of classics. Some argue that children's books should impart moral lessons, while others believe that children should have the freedom to read whatever they want, without strict limitations. Concerns have been raised about the decline in children's reading for fun and the potential impact of analytical approaches to reading in schools. A balance between critical reading and organic enjoyment may be necessary to foster a love of books in children.</p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a mega-bill known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" to enact President Trump’s agenda, including significant tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy, increased military and immigration enforcement spending, and cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key areas of disagreement within the party include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and Medicaid changes. The bill would make major changes to Medicaid, including work requirements and reduced funding, while also curtailing clean energy tax credits. It also proposes changes to food stamps and education spending, while increasing the national debt limit.</p>

The company will absorb some costs, but shoppers are likely to see price increases toward the end of May and more in June, affecting items like bananas, avocados, coffee, roses, toys, and electronics. Walmart is also taking steps to reduce tariff exposure by shifting to alternative materials and sources.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and raise the cap to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028, but the plan has limitations.

While the credit starts to phase out for high-income earners, middle-income families currently see the biggest benefit. The House bill is taking the child tax credit away from 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, focusing on whether a single district court judge has the power to block a policy across the country. The justices did not directly consider the legality of Trump's order, which seeks to deny citizenship to babies born to undocumented migrants. Some justices expressed skepticism about the legality of the order, with Justice Sotomayor stating it violated four Supreme Court precedents.

          <p>Coinbase reported that cybercriminals bribed overseas support agents to steal customer data for social engineering attacks, potentially costing the company up to $400 million. The hackers are demanding a $20 million ransom, which Coinbase has refused to pay, instead offering a $20 million reward for information leading to their arrest. While passwords and private keys were not compromised, sensitive data such as names, addresses, and government ID images were exposed. Coinbase has terminated the employees involved and is cooperating with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The FBI issued a warning about "malicious actors" using artificial intelligence-generated voice memos to impersonate senior U.S. officials. These scammers are targeting current and former government officials and their contacts, sending text messages and AI-generated voice messages to establish rapport before gaining access to personal accounts. The scammers use malicious links to gain access to the accounts and steal information, which could then be used to target other officials or solicit funds. The FBI is urging recipients of such messages to verify their authenticity.</p>
