          <p>South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to increase their share of the global shipbuilding market as the United States applies pressure on China's industry. South Korea's new presidential administration has pledged significant support for its shipbuilding sector, which it describes as being in a major crisis. The new government's policies aim to foster the development of advanced vessels, including autonomous and eco-friendly ships, through enhanced training, digitalization, and automation. This strategic push is intended to re-establish the nation as a world-leading maritime power.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's star rookie, Caitlin Clark, will miss her fifth consecutive game due to a persistent groin injury, the team announced. This marks her ninth missed regular-season game this year, a significant number for a player who had no prior history of missing games in her college or professional career. Coach Stephanie White indicated that Clark participated in some non-contact drills but has not yet returned to full practice speed. Despite her absence, the Fever have maintained a winning record, securing victories in four of their last five contests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Connecticut law permitting towing companies to sell towed vehicles after only 15 days is facing criticism for being predatory and disproportionately affecting working-class residents. Opponents argue that private operators are targeting neighborhoods where people may struggle to afford the high fees required to retrieve their cars in such a short timeframe. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of systematically towing hundreds of cars from apartment complexes. The company's owner defends the practice, stating he is simply enforcing the parking rules of the private properties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed his signature "One Big Beautiful Bill" into law, enacting a package that makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent while cutting spending on federal safety-net programs. The legislation also allocates major funding increases for border security and national defense. While the administration touts the bill as a victory for the economy and various American groups, Democrats have sharply criticized it. Opponents warn the law will add an estimated $3 trillion to the national debt and could cause millions to lose health insurance coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Clarifies Trump's New Bill Does Not Eliminate Social Security Taxes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new "big, beautiful bill" eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, a closer look reveals this is not entirely accurate. The legislation does not directly change how benefits are taxed but instead introduces a new, temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors over 65, which applies to all their income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not help the lowest-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. The measure could also add financial pressure to the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records who are being held at a naval base in Djibouti. The court's ruling lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked their removal to a third country, in this case South Sudan, without a chance to contest the deportation. The administration argued the lower court's order was lawless and created dangerous conditions for personnel guarding the detainees. Dissenting justices expressed grave concerns that the migrants could face torture or death upon their removal to South Sudan.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing backlash from artisans in Kolhapur, India, for releasing a line of footwear that strongly resembles the traditional Kolhapuri sandals without acknowledging their origin. The incident has sparked a debate on cultural appropriation, with local artisans and industry groups demanding recognition and a share of the profits. For generations, these leather sandals have been handcrafted by a specific community for modest prices, and the controversy highlights the struggle of traditional craftspeople against global fashion giants. Prada has since acknowledged the sandals' roots and is reportedly in talks with an Indian trade association.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in the spring, growing fat before migrating deep into the Antarctic Ocean for the winter. By burning this fat far below the surface, they sequester an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars. This discovery forces a significant reassessment of the Southern Ocean's capacity for carbon storage.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed what appears to be a criminal gang systematically defrauding the estates of deceased individuals in the UK by using forged wills. The fraudsters identify unclaimed estates from a public government list, then produce a fake will naming one of their members as the sole heir, effectively stealing the inheritance from legitimate relatives. The report highlights significant weaknesses in the digital probate system, which relies on trust and has failed to detect suspicious claims, also enabling tax fraud. Several cases show similar patterns, yet authorities have been slow to act.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to protest the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids and the newly passed budget bill that funds them. The protest moved from City Hall to the federal building, with marchers chanting against deportations and what they term an "occupation" by federal agents. The event follows weeks of heightened tensions in Southern California due to aggressive ICE enforcement actions and the deployment of the National Guard. Local leaders have condemned the raids, stating they are causing widespread fear in the community.</p>

          <p>Germany started its Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The influential defender, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears during the first half. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller in the second half secured the three points for the eight-time champions. While the performance improved, the team was wasteful with chances, and the loss of their captain casts a significant shadow over their tournament prospects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new executive order from the Trump administration will implement significant changes at America's national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international visitors. The order also mandates that any revenue from these increased fees be used for park infrastructure improvements and gives U.S. residents preferential treatment in lotteries or permit systems. In a separate move, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system. This aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart attacks shares five "toxic" foods he no longer feeds his children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon because of nitrates and sodium. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. Instead, he recommends whole-food alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and air-fried vegetables. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns reflects on the American Revolution, describing it as a bloody civil war born from deep division, not unlike the political turmoil of today. He argues that the nation is held together by the ideas in its founding documents, like the Declaration of Independence, and that understanding the founders' flaws makes their achievements more accessible and powerful. Burns champions a complex, inclusive view of history that tells stories from the "top down" and "bottom up," rejecting sanitized narratives. He stresses that a citizen's duty is lifelong learning.</p>
