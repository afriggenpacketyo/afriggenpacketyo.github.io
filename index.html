          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Advisor to President Trump, has been indicted on 18 criminal counts in Maryland for allegedly mishandling classified information. The indictment claims he shared over a thousand pages of top-secret diary entries with two relatives via non-governmental email and stored classified documents at his home. Bolton's lawyer denies wrongdoing, asserting the records were unclassified and known to the FBI since 2021. This article notes Bolton is the third prominent Trump critic indicted recently, raising questions about political motivations behind these charges.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in nuclear fusion research, with private and state-backed companies aiming to build a commercial reactor by 2035 or sooner. Engineers at ENN Group's EXL-50U tokamak facility are actively working to achieve plasma temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius, a crucial step for sustained fusion. The ultimate goal is to fuse light hydrogen atoms into heavier ones, releasing vast amounts of clean electricity by replicating the energy process of the sun. This article highlights China's ambitious timeline and commitment in the global race for sustainable energy solutions.</p>

          <p>The fourth episode of 'The Celebrity Traitors' saw TV sports presenter Clare Balding banished as a faithful, much to the frustration of the remaining contestants. A challenge involving asking banshees to sing led to humorous subtitle moments, with Celia Imrie and Charlotte Church's vocalizations drawing particular attention. Sir Stephen Fry's plunge into a well also provided a rare moment of presenter Claudia Winkleman's mask slipping. The article highlights the ongoing inability of the celebrities to identify the traitors, maintaining the show's dramatic tension and comedic elements.</p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring hybrid meat alternatives, combining plant proteins with cultivated animal cells, fungi, or insects to create more sustainable and palatable options. Research from Tufts University and UMass Amherst suggests these hybrids could improve taste, nutrition, and environmental footprint compared to traditional meat. However, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association strongly opposes these innovations, arguing that consumers prefer real American beef over 'ultra-processed' lab-grown products. This article highlights the ongoing debate between traditional agriculture and emerging food technologies, focusing on both the scientific promise and industry resistance.</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, an unusual public disclosure for such sensitive matters. This authorization, known as a presidential finding, could grant the agency broad powers, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or actions aimed at destabilizing the Maduro regime. Historically, similar findings have led to various interventions, from funding insurgencies to regime change efforts in other nations. Experts caution about the US's past track record in Latin America, noting the potential for a 'slippery slope' without explicit congressional approval or oversight.</p>

          <p>Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in has been delayed for over three weeks, with House Speaker Mike Johnson citing the ongoing government shutdown. However, critics accuse Johnson of intentionally delaying her seating because her signature would trigger a vote to release files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, had pledged to sign the bipartisan petition, making her the decisive 218th vote needed.

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new $100,000 annual fee for H-1B worker visas. The Chamber argues the fee is unlawful, overriding existing immigration law which bases fees on processing costs, not revenue generation. This policy is seen as making it prohibitively expensive for businesses, particularly startups and small-to-midsize companies, to hire skilled foreign workers in fields like technology and engineering.
