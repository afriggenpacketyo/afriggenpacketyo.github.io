          <p>President Trump signed a $3.3 trillion legislative package, celebrating it as a major victory that fulfills key second-term promises. The bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, introduces new tax deductions for tips and overtime, and rescinds some green energy credits from the Biden era. It also allocates substantial funding for defense and a mass deportation initiative while instituting new work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients. The measure passed the Senate by a narrow 51-50 margin, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, overcoming opposition from Democrats and some Republican senators.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 18:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions between India and China are increasingly playing out within multilateral organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), where both nations are vying for leadership of the Global South. The consensus-based decision-making rules of groups such as the SCO and BRICS often highlight the geopolitical friction between the two powers. A recent meeting of SCO defense ministers failed to produce a joint statement due to a lack of consensus on language regarding terrorism, a point of contention pushed by India. This reflects a broader strategic competition as India seeks to counterbalance China's growing influence within these key alliances.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Proscribe Direct Action Group Palestine Action as Terrorist Organization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 17:59:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The direct action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after the High Court and Court of Appeal rejected its last-minute legal challenges. The proscription means that supporting the group, including membership or expressing public support, will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision followed actions claimed by the group that caused an estimated £7 million in damage to aircraft at an RAF base. Palestine Action's lawyers argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group that does not advocate for violence.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary pause on the removal of eight migrants detained at a U.S. military facility in Djibouti, just hours before they were scheduled to be deported to South Sudan. This legal maneuver occurred shortly after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for their deportation. The migrants, who were convicted of violent crimes in the U.S., have no ties to South Sudan, and their lawyers argue they could face torture or harm there. The judge's stay was intended to allow the case to be transferred back to the original judge in Massachusetts who first blocked the removal, citing due process concerns.</p>

Despite a strong performance that saw her serve for the first set and lead in the second, the sustained pressure from Sabalenka proved too much.

          <p>Congress has passed a massive tax and spending package, which was subsequently signed into law. The legislation makes permanent many of the 2017 Trump tax cuts and increases spending on border security and defense. It is funded in part by significant changes to social safety net programs, including new work requirements for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add trillions to the federal deficit and result in millions losing health coverage, a forecast that Republicans dispute.

He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options.

While the dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency provides a buffer, experts like Ray Dalio warn that the U.S. is approaching an inflection point where its debt could become unmanageable without significant and potentially painful fiscal adjustments.

          <p>A new tax and spending bill introduces changes affecting how Social Security benefits are taxed, though it falls short of eliminating the tax entirely as some had claimed. The legislation creates a new temporary "bonus" deduction for seniors, which could lower the federal income tax burden for many, but it does not alter the fundamental taxability of the benefits themselves. According to a White House analysis, this change means nearly 90% of beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income tax on their benefits. However, policy experts note the largest benefits will go to higher-income seniors, while low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. (not investment advice)</p>

The law implements major tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy, while imposing new restrictions on social safety-net programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which could leave millions without benefits. It also allocates a monumental $170 million to immigration enforcement to support the administration's mass deportation efforts. Democrats have criticized the bill as a transfer of wealth to the rich at the expense of vulnerable Americans and immigrant communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing backlash after using the word 'shylocks' during a speech in Iowa while discussing changes to the estate tax. The term, which originates from a Jewish character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice,' is widely considered an offensive and antisemitic trope related to greed. When questioned by reporters, the president claimed he was unaware of the word's antisemitic connotations and understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the term 'very troubling and irresponsible,' and he was also criticized by Democratic Representative Dan Goldman.</p>

Norrie mentioned using a crowd-engagement tactic similar to Andy Murray's, drawing energy from specific fans to motivate himself during the match. After a turbulent period that saw his ranking drop, Norrie stated he is enjoying his tennis more than ever and will now face Chile's Nicolas Jarry in the last 16, marking his second career appearance at this stage of the tournament.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history, primarily because it introduced the novel concept of a 'citizen' rather than a 'subject.' He emphasized that this shift turned the world upside down and set in motion two centuries of global movements toward self-governance. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, also reflected on the importance of telling America's complicated stories, including the flaws of its founders. He argued that embracing this complexity makes history richer and more accessible for everyone, reinforcing the nation's founding ideals.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding in Texas Hill Country has led to a significant disaster, with authorities reporting at least six to thirteen fatalities and around 20 children from a summer camp missing.

During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 people to watch the event on July 4th. He mentioned that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the proposed fight. If it were to happen, it would be the first time a major sporting event of this kind has been hosted at the White House.</p>

Such tariffs would affect a wide range of popular European products, from Irish butter to Italian olive oil. While the EU stated that progress was made toward an agreement, it also affirmed its readiness to implement retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods if the Trump administration proceeds with the new duties.

Activist groups report that politicians, particularly from the ruling coalition, increasingly use terms like 'deviant' and 'perverse' to demonize the community. This demonization is compounded by censorship, such as the blocking of a prominent LGBTQ+ news portal, creating a dangerous atmosphere that activists say overshadows other critical issues like poverty and healthcare access.</p>

In response, President Bukele posted photos and videos on social media platform X, arguing that Abrego Garcia appeared well and that the claims were false.
