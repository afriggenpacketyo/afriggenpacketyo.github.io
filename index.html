          <p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a stern warning to Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, suggesting he could face a similar fate to Saddam Hussein if Iran continues its aggression against Israel. Katz emphasized the consequences of committing war crimes and firing missiles at Israeli citizens. He also claimed that Iran's "replacement chief of staff" was killed in recent Israeli strikes on Iranian soil, escalating tensions between the two nations. This statement underscores the heightened state of alert and potential for further conflict in the region, as Israel signals its resolve to defend its citizens and interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated his goal is a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, demanding Tehran cease all enrichment activities, not just a ceasefire with Israel. He dismissed French President Macron's assertion that he left the G7 summit to work on a ceasefire, stating the issue was "much bigger than that." Trump hinted at Israel intensifying its assault on Iran, particularly targeting its military command and nuclear program. He also addressed potential threats to U.S. interests, warning Iran against targeting U.S. forces, while indicating a willingness to send envoys to negotiate if the situation allows.</p>

          <p>Despite claims from the Trump Organization that its newly announced T1 smartphone will be "built in the United States," experts suggest it will likely be manufactured in China. Analysts point to the lack of domestic manufacturing capabilities and the common practice of using Chinese original device manufacturers (ODMs) for smartphone production. The phone, which will run Google's Android operating system and retail for $499, has raised questions about the feasibility of completely manufacturing smartphones from scratch in the U.S. Experts also note that establishing large-scale manufacturing in the U.S. would take several years.</p>

Although ADCs have made significant progress, some experts believe it will take years before they can fully replace chemotherapy. Challenges remain, including ensuring the toxic payload is released at the right time and identifying the correct cancer-causing proteins to target. </p>

The move follows pressure from the FDA and Department of Health and Human Services for the food industry to reduce artificial dyes.

          <p>Despite promises of a large-scale deportation program, President Trump's administration has not deported as many people as President Obama's administration did. Obama's strategy involved increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records. Trump's efforts to replicate this strategy have been hampered by decreased border crossings and increased opposition to cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Trump has attempted other tactics, such as workplace raids, but has yet to match Obama's deportation numbers, and now expresses hesitancy about deporting farm and hotel workers.</p>

          <p>Apple's deep entanglement with China has transformed the country into a manufacturing powerhouse, according to a new book. The company's collaboration with Foxconn and other Chinese manufacturers led to advanced manufacturing capabilities and economic growth in China. Apple's investments and training programs in China have been instrumental in developing the country's industrial base. However, this close relationship has also raised concerns about national security and the geopolitical balance of power.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit in Canada earlier than planned, citing the escalating situation in the Middle East as the reason. This decision led to the cancellation of scheduled bilateral meetings with the Ukrainian and Mexican presidents, as well as a press conference. Trump had previously issued a warning on social media, advising everyone to evacuate Tehran. He stated that he needed to return to the White House due to "very important" issues, without providing specific details.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its government bond-buying reduction beyond next year while maintaining interest rates, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy due to trade and economic uncertainties.

The BOJ will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026, and the benchmark policy rate remains unchanged at 0.5 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexican supermarket chains in Southern California, such as Vallarta and Northgate Gonzalez Markets, are standing up for immigrant communities amidst ICE raids. These businesses, owned and operated by immigrant families, are providing support and resources to customers affected by the raids. The stores are offering a safe space and continuing to operate at full hours to provide a sense of normalcy. They are also offering free or discounted food delivery and fundraising for local organizations.</p>
