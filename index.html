          <p>Abraham Shafi, founder of the IRL social media app, has been federally charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, and obstruction for allegedly defrauding investors of $170 million. The Department of Justice claims Shafi spent millions on incentive advertising to boost app installs, misleading investors about user acquisition costs, and then concealed these expenses. He is also accused of diverting significant investor funds for luxury personal expenses, including his wedding. Shafi, whose app was once valued at $1 billion before shutting down, faces up to 20 years in prison per count, underscoring the severe consequences of corporate malfeasance.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares experienced a significant 24% surge after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that substantially exceeded Wall Street expectations, despite a general sales decline. The company refined its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous range and increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed sales challenges to economic pressures on consumers but highlighted strategic efforts like reintroducing popular product categories and overhauling discount policies. This market response indicates investor optimism regarding Kohl's ongoing turnaround initiatives to reclaim customer loyalty and improve financial performance.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent attempt to rebrand with a new logo sparked significant consumer backlash, including public criticism from President Donald Trump, causing a temporary dip in market value. The company swiftly reversed its decision, reinstating its original logo featuring "Uncle Herschel," acknowledging the importance of customer feedback. This incident highlights a broader trend of companies retreating from branding changes that alienate their base, especially in the era of rapid social media response.

          <p>A certificate of deposit (CD) account can be a valuable option for savers seeking to protect their principal and avoid stock market volatility, despite generally lower returns than market investments. A $40,000 CD can earn between $423.24 for a 3-month term at 4.30% and $9,018.09 for a 5-year term at 4.15%, depending on the term and interest rate. While locking money away incurs early withdrawal penalties, the fixed interest rate offers predictability. Savers are encouraged to consider their budget, goals, and ability to commit funds for the full term, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon, to determine if a CD is the right move.

          <p>This article explores the complex debate among liberals regarding President Trump's challenge to the Federal Reserve's independence, specifically his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook. While many see Trump's actions as undermining democratic institutions, some progressives argue that the Fed's independence is itself anti-democratic, as its decisions significantly impact the economy. The article posits that an operationally independent Fed, insulated from immediate political pressures, is better positioned to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, ultimately serving the long-term public interest. It concludes that Trump's attempt to remove a governor on a pretext is procedurally anti-democratic and subverts established legal frameworks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's militarization of the Washington D.C. police, exemplified by deploying combat-equipped soldiers, represents an initial step towards a "prerogative state" where executive power is unchecked. The author contends that Trump's justification of "crime fighting" is a pretense, with actual crime rates being low. The deployment serves to intimidate and reinforce a law-and-order image for his base, while potentially creating the very unrest it purports to quell. The article warns that such actions, even with a "thin patina of legality," erode democratic norms and could escalate to unprecedented uses of military power in domestic affairs, posing a significant threat.</p>

          <p>The NFL has relaxed certain restrictions on Tom Brady as he transitions into his second year as a Fox analyst, following the league's approval of his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. A key change allows Brady to attend production meetings with coaches and players remotely, a previous prohibition. While he is still barred from team facilities for these meetings, he can conduct interviews off-site. The league continues to enforce a rule against "egregiously criticizing officials," which Brady successfully navigated in his initial year, reflecting his evolving dual roles in sports media and team management.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Washington D.C. were unsuccessful in obtaining a felony indictment against Sean Dunn, a former Justice Department employee, who admitted to throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol officer. Despite video evidence showing Dunn yelling expletives and anti-fascist sentiments before throwing the "submarine-style sandwich," a federal grand jury declined to issue an indictment for assaulting federal law enforcement. Dunn was subsequently fired after his arrest for the August 13 incident. Prosecutors may still opt to pursue misdemeanor charges, which would not necessitate a grand jury decision, highlighting a procedural hurdle in the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to protecting Social Security from any potential cost-cutting measures, even as congressional Republicans consider a reconciliation bill. Trump pledged to safeguard beneficiaries of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, despite projections that the Social Security trust fund could be depleted by 2033. He also promoted a temporary tax deduction for seniors from the recently passed "One Big, Beautiful Bill Act," though economists debate its effectiveness for low-income individuals and its impact on the program's long-term solvency. The Social Security Administration is also pursuing a "digital-first agency" initiative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) and its Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding potentially discriminatory employment practices. The Department of Justice will determine if CalEPA's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which include applying a "racial equity lens" to workforce development, violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This move aligns with President Trump's broader stance against DEI initiatives and represents an escalation in the ongoing clashes between his administration and California over environmental regulations and social policies, setting the stage for a legal battle.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper has withdrawn from the US Open ahead of his second-round match due to an arm injury, specifically a bruised humerus in his left serving arm. Despite winning his initial match, the discomfort became too severe for the British number one, who had been struggling with the issue since April. This withdrawal, following disrupted preparations and missed tournaments, is a significant setback for Draper. It will likely impact his world ranking, potentially causing him to drop out of the top 10, and hinder his chances of qualifying for the season-ending ATP Finals.</p>

Moldova's government faces internal challenges from economic difficulties and pro-Moscow candidates, alongside external threats of election interference and disinformation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the maximum Social Security payments available to seniors in 2025, emphasizing that the benefit amount is highly dependent on the age of retirement. A person retiring at full retirement age could receive up to $4,018 monthly, while delaying until age 70 could increase the maximum to $5,108 per month, totaling over $61,000 annually. Attaining this peak benefit demands a consistent history of high earnings, meeting or exceeding the taxable maximum for at least 35 years, and strategically delaying benefit claims. The article suggests that most retirees will need supplementary income streams, such as reverse mortgages or annuities, for a secure retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, the plaintiffs assert that the Online Safety Act conflicts with U.S. constitutional free speech protections.
