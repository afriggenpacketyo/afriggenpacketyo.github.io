          <p>This article reflects on the five years since George Floyd's murder and the subsequent Black Lives Matter movement. While the movement sparked global protests and discussions about racial justice, progress has been limited, particularly in the US, where Trump administration policies have rolled back diversity and inclusion initiatives. Despite this, some positive changes include increased awareness of racism and bans on the knee-to-neck maneuver in some states. The article concludes with a sense of resilience, noting that Black communities have a long history of survival in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on extending the arms embargo on South Sudan, a nation grappling with persistent conflict that has displaced millions and caused widespread malnourishment. Amnesty International warns that lifting the embargo could worsen the human rights situation, citing reports of Ugandan troop deployments in South Sudan as a violation. While the UN insists on its efforts to stop the conflict, some citizens question the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations in the region, where violence continues despite the UN's presence.</p>

          <p>This article explores the origins of the seven-day week, tracing it back to the biblical command of six days of work followed by a day of rest. It contrasts historical views of work as a necessity with the modern obsession with busyness, arguing that neither extreme is ideal. The article cites research showing a productivity ceiling of 55 hours per week, suggesting that a balance between work and rest, as advocated in the Bible, is essential for both well-being and optimal output.</p>
