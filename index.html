A waitlist is open, promising a share in $1 million in $TRUMP rewards for early sign-ups and referrals, marking the latest attempt to drive inflows into Trump-affiliated crypto ventures.

Musk expressed his disappointment with the measure, which aims to advance Trump's domestic priorities, stating that it undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded by noting that President Trump is aware of Musk's stance on the bill, adding that it does not alter the president's opinion.

          <p>With forecasts predicting above-normal temperatures this summer, Americans are likely to increase their air conditioning use, leading to higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are expected to reach a 12-year high, averaging $784 for the summer, disproportionately impacting lower-income households. Experts recommend using fans, ensuring AC filters are clean, and setting AC temperatures between 70Â°F and 78Â°F. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, and unplugging small appliances when not in use, and many utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help manage energy costs (not investment advice).</p>

Documents obtained by CBS News reveal a proposed timeline for the name change, prompting criticism from figures like Nancy Pelosi, who condemned the decision as a vindictive erasure of those who fought for equality.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. The proposal would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a challenging timeframe given existing backlogs. Even if met, asylum-seekers would need to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of six months. Advocates are concerned this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and push them into the underground economy, while the administration aims to eliminate what it views as a magnet for migrants exploiting the asylum system.</p>

Graham expects the Senate to begin moving his Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, which would impose "bone-breaking sanctions" on Vladimir Putin and a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian oil. Trump's growing frustration with Putin, particularly the bombardment of Ukrainian cities, has seemingly emboldened Graham to advocate for these sanctions. The White House may allow Republicans to "vote their conscience" on the bill, but Trump's final approval is still needed for it to advance.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, have been charged with smuggling a fungus, Fusarium graminearum, classified as a potential agroterrorism weapon, into the U.S. Authorities allege that Jian and Liu were receiving Chinese government funding for their research, some of which was conducted at the University of Michigan. Liu admitted to smuggling the fungus into the U.S. through Detroit Metropolitan Airport to conduct research at the University of Michigan laboratory where Jian worked. The FBI says the fungus causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year.</p>

          <p>Citigroup (Citi) announced it is rolling back its 2018 policy that placed restrictions on providing banking services to retail clients selling firearms, citing recent regulatory developments. This decision comes amid scrutiny from lawmakers over allegations of banks denying services to certain industries or political groups since the Trump administration took office. Citi stated it will update its employee code of conduct and customer-facing global financial access policy to clearly state it does not discriminate based on political affiliation. The move follows Republican-led states pushing legislation to discourage perceived discrimination by banks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed the House, is being criticized as an attempt to roll back Obamacare. The bill could cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage and make it harder to sign up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Republicans argue that the bill aims to reduce "waste, fraud, and abuse" in Medicaid, while Democrats frame it as an assault on Americans' health care. The legislation would also make several ACA changes, including shortening the open enrollment period and ending policies that allowed low-income people to sign up year-round (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A series of deadly incidents have occurred near an aid distribution site in Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by the US and Israel. Thirty-one Palestinians were reportedly killed by Israeli fire on Sunday, followed by three people on Monday, and another 27 on Tuesday, according to health officials. Israel has denied firing on civilians, stating that warning shots were fired on Sunday and that soldiers opened fire after identifying "several suspects" on Monday and Tuesday. The GHF site, named Safe Distribution Site 1 (SDS 1), is part of a new aid system aiming to bypass the UN, which Israel accuses of failing to prevent Hamas from diverting aid.</p>

          <p>German customs cleared more than four times as many items in 2024 compared to the previous year, largely due to e-commerce, with 90% of online deliveries originating from China. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil noted that more cheap goods and counterfeit products are entering Germany from China, leading to discussions about abolishing the existing tariff limit of â‚¬150. The European Commission has proposed adding a flat fee of up to â‚¬2 on packages to address the surge in small deliveries from China. In addition to online deliveries, customs also seized 161 weapons of war and increased amounts of marijuana, though officials have not linked the marijuana increase to Germany's partial legalization of the drug.</p>

Home Office figures show a significant rise in red days, defined as days likely to see small boat crossings due to favorable weather conditions. Critics argue that the government is using the weather as a scapegoat for the high crossing numbers, while others point to factors such as the effectiveness of smuggling gangs and the number of people wanting to reach the UK. The government maintains it is working to fix the asylum system and has prevented 9,000 crossings from the French coastline this year.</p>
