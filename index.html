          <p>A federal judge has temporarily ruled against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president overstepped his authority. The order mandates the return of control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stated that the courts have the authority to review a president's decision on the necessity of the National Guard, distinguishing it from a monarchy. California officials argued that local law enforcement was managing protests effectively, and the military deployment escalated tensions, therefore the judge sided with the state of California. The optimism score is based on the tone of the article which is more stable than panic.</p>

          <p>Israel conducted military strikes against Iran early Friday morning, prompting Israel's defense minister to declare a "special situation" in the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed Israel's unilateral action and emphasized that the U.S. was not involved but focused on protecting American forces in the region. President Trump had recently announced the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East while reiterating that the United States would not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons. Videos circulating on social media depicted explosions in eastern Tehran and other areas, with reports of jets and anti-aircraft missiles heard in northern Tehran, adding to the tension and uncertainty of the situation. The optimism score is relatively low due to the potential for escalation and broader conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. This discovery challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, which is part of what is now called the Middle East. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The optimism score is relatively high due to the positive nature of historical discovery and academic advancement.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the pioneering U.K. proto-industrial band Nitzer Ebb, has died at the age of 58, with the band confirming the news on social media. McCarthy founded Nitzer Ebb, known for its harsh and antagonistic electronic body music, in Essex, releasing their first single in 1985. The band's 1987 debut LP, "That Total Age," played a formative role in the industrial wave, influencing acts like Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. McCarthy faced health issues late in life, citing liver cirrhosis in 2024, and his passing marks a significant loss to the electronic music community. The optimism score is low due to the sad news of the artist's passing.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs inside cancer cells, halting the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments. This advanced form of chemotherapy hits cancer with a bigger dose while reducing side effects. Paul Silvester, one of the first patients, describes the therapy as "life-changing," allowing him to spend more time with family and plan future adventures. Clinical trials showed the therapy halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with current therapies, marking a significant advancement in myeloma treatment. The optimism score is high due to the promising nature of the new cancer therapy and its positive impact on patients' lives.</p>

          <p>Caravan buyers report being misled, overcharged, and even threatened by holiday parks, according to a BBC investigation. Buyers claim they were given misleading information about potential rental income, faced steep and unexpected increases in site fees, and felt pressured to sell caravans back to parks at a loss. One couple reported receiving a threatening phone call after seeking legal advice. Industry insiders describe the sector as largely unregulated, leaving buyers vulnerable to unfair contract terms and practices. The optimism score is low, reflecting the negative experiences of caravan buyers and the lack of regulation in the industry.</p>
