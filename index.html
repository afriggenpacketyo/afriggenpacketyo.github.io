            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has delayed a planned vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint, which aims to fund President Trump's agenda, due to internal disagreements within the Republican caucus. Despite efforts from Johnson and Trump to persuade GOP holdouts, concerns remain about deficit reduction measures within the plan. The delay comes as Senate leaders emphasize the importance of passing the blueprint to advance Trump's agenda. The House narrowly passed a procedural rule to advance the legislation, highlighting the challenges Johnson faces in unifying his party around the budget.</p>

            <p>California Assemblymember Carl DeMaio (R-San Diego) announced a campaign to qualify a voter ID and proof of citizenship proposal as a statewide ballot initiative for the 2026 election after his bill was rejected by lawmakers. The bill, AB 25, would have required voters to provide documentation of citizenship when registering and photo ID before voting in person. DeMaio argues that the initiative is a nonpartisan issue aimed at restoring public trust in elections, citing polls showing widespread support for voter ID requirements. Opponents argue that such requirements would disenfranchise eligible voters and promote false claims of election insecurity.</p>

            <p>The stock market experienced a significant rally after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on "reciprocal tariffs" for most countries, reducing the rate to 10% effective immediately. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all saw substantial gains, marking one of the best days in stock market history. However, China is an exception, as Trump increased tariffs on goods imported from that nation to 125%. Despite the positive market reaction, experts caution that uncertainty remains due to the potential for tariffs to resume and the impact of penalties on China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Meta (Facebook) executive, testified before a Senate panel, alleging that the company collaborated with the Chinese government to censor its platforms. Wynn-Williams claimed that Meta provided custom censorship tools to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), allowed user data access by the CCP, and removed accounts of Chinese dissidents. She also alleged that Meta's AI model, "Llama," was used to assist DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company. Meta has denied these claims, stating that it does not operate its services in China today. The hearing highlights growing concerns in Washington regarding China's influence on American technology companies.</p>
