        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Insurance has launched a formal investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires, prompted by concerns about inconsistent claims management and inadequate communication. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara highlighted troubling patterns, including frequent adjuster reassignments and inconsistent handling of similar claims. State Farm says it is cooperating with the investigation and believes a fair review will show customer satisfaction. The investigation comes after the approval of a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers, with the potential outcome of requiring State Farm to pay out previously denied claims and compensate for delayed payments.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating conflict, Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned Tehran residents to evacuate following Iranian missile strikes that killed civilians in Israel. Iran launched approximately 100 missiles, vowing further retaliation for Israeli attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure. The U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level and the U.S. is sending refueling aircraft to Europe to support defensive operations. President Trump stated that Iran is "basically at the negotiating table," while Israel claims its strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear program. </p>

          <p>The American Bar Association is suing the Trump administration, arguing that its push to punish law firms is unconstitutional, claiming the administration is coercing lawyers to abandon clients and causes the President dislikes. The lawsuit cites instances where law firms promised pro bono work to avoid government targeting, leading to a chilling effect on firms taking cases against the administration's agenda. The ABA claims it has struggled to find firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases, and asks a federal judge to declare Trump's orders unconstitutional. White House officials dismiss the lawsuit as frivolous.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in NIH research grants was unlawful, citing racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Judge William Young ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The cuts, led by Elon Musk, targeted research with connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion, marking a departure from science-based review processes. The ruling only applies to some grants, with further claims to be ruled on after additional evidence is presented.</p>

While the measure faces challenges in the GOP-controlled Congress, it highlights concerns about presidential war powers and the US role in the Middle East.

          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, addressing the Israel-Iran conflict and trade tensions with allies. He indicated that Iran would "like to talk" about de-escalating hostilities, while also maintaining his stance on tariffs. Trump signed a trade agreement with the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to cut tariffs on cars and aerospace, but tensions remained with other allies due to trade policies. He also mused about allowing China to join the group and commented on Vladimir Putin's ouster from the G8.</p>

          <p>President Trump vowed to ramp up deportations in Los Angeles and other Democratic cities, creating confusion after officials signaled a pause in arrests at farms, restaurants, and hotels. Trump's plan contrasts with a directive to halt arrests at certain worksites, even as immigration actions continued. The threat comes amid ongoing protests and deployments of military forces in Los Angeles, leading to clashes and concerns over federal overreach. Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump's policies, while Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the deportation plan as illegal and divisive.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has licensed the presidential family name for smartphones and cellular services, calling it "Trump Mobile." The cellular service has one plan titled "The 47 Plan" priced at $47.45. They are also releasing a "T1 Phone" later this summer, described as a "sleek, gold smartphone engineered for performance," and comes adorned with an American flag. The organization has specified that the $499 phone was not designed or made by Trump Mobile, but by another company entirely.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his goal to expand deportations in major U.S. cities, particularly those run by Democrats, directing ICE to focus on New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Trump accused Democrats of using illegal immigration to influence elections and grow the welfare state. These comments followed protests against the administration's immigration crackdown. Trump shifted his stance on undocumented immigrants working in the farming and hospitality industries, acknowledging their value as long-time workers.</p>
