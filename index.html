          <p>Oil prices surged following the U.S.'s entry into the conflict between Iran and Israel, sparking fears of supply disruptions. Experts warn that oil could reach $100 a barrel if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for global oil trade. The U.S. military's involvement has heightened market volatility, with analysts anticipating potential Iranian countermeasures, such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, which could lead to Western intervention and prolonged conflict. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz could cause a significant disruption to oil supplies, potentially leading to a price shock comparable to the 2022 Ukraine war crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following U.S. missile strikes in Iran, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) held calls with governors and law enforcement officials to discuss the heightened threat environment. While there is no specific, credible threat against the U.S. homeland, officials are urging vigilance for cyber activity and potential risks to Jewish institutions and groups associated with Israel. The Secure Community Network (SCN) reported a surge in violent posts directed at the Jewish community on social media after the U.S. strikes, and DHS officials noted that Tehran's retaliatory efforts would depend on the extent to which it believes U.S. actions threaten the regime's stability. The calls were intended to ensure states are aware of the current threat environment and encourage them to reach out to relevant state agencies and infrastructure partners.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially posted condolences on social media for the "tragic" U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, but later amended and deleted the post. The original post expressed sympathy for victims and families impacted by the bombings, but was removed after criticism. Stop Antisemitism, an organization combating incitement towards Jewish people, questioned whether the department's account had been hacked, stating there were no victims in the successful targeting of Iran's nuclear sites. The U.S. military conducted strikes targeting nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in Operation Midnight Hammer, with officials describing the mission as a success in degrading Tehran's ability to develop nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, facing human smuggling charges, can be released on bail, but he will likely be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) instead. Despite the judge's finding that the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, she acknowledged that he would likely remain in custody due to an ICE detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country. Prosecutors allege he conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S. between 2016 and 2025, while the defense claims the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials revealed details about Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff calling it the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history". The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with a separate group acting as decoys. The strikes, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success" that devastated the Iranian nuclear program without targeting Iranian troops or the Iranian people.</p>

          <p>A bank teller, Izabella Bogumil, identifies common mistakes Social Security recipients make, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning. Claiming benefits too early, at age 62, results in a significant reduction in monthly payments, often leading to financial struggles. Bogumil recommends waiting until age 70 to maximize benefits, highlighting the potential for increased payments by delaying retirement. Careful consideration of claiming age is crucial for maximizing Social Security benefits and ensuring financial security in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, with China last sending pandas to Japan in 2011.

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases to Avoid for Better Communication with Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, Reem Raouda, identifies five "toxic" phrases that hinder communication with children and offers alternative approaches for fostering cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "Stop crying" are discouraged, as they shut down communication and invalidate children's emotions. Instead, the expert suggests using phrases that acknowledge feelings, explain reasoning, and invite problem-solving. The goal is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by respecting the child's autonomy and providing emotional safety.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported for suspected cyberstalking offences, with experts linking this trend to the normalisation of digital surveillance. Charities emphasize the need to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age, as constant online monitoring is becoming normalised from a young age. Sharing locations and checking online activity are often seen as signs of love and care, but can also set precedents for concerning behaviours. The article highlights the challenges of addressing cyberstalking among children and the importance of teaching meaningful consent and clear boundaries.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for those meeting strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. The move aims to provide access to those most in need, but some GP practices warn that many patients will not immediately qualify. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making individuals feel fuller, but requires ongoing support and monitoring. NHS England plans to expand availability in phases over the next few years, with the health watchdog NICE evaluating the rollout.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. Iran controls the northern side of the strait, making it a strategic chokepoint. Interference with oil flows through the strait could disrupt international energy markets and economies, potentially driving up oil and gas prices.</p>
