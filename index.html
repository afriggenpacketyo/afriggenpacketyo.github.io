          <p>Sources indicate that the royal family of Qatar is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as Air Force One, potentially to be gifted shortly before he leaves office. The plane would undergo security checks for spying devices before acceptance. However, Qatar's Media Attach√© disputes reports of an immediate gift during Trump's visit, stating the matter is under review by legal departments. Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres has urged an investigation into the ethics of accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign government, citing potential violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian president has expressed readiness to meet with Russia's leader in Turkey, but insists on an immediate truce before negotiations commence, as reported by The New York Times. President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from the European leaders' cease-fire-first approach. Despite initial rebuffs from France and Germany, Zelensky has added a new twist, stating he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey. These exchanges follow Putin's rejection of a Monday cease-fire deadline and his counteroffer of direct talks in Istanbul, adding complexity to diplomatic efforts.</p>

Fortunately, no festival-goers were harmed, though the officer sustained minor injuries.

          <p>The UK government is considering tightening English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents as part of a broader overhaul of the immigration system. Migrants may also need to wait 10 years to apply for settlement instead of five, with a fast-track option for skilled workers in fields like nursing and AI. Critics warn the new rules may split families, while supporters argue they will encourage integration and reduce exploitation. These changes aim to create a more controlled, selective, and fair immigration system, addressing public concerns about net migration.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, to facilitate a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes before President Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to enable humanitarian aid entry. Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is among the remaining hostages in Gaza. Israel's prime minister's office stated the US informed them of Hamas' intention, expecting it to lead to further hostage negotiations, while maintaining their military objectives.</p>
