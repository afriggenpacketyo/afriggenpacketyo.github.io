          <p>The article discusses President Trump's intention to seek an expedited Supreme Court ruling to overturn a federal appeals court decision deeming most of his tariffs illegal, blaming the decision for a stock market decline. It suggests that while the market overall may not favor tariffs, U.S. Treasurys could benefit as investors demand higher returns due to fears of reduced government revenue. The article also touches on other news, including Google's antitrust case, Xi Jinping's comments on world peace, and Kraft Heinz's planned split. This article gives a snapshot of the overall financial market, and the impacts of tariffs. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Thailand's ruling Pheu Thai party is seeking royal approval to dissolve parliament and call for new elections after its prime minister was ousted and a rival party attempted to form a coalition government. The People's Party is supporting Anutin Charnvirakul for prime minister, contingent on dissolving the House of Representatives within four months, potentially leading to fresh elections. The People's Party leader expressed concerns about the return of the old coalition and the possibility of a coup maker becoming prime minister. The move reflects Thailand's ongoing political instability and the power struggles between different factions.</p>

          <p>England winger Lauren James has responded to criticism she received during Euro 2025, stating that fans were "too quick to judge" her performances. James revealed that she played through injury during the tournament, which affected her form, and also expressed her fear of racist abuse after missing a penalty. She emphasized that fans are often unaware of the challenges players face and should be mindful of their comments. Despite the criticism, James affirmed her commitment to representing England and her desire to continue playing for her country.</p>

          <p>Heavy rains and floods in the Indian state of Punjab have resulted in at least 30 deaths and affected over 354,000 people, with authorities declaring all 23 districts flood-hit. Approximately 20,000 people have been evacuated, and relief camps have been established to provide shelter and assistance to affected families. The Chief Minister described these as the worst floods since 1988, causing extensive crop damage on agricultural land. Disaster response teams, including the Indian army, airforce, and navy, are involved in rescue operations, and the weather agency attributes the floods to interactions between monsoon currents and weather systems.</p>

          <p>Sheffield Wednesday's potential takeover is in limbo due to the club's ongoing financial crisis and disagreements over valuation. Owner Dejphon Chansiri has rejected offers, holding out for a valuation considered unrealistic by experts, leading to fan protests and boycotts. The club faces an English Football League investigation into financial issues, potentially resulting in a points deduction. Despite interest from potential buyers like John Textor, Chansiri's motives remain unclear, and the club's future hangs in the balance as fans attempt to pressure him into selling.</p>

          <p>Fire crews quickly responded to a brush fire in the Hollywood Hills, successfully preventing it from impacting any structures. The fire, which ignited north of West Sunset Boulevard, burned about a quarter of an acre of vegetation and briefly threatened nearby homes. Water drops from Fire Department helicopters significantly slowed the fire's progress, and all active flames were extinguished within half an hour. The rapid response was praised by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, and the Fire Department remained on site to monitor hot spots. </p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring schools to alert families and teachers when immigration enforcement authorities are on campuses, responding to the Trump administration's deportation policies. The bill mandates that K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges notify students, faculty, and staff, similar to emergency warning systems. The legislation is intended to inform and empower school communities to make the best decisions about their safety, particularly in the face of mass deportations. The bill is now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature to become law.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' inconsistency persisted in a loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, highlighting the team's struggle to perform consistently and beat teams with losing records. Despite a comeback effort led by Shohei Ohtani's home run, the bullpen faltered, and the lineup couldn't overcome the deficit. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for increased intensity and acknowledged that players who don't step up their performance could see reduced playing time. The Dodgers are aiming to address their inconsistency as they approach the postseason.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing an early-stage branding supercycle as Chinese brands gain global recognition and trust. The Labubu craze, exemplified by Pop Mart's success, demonstrates that being from China is no longer synonymous with being cheap. This brand muscle is extending into industries such as batteries, cars, drones, and biotech, with Chinese companies competing on trust as much as on hardware. The rise of CATL batteries, featured in Xiaomi cars, further illustrates the shift from cost advantage to brand advantage in the Chinese business mindset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Keir Starmer, has challenged the government's plan to limit a civil service internship scheme to students from working-class backgrounds. Gray questioned the evidence base behind the decision, arguing that she learned from being around people from different walks of life. The government argued that the change will bring in more working-class young people, but Gray expressed concern about limiting exposure to a wider group. The move highlights ongoing debates about diversity and inclusion in the civil service.</p>
