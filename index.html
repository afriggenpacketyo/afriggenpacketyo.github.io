          <h2>Ferrari Warns of Tariff Risks Despite Profit Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna highlighted double-digit growth in key metrics, attributing it to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact the company's profitability this year, potentially reducing profitability percentage margins by 50 basis points, as the company would have to update its commercial policy. The automaker will continue to monitor the trade situation closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists and experts working on the sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA6) has raised concerns about the future of climate research in the United States and its global impact. The move follows earlier cuts to climate science bodies and the US Global Change Research Program, jeopardizing the publication of the NCA6 report. Experts fear the administration may attempt to inject biased science into the report, while international researchers worry about the loss of valuable data and collaboration with U.S. scientists.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to convert Alcatraz Island back into a federal prison has been met with disbelief and skepticism by tourists visiting the San Francisco attraction. Visitors questioned the practicality of the idea, citing the island's deteriorated condition and lack of essential infrastructure. The island was closed as a federal prison in 1963 because it was far more expensive to run a prison on an island than on the mainland. Local officials dismissed the proposal as unrealistic, emphasizing Alcatraz's current role as a popular tourist destination and historic landmark.</p>

          <p>The Constitution mandates "due process of law" for all non-citizens on U.S. soil, but the specifics of what that entails remain contested, especially concerning deportation proceedings. While the government must provide notice and an opportunity to be heard, the extent of procedural protections varies based on an immigrant's status and circumstances. Legal experts say the type of "notice" and "hearing" historically afforded depends on an immigrant's status and circumstance, such as whether they had been lawfully admitted to the country in the first place, have deep ties to the community, or are seeking asylum.</p>

          <p>Palantir's shares fell approximately 9% after the bell, even though the artificial intelligence software company boosted its revenue guidance and reported earnings that met expectations.

CEO Alex Karp attributed Palantir's government sector growth to greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools. Palantir is forecasting that U.S. commercial revenues will top $1.178 billion this year. (not investment advice)</p>
