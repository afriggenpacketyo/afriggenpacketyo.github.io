          <p>An Environmental Protection Agency proposal to roll back Biden-era greenhouse gas emission standards is projected to increase gasoline prices, according to the administration's own analysis. The report, citing U.S. Energy Information Administration data, contradicts the EPA's public claims of cost savings for consumers. The analysis indicates that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would heighten demand for gasoline, leading to higher prices for all drivers and an estimated loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. This internal data highlights a significant conflict between the administration's policy goals and their documented economic and environmental consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the president's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, stating the administration has "real concerns" about the reliability of federal jobs data. The dismissal followed a July jobs report that showed slower-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Greer argued that while revisions are normal, recent swings have been extreme, justifying the change in leadership. The move drew sharp criticism, including from McEntarfer's predecessor, who called the firing groundless and a dangerous precedent for the integrity of federal economic statistics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on most imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% and an effective rate of 17%, the highest in decades, Americans could face an average annual cost increase of over $2,000. Economists warn that goods like appliances, clothing, and cars will become more expensive as companies can no longer absorb the costs. The move could also lead to supply-chain delays and fewer product choices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The establishment, known for its classic Southern cuisine, was a major tourist destination and pivotal to Deen's rise as a Food Network star. The announcement came without warning, surprising fans and occurring just weeks after the restaurant posted hiring notices. This closure follows a pattern of abrupt shutdowns of other establishments linked to Deen, who has focused on her restaurant business since a 2013 controversy over her admitted use of a racial slur.</p>

However, a final-round 74, which included three bogeys and a double bogey on the back nine, caused him to drop into a tie for ninth. This finish placed him four strokes outside the necessary position to qualify for the prestigious junior tournament.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, demanding that its board overrule Chair Jerome Powell and immediately cut interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump called Powell a "stubborn MORON" after the Fed decided to hold rates steady for the fifth consecutive time. This break with the traditional presidential respect for the central bank's autonomy comes as the administration faces scrutiny over its tariff policies and a weakening jobs market. Trump's criticism aims to shift blame for any economic slowdown onto the Fed's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

This model proves that despite the availability of curative drugs for over a decade, access and efficiency are key barriers to widespread treatment.

Compounding the weak report, the Labor Department also issued sharp downward revisions for May and June, cutting a combined 258,000 jobs from previous estimates. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2%.

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop medical providers from offering gender-affirming care to minors. The suit argues the White House and Justice Department are using intimidation tactics, such as subpoenas and threats of criminal prosecution, to create a de facto national ban on such care. In response, several prominent children's hospitals have already closed their gender clinics. The administration contends it has the authority to stop treatments it describes as harmful, setting up a major legal battle over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>In a significant legal setback for Tesla, a Florida jury has found the company partially liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot software that resulted in one death and a severe injury. The plaintiffs argued that the driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes before the Model S sedan drove through an intersection and struck two pedestrians. The verdict means Tesla is responsible for paying up to $243 million in damages. Tesla maintained the driver was at fault for being distracted and vowed to appeal the verdict, which marks the first time a jury has ruled against the company in a fatal Autopilot case.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 19:05:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK Supreme Court ruling has narrowed the path for millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance, a decision one claimant called "a bitter pill to swallow." The court did not uphold a previous ruling that deemed hidden commissions paid to dealers as inherently unlawful. However, it did leave open the possibility for claims based on unfairly large commissions, meaning lenders still face a potential compensation bill estimated between £5 billion and £13 billion. The case centered on discretionary commission arrangements, where dealers were incentivized to sell loans with higher interest rates, a practice banned in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves to strengthen their roster before the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and versatile outfielder Alex Call. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity, expected to help fortify the bullpen. Call provides a right-handed bat and defensive flexibility in the outfield. Manager Dave Roberts expressed confidence that these additions raise the team's overall floor, but emphasized that the team's ultimate success depends on its existing star players performing more consistently through the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>At an internal meeting, social media giant ByteDance disclosed that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. The data was shared by CEO Liang Rubo to counter online speculation that the company had a very high turnover rate. These figures suggest that ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry. The company notably abandoned the demanding "996" work culture in 2021 in favor of a more standard five-day work week.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end their status was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus.

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, took a creative form of revenge after a Kia dealership repossessed her car just a month after purchase. Upon discovering that Taylor Kia of Lima had let its business name registration with the state lapse, she registered the name for herself and sent the dealership a cease-and-desist letter. The dealership initially tried to force the dispute into arbitration, but an appeals court has now ruled that the fight over the trade name is a separate matter that can proceed in court. The case highlights a unique consumer-versus-corporation battle stemming from a paperwork oversight.</p>

A return would make sense for Los Angeles, which is in need of experienced receiving depth following the recent retirement of Mike Williams.
