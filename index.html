        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. These changes are designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in real income. For 2026, married couples filing jointly will see a standard deduction of $32,200, while single filers will have a deduction of $16,100. The adjustments reflect a projected inflation rate of 2.7%, a smaller increase compared to the significant adjustments made in preceding years. (not investment advice)</p>

The indictment was pursued by a U.S. Attorney appointed by former President Donald Trump, who had publicly called for the prosecution of James and other political opponents. This development follows a similar indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.

          <p>In a recent interview, author D.J. Waldie, known for his evocative writing about Los Angeles, reflects on the city's complex identity and the necessity of loving it, imperfections and all. Waldie argues that a deeper understanding of the city's true history, beyond clichés and booster myths, is crucial for its residents to make better political and social decisions. He suggests that this "attunement" to the past allows people to reinhabit their communities and resist forces that seek to deconstruct the city. His work aims to foster an "affective history" that encourages readers to feel something for their home.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The denim company's gross margin expanded to 61.7%, and it has raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 3%. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand, and the company plans further increases next year. The growth in direct sales and expansion into non-denim categories like tops have also contributed significantly to the positive financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-based rare earth and critical mineral mining companies experienced a significant surge after China announced tighter restrictions on its exports of these materials. The new Chinese rules require a license for exporting products containing even small amounts of rare earths, a move seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will increase investment in domestic supply chains to reduce U.S. dependency on China. The move comes ahead of a potential meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai, the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate, is celebrated for his challenging yet profound work that explores the effects of political oppression. His novels, such as "The Melancholy of Resistance," are characterized by long, labyrinthine sentences and a mood of existential dread, yet they defy the acceptance of stultifying political conditions. The article suggests that while his style is experimental, his selection aligns with the Nobel committee's tradition of honoring writers who translate specific historical contexts into timeless, universal art. Krasznahorkai's work is described as both placeless and deeply relevant.</p>

The article outlines numerous challenges ahead, including Hamas's disarmament, managing a multinational stabilization force, and overseeing Gaza's reconstruction.

          <p>The new film adaptation of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," directed by Bill Condon, is praised as a "sexual and scatological dazzler." The movie musical stars Diego Luna as a political prisoner and Tonatiuh as his gay cellmate, who escapes their grim reality by recounting the plot of a musical starring a fictional actress played by Jennifer Lopez. The review highlights the film's clever use of musical fantasy sequences to contrast with the harsh prison drama, celebrating humanity and the need for joy even in oppression. Lopez's performance as the film-within-a-film's star is lauded, as is Tonatiuh's breakout performance.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the personal and cultural journey of learning English as a second language, moving from a forced requirement in Spain to a means of identity formation in the United States. The author discusses the nuances between different forms of English and the initial challenges of being lost in translation. Drawing on past articles from The Atlantic, the piece explores the cognitive and personal benefits of multilingualism, such as enhanced self-awareness. Ultimately, the author concludes that mastering a foreign language is an odyssey that creates new imagined selves, a profound experience that AI translation tools may render obsolete.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 15:25:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The ongoing federal government shutdown is jeopardizing a critical recovery effort for the endangered black-footed ferret, one of North America's rarest mammals. With U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists furloughed, the planned release of 400 captive-bred ferrets into the wild is now on hold. Wildlife experts warn that the fall is a crucial window for the animals to adapt and mate before winter. The delay threatens the fragile wild population of about 300 ferrets and creates a bottleneck at the breeding facility, potentially halting future breeding efforts and endangering the species' long-term survival.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to reconsider nominating him to lead NASA. Trump had previously nominated Isaacman for the position but withdrew the nomination after a public dispute with Elon Musk, a close associate of Isaacman's, and after labeling Isaacman a "blue blooded Democrat." Isaacman, a seasoned private astronaut and founder of Shift4, has deep ties to the space industry, particularly through his collaborations with SpaceX. The new discussions suggest a potential reconciliation and a renewed effort to fill the top job at the U.S. space agency.</p>

          <h2>Alex Jones Petitions Supreme Court to Pause $1.5 Billion Sandy Hook Defamation Judgment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene and temporarily halt the enforcement of a nearly $1.5 billion judgment against him. The judgment stems from defamation lawsuits filed by families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, whom Jones repeatedly and falsely claimed were "crisis actors." In his emergency request, Jones argues that he should not have to pay while his appeal is considered, claiming the case violated his free speech rights. He stated that without a stay, his company, InfoWars, would be destroyed before the legal process is complete.</p>
