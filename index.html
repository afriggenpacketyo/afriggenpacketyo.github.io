          <p>Gerwyn Price secured a win at night 12 of the Premier League Darts in Liverpool, defeating Luke Humphries in the final with a score of 6-4. The Welshman's victory propelled him to third place in the league standings, marking his third nightly win of the season. Luke Littler, despite an early lead, suffered a quarter-final loss to Michael van Gerwen, facing boos from the Liverpool crowd. Littler remains at the top of the table, still on track for the end-of-season play-offs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to expedite seabed mining, even in international waters, a move that disregards a widely ratified international treaty. The order directs NOAA to fast-track permits for companies interested in mining within both U.S. and international territories. This decision is likely to provoke criticism from both allies and rivals, as it positions the U.S. as a global leader in seabed mineral exploration and development, potentially disrupting established environmental norms and international agreements.</p>

          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that 50% of voters believe U.S. border security has improved in the last two years, a significant increase of 39 percentage points since the question was last posed. President Trump receives high approval ratings for his handling of border security, with 55% of voters approving his performance. However, opinions are more divided regarding the treatment of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers, with many feeling the administration is too harsh. The poll also reveals that immigration ranks lower than concerns about inflation, political divisions, and healthcare among voters.</p>

          <p>“The Accountant 2” is a disappointing sequel that lacks the charm and wit of the original, with Ben Affleck reprising his role as Christian Wolff, a neurodivergent accountant and assassin.

Jon Bernthal's character, Braxton, is reworked into a comedic sidekick, but his gags are clunky and ineffective.

          <p>The National Security Council (NSC) under President Trump is described as chaotic and unstable, marked by firings of career officials, disregard for security protocols, and the influence of online personalities like Laura Loomer. The NSC was quickly purged of expertise when Trump returned to power, with whole offices being emptied out. Trump's impatience with process, disregard for the law, and insistence on loyalty over expertise have contributed to the dysfunction. Key decisions are being made without traditional NSC processes, raising concerns about national security.</p>

The plan advocates for transforming the federal bureaucracy by firing civil servants, changing others into political appointees, and compelling the rest into obedience. Many of Trump's actions, such as the sacking of top generals and the repeal of Temporary Protected Status, align with Project 2025's recommendations.

While the Trump administration's arguments may be poorly constructed, the Court is expected to reinstate the ban, in part because a similar ban was upheld in 2019. The article also notes that the ban is likely to harm the United States by losing the expertise of trained military personnel.</p>
