        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the country. Through a $400 million purchase of preferred stock and warrants, the Pentagon will secure a stake of approximately 15% in the company. This strategic investment aims to bolster domestic production of rare earth magnets, which are critical for defense and commercial technologies, thereby reducing U.S. reliance on China for these essential materials. The news caused the company's shares to surge significantly in premarket trading.</p>

          <p>China has offered a first-ever public glimpse into the production facilities for its fifth-generation stealth fighters, subtly revealing them in a state television broadcast. The news report focused on the upgraded J-15T fighter, which is now equipped for catapult-assisted launches from aircraft carriers, a significant advancement for its naval aviation. While not explicitly named, the appearance of the new stealth aircraft, likely the J-35, suggests an increasing readiness to deploy advanced fighters on its growing carrier fleet. This development highlights China's accelerating military modernization and power projection capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual move, Bishop Alberto Rojas of the San Bernardino Diocese in California has issued a decree dispensing Catholics from their obligation to attend Mass. The decision cites genuine fear among parishioners of potential raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a "grave inconvenience" that impedes their spiritual well-being. This exemption, typically reserved for events like natural disasters or pandemics, marks a significant response to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement policies. The action has drawn notice from critics of the administration, including California's governor.</p>

          <p>A $9.4 billion spending reduction package championed by the Trump administration is facing potential challenges from within the Republican party in the Senate. The proposed cuts, which target foreign aid programs like PEPFAR and funding for public broadcasting, are causing concern among several GOP senators. Lawmakers like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have voiced opposition to specific elements of the House-passed bill, raising the possibility of amendments that could reduce the total amount of the cuts. This internal dissent sets the stage for a contentious debate as leadership pushes for a vote.</p>

          <p>A trustee at Columbia University, Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, has publicly called for the university's board to fully cooperate with the Trump administration's demands regarding campus antisemitism and Title VI compliance. In a formal letter, she criticized the university leadership's handling of the issue, stating it has tarnished Columbia's reputation and created significant legal and financial risks. The demand follows the release of text messages from the acting president suggesting Shendelman's removal and the federal government's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants to the university over its perceived inaction.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee has warned that Iran poses a "rising, persistent and unpredictable" threat to British national security. The inquiry highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted kidnappings or murders, against Iranian dissidents and Jewish and Israeli interests on UK soil since early 2022. The committee criticized the government for focusing too heavily on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of countering other activities like espionage and cyber attacks. It recommends a more strategic, long-term approach to manage the wide-ranging threat.</p>

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have declared a major incident over a large bonfire in south Belfast built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. Authorities are concerned because the structure is located near a major electricity substation that supplies power to two major hospitals, and it also contains asbestos. Belfast City Council has requested police assistance to help contractors dismantle the bonfire, leading to heightened tensions with bonfire builders and the local community. The situation has created a standoff, with loyalist activists threatening legal action to prevent the bonfire's removal.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 50% tariff on copper imports is raising alarms among economists and industry experts about a resulting surge in consumer prices. Copper is a fundamental component in a vast range of products, including electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. Experts warn that such a steep tariff would inevitably increase manufacturing costs, which would then be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. While the administration argues the tariff will rebuild the domestic copper industry, critics contend it will negatively impact the economy and raise costs for everyday goods.</p>

In separate health news, the CDC reports that U.S. measles cases have reached 1,288 this year, the highest number in 33 years.

This power, which allows a monarch to declare laws non-applicable to their friends, was abolished in England in 1689 and has been ruled unconstitutional in the U.S. Legal experts express alarm that this claim sets a precedent for executive overreach.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, has been struck by a massive overnight Russian attack involving approximately 400 drones and 18 missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. The assault killed at least two people, including a police officer, and injured sixteen others, with wreckage damaging residential buildings and a healthcare center. This attack is part of a recent escalation by Russia, which launched ten times more missile and munitions attacks in June compared to the previous year. The intensified aerial bombardment underscores the remote prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough in the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Propelled by intense investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, chipmaker Nvidia saw its market valuation briefly exceed an unprecedented $4 trillion. The surge reflects Wall Street's immense confidence in AI as a transformative technology, with Nvidia positioned as a primary beneficiary of the hardware race among tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Despite facing challenges from US-China trade tensions and new competitors, the company has continued to post massive earnings. Nvidia's success has been a key driver in the broader stock market's recovery, highlighting the technology sector's significant economic influence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza. This action follows a failed U.S. pressure campaign to have her removed from the post and represents the latest effort to penalize critics of Israel's war in Gaza. Albanese, a human rights lawyer, has described Israel's actions as a "genocide," a position denied by the U.S. and Israel but supported by some rights organizations. The move was condemned by rights experts and the UN Human Rights Council president, who called it an act of intimidation.</p>

          <p>An analysis identifies integrated energy giants Chevron and TotalEnergies as compelling high-yield dividend stocks for investors. Chevron is noted for its strong balance sheet and a 38-year history of annual dividend increases, offering stability for conservative investors. TotalEnergies provides a higher yield and is aggressively using its carbon fuel profits to transition into clean energy, a strategy that differentiates it from peers who cut dividends for similar shifts. The article suggests that recent weakness in oil prices has made both stocks attractively valued for different types of income-focused investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has approved Royal Mail's plan to reform its universal service obligation, ending the delivery of second-class letters on Saturdays. The change, intended to help the company cut costs amid declining letter volumes, will also see second-class mail delivered on alternating weekdays. While Royal Mail welcomed the move as necessary for financial sustainability, the decision was criticized by consumer and business groups who fear it will lead to a less reliable service and greater reliance on more expensive first-class mail. First-class letters will continue to be delivered six days a week.</p>

The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights ruled that her right to a fair hearing was violated by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court in a 2023 appeal. However, the ruling does not overturn the World Athletics regulations that restrict testosterone levels and prevent her from competing in her signature 800m event. While the decision is a significant moral victory and keeps her legal case alive, it does not provide an immediate path for her return to competition.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas, where only about 2.5% of homeowners in hard-hit Kerr County had flood insurance, serves as a stark reminder of a nationwide risk. Experts emphasize that standard homeowners policies explicitly exclude flood damage, requiring separate coverage. With 99% of U.S. counties having experienced a flood event in the past 20 years, and 40% of federal claims coming from outside high-risk zones, they stress that all homeowners should consider obtaining a policy. Coverage is available through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program as well as a growing number of private insurers.</p>

          <p>A new Republican spending bill has allocated an additional $75 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over four years, a 308% annual increase over its 2024 budget. This massive cash infusion will allow the agency to more than double its detention capacity from 41,500 to 116,000 beds. Critics and civil liberties advocates worry this will enable the Trump administration to dramatically scale up its controversial and indiscriminate enforcement tactics. While logistical hurdles may slow the administration's goals, the funding signals a significant expansion of immigration detention and enforcement activities.</p>

The attack, which involved sending the explosive-laden animal toward a platoon of soldiers, comes amid a surge in violence in the country.

Health experts and advocates warn that this will reverse decades of progress, leading to a spike in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths.

          <p>This opinion article explores the potential impact of implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) more broadly in California, drawing parallels to its use in New York City's recent elections. The author suggests that combining RCV with California's nonpartisan, top-two primary system could yield unique results, potentially eliminating the need for primary elections in many local races and saving taxpayer money. Proponents argue the system encourages more civil campaigning and improves representation. While the ultimate political realignment is unknown, the article posits that RCV is a reform worth considering for California's electoral system.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that a convicted former bishop and another ex-vicar from the Church in Wales are now facing new police investigations into historical sexual abuse. One victim has come forward to state that concerns about former Bishop Anthony Pierce were reported to church officials in 1986, yet he was later promoted. The investigation also details how Pierce, as bishop, allegedly failed to act on abuse claims made against a choirmaster. These revelations have prompted calls for a fully independent inquiry into the handling of sexual assault within the crisis-hit institution.</p>

          <p>Recent redistricting in Tarrant County, Texas, is being viewed by experts and critics as a blueprint for a broader Republican strategy to secure political advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The controversial new map, which critics label as racial gerrymandering, was pushed through by a county judge who openly stated his goal was to elect another Republican. This local effort comes as the Trump administration encourages more redrawing of maps in Texas. Experts suggest this is a preemptive move to offset potential Democratic gains in other states and reflects intense partisan maneuvering.</p>
