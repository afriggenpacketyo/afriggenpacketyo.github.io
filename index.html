          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators, led by UK Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, marched through central London to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza. Protesters expressed support for Israel and voiced opposition to the UK's potential recognition of a Palestinian state, viewing it as a concession to Hamas. The event, which saw one arrest and minor scuffles, highlighted the ongoing concern for the estimated 50 hostages remaining, with many participants expressing fear and a rise in antisemitism in the UK since the October 7th attacks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is facing turmoil regarding its accelerated approval process for drugs targeting rare diseases. This issue is highlighted by the case of Sarepta Therapeutics, whose expensive gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy received approval despite limited clinical data. However, after three patient deaths and concerns about liver failure, the FDA has requested the company to suspend the drug's distribution, causing a significant drop in its stock value and raising questions about the agency's risk assessment.</p>

          <p>A significant fire spread rapidly across Arthur's Seat, a prominent hill in Edinburgh's Holyrood Park, prompting a large response from firefighters. Authorities have urged the public to avoid the area, and smoke was visible across the city, which is currently crowded with tourists for the Edinburgh festivals. Eyewitnesses described the fire growing quickly, fueled by winds and the unusually dry conditions that have affected Scotland this summer, following a series of recent wildfires in the Highlands.</p>

Crawford argued the move would be safer for hostages, while Gottheimer endorsed it as a temporary measure to dismantle Hamas before establishing a new governing structure. Their comments came after Israel's security cabinet approved the plan to occupy Gaza City, aiming to demilitarize the strip and establish an alternative civil administration.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have dismissed claims made by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in her upcoming memoir that Salmond himself may have leaked details of a sexual misconduct investigation against him. Kenny MacAskill, leader of the Alba party, called Sturgeon a "hypocrite" for the suggestion, describing it as a "fabrication." The controversy stems from a 2019 government probe into Salmond, which was later deemed unlawful, and highlights the deep and lasting rift between the two former leaders of the Scottish National Party.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed in collaboration with Adidas appropriated a traditional Mexican design. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huarache sandals made by Indigenous artisans, but the article states it was produced without partnership or credit to the origin communities, drawing criticism from figures including the Mexican president. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in direct collaboration with the Oaxacan community.</p>

          <p>An upcoming meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is framed as a high-stakes fulfillment of a Trump campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The summit was arranged after Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, engaged in back-channel discussions, and it proceeds despite concerns from Ukraine and European allies that Trump might concede Ukrainian territory. The article notes Trump's frustration with Putin's prior reluctance to negotiate and the risk that the talks could result in a deal unfavorable to Kyiv.</p>
