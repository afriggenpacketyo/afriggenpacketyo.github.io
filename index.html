          <p>President Trump hinted at the possibility of lowering tariffs on goods imported from China as trade officials from both nations prepared for discussions in Switzerland. Trump mentioned that the existing tariffs had reached a high point, implying an expected decrease. He expressed optimism about the upcoming meeting, describing it as a friendly endeavor. China's Vice Foreign Minister also conveyed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. This article underscores the growing economic pressures on both Washington and Beijing, suggesting a transactional de-escalation might be on the horizon, but analysts caution that systemic frictions will require prolonged negotiations.</p>

          <p>China has been attempting a charm offensive in Europe, marked by celebratory events and diplomatic exchanges, to capitalize on shifts in U.S. foreign policy under President Trump.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health discovered high lead levels in soil at properties previously cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after catastrophic wildfires. Soil testing revealed that a significant percentage of homesites in the Eaton burn scar still exceeded California's lead standards for residential properties. These findings raise concerns about the effectiveness of the federal cleanup efforts and the potential health risks to residents, particularly children. County officials are recommending soil impact assessments as part of rebuilding plans, and a program is expected to start on May 19 to help homeowners test their yards for lead.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. following the implementation of tariffs. While exports to the U.S. dropped by over 20%, overall exports rose by 8.1%, surpassing expectations. This increase is attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts. The Chinese government is also encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market to mitigate the impact of tariffs, potentially leading to deflation.</p>

Russia's increasing assertiveness in the Arctic and its economic cooperation with China have further intensified U.S. interest.

          <p>A pro-Palestinian rally at Brooklyn College turned chaotic as demonstrators clashed with police, leading to arrests and the use of a Taser. The incident occurred after demonstrators left the college grounds and gathered outside, condemning Israel's actions in Gaza. The police moved in to make arrests after tensions escalated, resulting in physical altercations. College officials stated that demonstrators violated college policy by setting up tents, prompting the police intervention.</p>

          <p>Developed nations that produce tungsten products are starting to diversify their supply sources after China added five critical industrial metals, including tungsten, to its export restriction list. This has caused panic in the industry, which has relied on readily available exports from China for three decades. The element is used to make cutting tools, drill bits and heavy machinery parts. US defence contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures to revive economic growth have not boosted its stock market, as concerns over economic deterioration outweigh policy optimism.

For a meaningful rally, investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures that directly boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector.</p>

The order cited unjust racial discrimination as the reason for prioritizing their humanitarian relief.

          <p>Analysts are questioning the benefits of President Trump's new trade deal with the UK for America. While the White House touts the agreement as a 'breakthrough', the 10% import tax announced last month on most UK goods will remain. Critics argue that the substantive changes are limited, with the US agreeing to walk back some import taxes on strategic sectors. The deal has drawn criticism from American carmakers, who note that the plans make UK-made cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies.</p>
