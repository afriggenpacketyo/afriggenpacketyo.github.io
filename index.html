          <p>The Trump administration's proposed cuts to HIV research funding are raising significant concerns within the public health community about their potential impact on ending the epidemic in the United States. Experts worry that reducing financial support could stall or even reverse decades of hard-won progress against the virus. This development introduces uncertainty for ongoing research projects and prevention programs that are considered crucial for achieving public health goals related to HIV and AIDS.</p>

          <p>The human toll of the catastrophic Texas floods is becoming clearer as victims are identified, including an eight-year-old girl and the director of an all-girls' summer camp. The girl, Renee Smajstrla, was remembered by her family as “living her best life” at Camp Mystic before the floods. Jane Ragsdale, the director of Heart O' the Hills camp, was described as its “heart and soul.” These personal stories highlight the profound tragedy as search efforts continue for many still missing.</p>

          <p>Israel will send a negotiating team to Qatar for ceasefire talks, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, signaling a continuation of diplomatic efforts. However, the same statement clarified that the changes requested by Hamas to the U.S.-mediated proposal are considered unacceptable to Israel. This development follows Hamas's own "positive response" to the framework, creating a complex and uncertain path forward in the negotiations to end the nearly 21-month-long conflict.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire in a rural part of San Luis Obispo County has grown to nearly 80,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in California so far this year. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, is threatening about 50 structures and has forced over 200 people to evacuate.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is facing backlash from Jewish organizations after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" during a rally in Iowa. When describing some bankers, he used the slur, which originates from a villainous Jewish moneylender character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." The Anti-Defamation League called the comment "very troubling," though Trump later told reporters he was unaware of the term's offensive connotations, defining it simply as a greedy moneylender.</p>
