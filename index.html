          <p>A suspect is in custody after multiple people were stabbed at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. Officials at a local medical center confirmed they were treating 11 victims from the incident, though their conditions were not immediately released. The Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the attack, and authorities have not yet provided details on a possible motive. Governor Gretchen Whitmer acknowledged the "brutal act of violence" and stated she is monitoring the situation closely.</p>

          <p>Recent scientific studies are uncovering the potential long-term health dangers of nanoplastics, microscopic particles originating from plastic waste. Dr. Matt Campen's lab at the University of New Mexico has discovered these particles in human brain tissue for the first time, finding higher concentrations in the brains of dementia patients. Other research links nanoplastic pollution to increased risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Experts are now advocating for more robust action on plastic pollution, comparing its potential harm to that of food dyes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Houston Texans running back Joe Mixon is expected to be sidelined for the entire preseason due to a persistent ankle issue. The two-time Pro Bowler began training camp on the non-football injury list after sustaining the injury earlier in the offseason. This is not Mixon's first struggle with injuries, as he has previously missed games due to ankle problems and a concussion. The Texans, who recently signed All-Pro Nick Chubb, will further evaluate Mixon's condition closer to their regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Rams.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were evacuated after being stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours. The train stopped due to a power failure shortly after its journey began, causing the lights and air conditioning to fail in the summer heat. The rescue operation was prolonged when some passengers attempted to leave on foot, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety. Ultimately, all passengers were safely evacuated via emergency exits and buses, with only two individuals requiring on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have announced they will conduct aid airdrops and implement "humanitarian pauses" to facilitate aid distribution in Gaza, where the malnutrition crisis is deepening.

Humanitarian groups report a severe crisis, with Médecins Sans Frontières noting that cases of severe malnutrition in young children have tripled in two weeks.

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief, as a more severe injury could have resulted in a long-term absence for the two-time AL MVP. Judge, who received a platelet-rich plasma injection, hopes to return in 10 days to two weeks, initially as a designated hitter.

          <p>This article reflects on the legacy of the early 2000s MTV show "The Osbournes," which transformed Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved reality TV father figure. The show pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, blending the family's spectacular fame with mundane domestic life, a formula that captivated millions of viewers. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," "The Osbournes" offered an unprecedented, often unscripted look into a celebrity family's daily chaos and genuine affection. While the constant filming took a personal toll on the family, the program's success reshaped the television landscape for years to come.</p>

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, this article explores the physiological reasons behind the intense physical reactions to watching football. Psychologists explain that high-stakes matches trigger a hormonal stress response, increasing adrenaline and cortisol, which can elevate heart rates and affect sleep and behavior. This "fight or flight" response is a sign of deep emotional investment in the team. Experts advise managing this stress by getting adequate rest, planning the day, eating well, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures remaining below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s.

While coastal areas remain cool and drizzly, other parts of California have faced oppressive heat, highlighting the state's diverse microclimates. Experts caution that despite the cool start, hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

          <p>Joseph Czuba, the 73-year-old Illinois landlord sentenced to 53 years in prison for a fatal hate crime, has died in custody. Czuba was convicted of murdering 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi and attempting to murder his mother, Hanan Shaheen, in October 2023. Prosecutors demonstrated that Czuba targeted the pair because of their Islamic faith and in response to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war. He stabbed the young boy 26 times in a brutal attack that drew international condemnation and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas from Burbank, California, executed a sudden dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential midair collision. The pilots of the Boeing 737 responded to an onboard traffic alert warning them of another aircraft, a decommissioned fighter jet, in their vicinity. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating the incident, which occurred just six minutes after takeoff. While no passengers reported injuries, one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, and the flight landed safely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in federal court, with a case challenging his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The administration has used this law to justify major tariffs, but a lower court ruled this was an overreach of presidential power, a decision now under appeal. The outcome of this and other related lawsuits could invalidate many of Trump's recent trade deals and tariff implementations. Analysts suggest that if the Supreme Court ultimately rules against the administration, it could unravel a cornerstone of its economic and foreign policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a two-day visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations with the island nation. The visit comes after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on an anti-India platform, had previously demanded the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. However, facing economic struggles, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric, and Modi's visit included the announcement of a $565 million credit line and inauguration of several India-funded infrastructure projects. The trip highlights the geopolitical competition between India and China for influence in the strategically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's hopes for victory against India in the fourth Test are clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes' fitness to bowl on the final day. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four, with the team reporting he was "a bit stiff and sore." Stokes has a history of injury issues, and his inability to bowl would be a significant blow to England's attack as they push for a series-leveling win. The all-rounder's workload is a growing concern, with the team's management acknowledging the need to manage him carefully.</p>

Trump stated, "It's something I haven't thought about," a reply Honig called an answer to "the easiest question in human history." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in the sexual abuse of underage girls with Epstein. Honig found it bewildering that a pardon for one of modern history's worst child sex traffickers would not be met with an immediate and definitive "no."</p>

Speaking to the BBC, Chadha said the recent success of England's Lionesses and the growth of women's football made it the right time to revisit the characters. The original film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female athletes. Chadha is unsure if the follow-up will be a film or a TV series but hopes to reunite the original cast.</p>

In a promotional video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's Chris Martin, deftly avoided the scandal while promoting the company's data services.
