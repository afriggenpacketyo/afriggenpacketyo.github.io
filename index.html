          <p>New sumo grand champion Onosato performed his first ring-entering ceremony at Tokyo's Meiji Jingu shrine to mark his promotion to yokozuna. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture officially became sumo's 75th yokozuna on Wednesday, achieving the rank at a record pace after just 13 professional tournaments. Under rainy skies, Onosato stomped his feet and sent echoes reverberating around the shrine as he solemnly performed the ceremony, which was not open to the public. The former grand champion, now stablemaster Nishonoseki, praised his protege's confident performance of the ritual.</p>

          <p>Despite exceeding earnings and revenue projections with an 8% sales increase, Costco shares experienced a slight decline. The company's leaders mentioned that tariffs have caused higher costs and other challenges, prompting adjustments to the supply chain and price increases in some instances. Costco reported net income of $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, for the quarter ending May 11, compared to $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per share, the previous year. While some retailers warn of rising prices due to tariffs, Costco is attempting to mitigate these costs by rushing orders, rerouting goods, and sourcing more private-label items locally.

          <p>This article discusses Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the cause of rising autism rates, a view that clashes with the consensus among autism scientists. Experts say that the increase in autism diagnoses is primarily due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and improved screening. They emphasize that genetic research has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, making genetics the most significant driver. Concerns are raised that Kennedy's focus on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which is leading to promising new therapies for severe autism.</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the director of the French Open, addressed criticism concerning the scheduling of night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches. Since 2023, no women's singles match has been scheduled during the primetime slot, raising concerns about the promotion of women's tennis. Mauresmo explained that the decision is based on the potential for women's matches to conclude quickly, as they are played over three sets, and that the tournament aims to avoid late finishes by limiting the night session to a single match.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being pinned face-down by a 700-pound boulder in a creek, thanks to his wife who held his head above water for three hours to prevent him from drowning. The incident occurred near Godwin Glacier outside of Seward, where Kell Morris was hiking with his wife, Jo Roop. Roop, a retired Alaska State Trooper, used her law enforcement experience to provide precise GPS coordinates to dispatch after trying to free him. Firefighters used airbags, ropes, and brute force to lift the boulder, and a helicopter transported them to the scene, ultimately saving Morris's life.</p>

          <p>The United States Court of International Trade unanimously ruled against President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs, asserting that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited tariff authority. The court emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The ruling also cited the "major-questions doctrine," requiring Congress to clearly authorize the executive branch to make decisions of vast economic and political significance. The decision imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, though the administration has appealed the ruling.</p>

However, 72% of hiring managers still offer higher salaries to candidates with master's degrees, with some offering increases of 10% to 20% or higher. This discrepancy is attributed to the perceived symbolic value of advanced degrees, signaling drive and commitment, though skills-based hiring is becoming more prevalent.

          <p>President Trump accused China of violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after both countries agreed to a temporary easing of tariffs. While Trump did not specify the nature of the violation, the accusation comes shortly after a legal challenge to his trade agenda. A federal court had frozen most of his sweeping tariffs, but a federal appeals court temporarily halted that decision, allowing the tariffs to continue for now. Rare earths, materials used in high-tech products, could be at the heart of Trump's complaint.</p>
