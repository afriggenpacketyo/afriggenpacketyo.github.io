          <p>The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has established a Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) in southern Israel, serving as a hub for Gaza stabilization efforts following a U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan. Around 200 U.S. troops are involved, focusing on coordinating humanitarian, logistical, and security assistance from international partners into Gaza, without deploying directly into the territory. The CMCC aims to oversee the ceasefire's implementation and foster collaborative planning among various stakeholders for a peaceful transition. However, the ongoing delay in Hamas returning all deceased hostages continues to impact the progression of the peace deal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking a $230 million settlement from his Justice Department for damages related to investigations into his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. The administrative claims would require approval from top DOJ officials, some of whom previously served as Trump's defense attorneys, raising significant conflict of interest concerns. Trump stated he was not seeking the money for himself but would donate it to charity, acknowledging the unusual nature of the situation. This article highlights the ethical complexities of a sitting president seeking such a payment from his own administration.</p>

          <p>A recent technical issue at Amazon Web Services' Northern Virginia facilities caused a widespread internet outage, affecting over 1,000 sites and services globally and costing companies billions. This incident highlights the modern internet's reliance on a few massive cloud providers like Amazon, whose dominance creates single points of failure. The article discusses the trade-off between cloud accessibility and the fragility it introduces, emphasizing that the internet, often perceived as a free resource, is largely controlled by a small group of corporations. It raises concerns about the societal impact when such critical infrastructure experiences disruptions.</p>

          <p>Federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carried out a joint operation on Canal Street in New York City's Chinatown, a prominent area known for vendors selling counterfeit designer goods. The enforcement action prompted vendors to pack up and flee, leading to subsequent protests and the presence of City Hall officials to monitor the situation. City Hall emphasized its non-cooperation with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, aligning with Mayor Adams' view that undocumented New Yorkers should not be targets.

          <p>The Electric Playhouse, a large virtual arcade located on the Las Vegas Strip, has filed for bankruptcy after operating for just one year, facing pending eviction and millions in unpaid claims. This high-tech gaming and dining center, situated within a mall at Caesars Palace, utilized a network of sensors to create interactive games where guests used their bodies instead of controllers. Court documents reveal the company possesses between $1 million and $10 million in assets but anticipates being unable to pay unsecured creditors. The article suggests that a downturn in Las Vegas tourism, with fewer visitors compared to the previous year, contributed to the venue's financial turmoil.</p>

The core disagreement remains Moscow's steadfast refusal to implement a ceasefire along the current front line, a proposal that has garnered support from Kyiv and European leaders. Russia, conversely, insists on the complete withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the embattled eastern regions and a comprehensive address to the "root causes of the conflict."

          <p>Vilnius Airport, Lithuania's primary international airport, was forced to suspend operations for the second time this month due to dozens of smugglers' balloons entering its airspace. The National Crisis Management Center confirmed that these "weather balloons" are being used to smuggle cigarettes from Belarus, a method that has intensified since Lithuania constructed a border fence and closed land crossings. This disruption led to the redirection of eight incoming flights, causing significant inconvenience for passengers.

CEOs like Larry Fink see it as capital "well spent" for U.S. leadership in AI, while former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger believes it's a bubble with several years before it pops.
