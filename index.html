          <h2>Trump Claims Houthi Group Has 'Capitulated,' Announces End to U.S. Bombing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 15:40:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared that the U.S. military would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen, asserting that the group had 'capitulated' and promised to halt attacks on American commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. However, details of the arrangement remain vague, with the Houthis not issuing any public statement on the agreement. Oman's foreign ministry reported a ceasefire brokered by Oman, ensuring freedom of navigation, but the Houthis' political bureau stated that Israeli and American aggression would not go unanswered. The group has been targeting ships in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea since 2023 in response to Israeli military action in Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Law Firms Reluctant to Provide Pro Bono Services in Immigration Cases Due to Trump's Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 15:35:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elite law firms are increasingly hesitant to offer pro bono legal assistance in lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's policies, particularly those related to immigration. This reluctance stems from fears of incurring the president's wrath, as Trump has previously targeted firms with executive orders that could cripple their ability to represent clients before the federal government. Some firms have opted to reach deals with the White House to avoid such orders, while others have challenged them in court. The chilling effect has made it more difficult for public interest groups to find legal representation for immigrants, forcing them to seek new partners and expand their own staff.</p>

          <p>A U.S. House hearing has been convened in response to a report detailing suspected Chinese surveillance sites in Cuba. The hearing focuses on findings from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which identified four suspected signals intelligence facilities, including one near Bejucal undergoing upgrades. This facility, known for Cold War surveillance activity, appears to have a new circularly disposed antenna array capable of locating long-distance radio signals. Lawmakers express concern over Beijing's expanding intelligence footprint near U.S. territory, urging the Trump administration to take a firmer stance.</p>

He also shares his personal story of escaping Vienna as a Jewish child and later learning of his father's murder by the Germans.

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can begin enforcing its ban on transgender troops serving in the military, reversing lower court rulings that had blocked the policy. The ruling was brief and unsigned, with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting without providing reasoning. The ban stems from an executive order issued by President Trump, revoking a previous order that allowed transgender service members to serve openly. The Defense Department implemented the order, requiring transgender troops to be forced out of the military, impacting approximately 4,200 current service members.</p>

The Trump administration restricted the shipment of Nvidia's H20 chips to China without a license, which Nvidia said would result in a $5.5 billion quarterly charge.

Investors appear to be assuaged by Buffett's plans to remain as chairman and his endorsement of Abel's management. While Abel's stock-picking abilities are questioned, Buffett's continued involvement and the board's support seem to have eased concerns among everyday investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed Frank Bisignano, a tech CEO and donor to President Trump, as the commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA). Former commissioners and advocates have raised concerns about proposed restructuring and mass layoffs at the agency, which serves over 73 million Americans. Democrats have questioned Bisignano's communication with members of Elon Musk's team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Advocates fear that changes will lead to longer wait times for services for millions of Americans.</p>

          <p>Columbia University administrators and trustees have ordered a review of the university senate, which could redefine control over student demonstrations, particularly in response to the pro-Palestinian protests of 2024. Some trustees and administrators blame the senate for delaying discipline of protesters and have accused the body of antisemitism, which senators deny. The review follows accusations that the senate thwarted discipline against antisemitic conduct. The move highlights ideological divisions between faculty members and trustees and could lead to significant changes in the university's protest policies.</p>

The Trump administration argued the policy was a "medical" exclusion and that gender dysphoria presented problems for unit cohesion.
