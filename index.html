          <p>Japan and the United States are currently engaged in negotiations regarding tariffs, which include those impacting the automotive industry. This development suggests a potential shift in trade relations between the two economic powers, particularly concerning key sectors like automobiles. The outcome of these discussions could significantly influence market dynamics and trade flows between Japan and the U.S., affecting manufacturers, consumers, and related industries. The negotiations reflect ongoing efforts to recalibrate economic partnerships amidst evolving global trade policies.</p>

          <p>In response to a deadly attack on tourists in the Pahalgam region of Kashmir, the Indian government has banned imports from Pakistan, citing national security and public policy interests. This action further escalates already strained relations between the two neighboring countries, who have also closed a key trade route and suspended water treaty discussions. Pakistan has responded by halting border trade, closing its airspace to Indian flights, and expelling Indian diplomats, raising concerns about potential military action in the disputed Kashmir region. The ban underscores the severe impact of geopolitical tensions on trade and diplomatic relations in South Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is launching legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT argues that the new school report cards, intended to replace the previous one or two-word judgements, still constitute a crude grading system. This decision follows calls for delay after the suicide of head teacher Ruth Perry after an Ofsted inspection, with concerns raised that the changes will negatively impact the mental health of education staff. Ofsted defends the proposals, asserting that they prioritize mental health support, and considers the union's claims untenable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry. The administration aims to encourage manufacturers to relocate supply chains to the U.S. To ease the impact, carmakers can offset tariffs for a portion of a vehicle's retail price. Japan's auto industry, a major economic driver, faces significant challenges as it exports approximately 6 trillion yen worth of vehicles to the U.S. annually, which, along with auto parts, accounts for one-third of Japan's total exports to the U.S.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, has injured nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child, as seventeen drones struck civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, and shops.

The attack occurred shortly before Russia's planned three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed as insincere.

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon region of Bolivia after their small plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, stated that they stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators, which were potentially deterred by leaking petrol. The survivors ate cassava flour brought by one of the passengers while awaiting rescue, and were eventually found by local fishermen who alerted authorities.

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned by former President Nana Akufo-Addo and designed by architect David Adjaye, has stalled due to economic mismanagement and corruption allegations. The $400 million project, which has already consumed $58 million in public funds, has become a symbol of financial distress in the debt-ridden West African country. The new government has halted funding and initiated an anticorruption investigation, raising questions about the project's future and the use of public resources.

Hilary Fordwich and Ian Pelham Turner believe the divide has widened, with William prioritizing the protection of the monarchy. Harry's recent BBC interview and memoir, 'Spare,' have reportedly exacerbated the situation, leading William to remain resolute in his stance. Harry expressed a desire for reconciliation with his family, especially given King Charles's cancer diagnosis, but admitted the King is not speaking to him due to security concerns.</p>

          <p>Analysts express skepticism about Ukraine's capacity to supplant China as a major source of critical minerals for the U.S., despite a recent agreement between the two countries. Most of Ukraine's mineral reserves are located in areas occupied by Russia, and extraction will take years due to limited processing capabilities. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth elements, possessing approximately 60% of the reserves and 90% of the refining capacity. This disparity suggests that American companies will continue to rely on China for these essential materials.</p>

          <p>A review of assisted dying policy in England and Wales suggests that assisted deaths could exceed 4,000 in the tenth year after the law is enacted, assuming MPs vote in favor. The impact assessment, intended to inform MPs' debate on the issue, estimates initial numbers will be low but grow over time, with savings for the NHS potentially ranging from Â£5.84m to Â£59.6m after ten years. However, staffing and training costs could exceed Â£10m annually, and the overall financial impact remains uncertain. The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, returns to the House of Commons for a crucial vote later this month.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a U.S. economic 'golden age' is off to a chaotic start, with the first quarter showing a contraction in GDP after three years of growth. Trump quickly blamed the 'Biden Overhang' for the dismal numbers, while simultaneously claiming credit for positive job reports. Growth was challenged by the new administration's trade policies, including tariffs, leading to a surge in imports and a decline in consumer spending. The implementation of tariffs has created confusion and uncertainty for businesses, raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies in Friede's blood protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes in animal tests. This could lead to a universal antivenom, addressing the up to 140,000 deaths and disabilities caused by snakebites annually. The research identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target classes of neurotoxins, offering potential protection against numerous elapid species.</p>

In 2024, the museum recorded 2.87 million visitors, with the largest overseas group coming from South Korea. The decline is attributed to deteriorating cross-strait relations, political factors, and changes in tourism policies.</p>
