          <p>The White House announced that President Trump will visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as a significant escalation of his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. This marks the first official presidential visit to the central bank in nearly two decades, breaking with the long-standing tradition of respecting its political independence. The visit brings Trump's criticism over the Fed's refusal to lower interest rates directly to the institution, symbolizing a challenge to its autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed Customs and Border Protection officials to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This changes a long-standing policy under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which previously required these minors from non-contiguous countries to be sent to government shelters. If the teens decline the offer, they will still be transferred to the care of Health and Human Services, but the new policy expands a practice previously limited to minors from Mexico and Canada.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has canceled thousands of scheduled water pollution tests over the last three months due to significant staff shortages at its main laboratory. The suspended tests were intended to detect inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff. Critics and former employees warn that this reduction in monitoring could compromise the ability to track river health and identify pollution problems, while the EA insists its overall testing program remains robust despite operating below capacity.</p>

Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, born from a factory accident, resulted in the detuned, powerful riffs that became the genre's foundation, influencing countless bands for decades to come.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's Inspector General is reportedly investigating whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared classified details of a military strike in Yemen on the commercial messaging app Signal. The information, which included operational details like takeoff times and targets, was allegedly marked "SECRET/NOFORN" in an original email, undercutting claims that no classified data was shared. The incident has raised serious concerns about operational security and the proper handling of sensitive government communications within the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed three executive orders aimed at establishing U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, including one specifically targeting what the White House calls "woke" AI models. The order requires federal agencies to procure only politically neutral AI systems free from "ideological dogmas such as DEI." Other orders are designed to expedite the permitting process for data center construction and to promote the export of American AI technology, as part of a broader plan to win the global AI race.</p>

The blaze prompted the temporary closure of the freeway in both directions as it jumped across the lanes and pushed toward the Prado Dam area. By Wednesday evening, firefighters had stopped the fire's forward rate of spread and achieved 5% containment, with the freeway reopened as crews continued mop-up operations.</p>

In the first six months of the second Trump administration, ICE recorded nearly 150,000 removals, a pace that would exceed 300,000 for the year. While this is a significant increase driven by a sweeping enforcement mandate, it still falls far short of the administration's stated goal of 1 million annual deportations, highlighting operational and legal constraints.</p>

Experts advise prospective buyers to consider homes that have been on the market longer for negotiation leverage and to look for "ugly" houses in good neighborhoods to find value.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's new "AI Action Plan" suggests it heavily favors the interests of large technology companies by prioritizing rapid, unregulated development. The plan, which aims for "global AI dominance," proposes stripping away environmental and state-level regulations to accelerate the construction of data centers and energy infrastructure. Critics argue this "Build, Baby, Build!" approach, shaped by input from firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, pushes a "try-first" culture that sidelines public risk for corporate gain.</p>
