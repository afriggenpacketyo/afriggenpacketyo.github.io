          <p>Amid escalating geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing, wealthy Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their capital away from the U.S. real estate market. In 2024, there was a notable shift towards markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This trend marks a significant change from 2023 when the U.S. was the top choice for Chinese buyers, according to Juwai IQI. Increased scrutiny of property deals and rising protectionism have contributed to this shift, with Chinese investment in U.S. homes dropping significantly from its peak in 2017.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill allocating $1 billion for a school voucher program, fulfilling a campaign promise to provide school choice for families. The program will allow parents to use public funds to pay for private school tuition or homeschooling costs, with families receiving up to $10,000 per year, and children with disabilities potentially qualifying for as much as $30,000 per year. Supporters say it will give parents more options, while critics argue that it will pull financial resources from public schools and subsidize private education for wealthy families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could cost up to $4.5 billion per year by 2030.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Ezra Klein reflects on the selection of JD Vance as Donald Trump's vice president, viewing it as a pivotal moment foreshadowing the structure of Trump's second term. Klein argues that unlike Trump's first term, which involved uneasy alliances and internal checks, his second term is characterized by loyalists and enforcers who prioritize Trump's favor above all else. This shift signals the removal of guardrails and the absence of dissenting voices, leading to a presidency defined by ferocity and recklessness. The article suggests that the choice of Vance revealed the absence of skeptics and the lack of concessions in Trump's second term.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, effectively banning the sale of EU citizenship in exchange for investments. The court found that Malta's policy made nationality a "mere commercial transaction" and undermined the solidarity and mutual trust between EU member states. While this ruling ends passport sales, "golden visas" offering residence permits for investments remain in place in many EU countries.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a lower court's ruling that would have allowed Voice of America (VOA) employees to return to work, leaving the broadcaster's future uncertain. The VOA has been largely silent since March due to an executive order by President Trump, which resulted in over 1,000 employees being placed on leave and 600 contractors being terminated.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships choose not to legally marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, highlights that this issue is particularly prevalent among those in their 20s, with approximately 40% citing the surname law as a deterrent to marriage. Many in this age group expressed a willingness to legally marry if separate surnames were permitted, revealing a significant impact of the law on marriage decisions. The survey also estimates that over half a million people would marry if this law was changed.</p>
