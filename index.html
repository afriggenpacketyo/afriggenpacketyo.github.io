          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity when renewing or applying for passports and to select "X" as a gender marker. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued that the policy was discriminatory. The White House criticized the ruling, while the Justice Department has appealed the previous decision. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering joining Israel in strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. The decision follows allegations from Israel that Iran is rapidly progressing toward building nuclear weapons, though a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year stated that Iran is not currently building such weapons. There is disagreement among Trump's advisors on how to proceed. The president has indicated a potential for U.S. involvement through recent social media posts, though the administration has previously stated it is not involved in Israel's offensive. </p>

The judges on the panel seemed to indicate they might have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops. The court is considering whether Trump exceeded his authority in invoking a law that allows federal deployment in response to a "rebellion or danger of a rebellion." Los Angeles's mayor lifted a curfew amid the protests. </p>
