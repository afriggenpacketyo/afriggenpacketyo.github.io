            <h2>Trump Administration Claims Lack of Authority to Return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 21:35:22 EDT</div>

            <p>Despite a court order, the Trump administration asserts it cannot compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported due to an administrative error. El Salvador's President Bukele stated he would not voluntarily return Abrego Garcia, whom the administration alleges is a gang member. The Department of Homeland Security argues it lacks the authority to forcibly extract someone from a foreign nation's custody. This situation arises after the Supreme Court ruled the administration should facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, raising questions about the administration's compliance with judicial orders.</p>

            <p>Mark Zuckerberg defended Meta against allegations of operating a social media monopoly during a landmark antitrust trial brought by the FTC. The FTC argues that Meta unfairly dominated the market by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, seeking to force a spinoff of these apps. Zuckerberg testified that Meta improved Instagram and that competition exists from platforms like TikTok and X. The trial is expected to last two months, with the FTC pointing to Zuckerberg's past emails about 'neutralizing' Instagram as evidence of anti-competitive intent.</p>

Respondents also expressed concerns about finding skilled labor and the Trump administration's inconsistent strategy.

            <p>California's earthquake early warning system, ShakeAlert, successfully alerted users in some areas before shaking was felt during a magnitude 5.2 earthquake near Julian, CA. The system relies on seismic sensors to detect shaking and send alerts to users through apps like MyShake and Android phones. The alerts provided crucial seconds of lead time, allowing people to take protective actions. Earthquake early warning systems are becoming commonplace in seismically active regions worldwide.</p>
