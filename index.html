          <p>Ten Americans detained in Venezuela have been freed and are returning to the U.S. following a complex three-way prisoner exchange. The deal involved the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador, where the U.S. facilitated the return of 252 Venezuelan nationals from an El Salvadoran prison in exchange for the Americans' release. As part of the agreement, Venezuela also freed dozens of its own political prisoners. A senior administration official confirmed that no more Americans remain wrongfully detained in Venezuela following this diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, the first significant federal legislation to regulate cryptocurrency, specifically focusing on stablecoins. The bill, which received bipartisan support, aims to make stablecoins more mainstream by allowing banks to issue them. However, the law has drawn criticism from some Democrats, like Rep. Maxine Waters, who point to potential conflicts of interest. A crypto firm with which the Trump family has significant financial ties recently launched its own stablecoin, raising concerns about the president's family benefiting from the new regulations.

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deceased were all veteran members of the department's elite Arson Explosives Detail, with a combined 74 years of service. The blast occurred in a parking lot at the Biscailuz Center Training Academy, and while the exact cause is under investigation, officials believe it may have been triggered by explosive material recovered a day earlier. Sheriff Robert Luna described the incident as the department's largest single loss of life since 1857.</p>

          <p>Netflix recently reported strong quarterly earnings, with significant growth in revenue and a successful implementation of price increases and ad-supported tiers. This performance is seen as a positive indicator for Disney, suggesting a healthy market for streaming services where consumers are willing to pay for premium content. Analysts believe Disney can similarly boost its direct-to-consumer profitability through price adjustments and advertising without losing subscribers. The success of Netflix's model provides a promising read-through for Disney's upcoming earnings report for its streaming platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

It highlights the irony of these figures, who built their brands on questioning official narratives, now trusting the government's word.

          <p>Following the announcement that Stephen Colbert's "The Late Show" on CBS will be ending, President Trump expressed his approval on social media, calling Colbert a "loser" with no talent. Trump also suggested that Jimmy Kimmel's show should be next to be canceled. The cancellation came shortly after Colbert criticized CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, for a $16 million settlement with Trump, leading to speculation from critics and some politicians that the decision was politically motivated. CBS has stated the cancellation was a "purely financial" decision.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that a majority of high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more annually, still struggle with credit card debt, often due to "lifestyle creep." This article outlines several strategies these earners can use to manage their debt effectively. Options include using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates and leveraging 0% APR balance transfer cards to pay down principal without interest. Other recommendations are to negotiate directly with creditors for a lower APR or to work with a financial advisor for a tailored debt-payoff plan.</p>

          <p>A woman in Garden Grove, California, was found dead in her home, and police have linked her killing to an attempted murder-suicide hundreds of miles away in Stockton. Authorities believe the victim's husband, Miguel Lopez, killed her before driving north, where he shot and critically injured another man and then killed himself. The victim, Crystal Gonzalez, was discovered after one of her two young children, who were unharmed in the home, called police for help. The children have been orphaned by the tragic events.</p>

          <p>A historical overview highlights that many societies throughout history, from ancient Greece and Rome to samurai-era Japan, had more fluid and accepting views on gender and sexuality than modern Western cultures. The article notes that concepts like a "third gender" existed in various cultures, and same-sex relationships were common, citing examples like the Roman Emperor Hadrian and the poet Sappho. It contrasts this with periods of severe persecution, often justified by religious doctrine. The piece argues that today's hard-won LGBTQ+ rights must be protected from modern attempts to reverse them.</p>

          <p>The parents of Kaylee Goncalves, one of the four University of Idaho students murdered in 2022, say they still lack answers about the motive behind the killings, even after Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty.

With a gag order now lifted, the family's attorney plans to request investigative materials from prosecutors to learn more about the circumstances of their daughter's death.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed that its affluent customer base continues to spend heavily, with total card spending up 7% in the second quarter. However, the company noted a specific weak spot: spending on airfare has stalled, remaining flat compared to the previous year. The weakness is concentrated in domestic economy class tickets, while premium cabin and high-cost hotel bookings remain strong. This trend, combined with declining airfare prices, could be a concern for Amex given its extensive partnerships with airlines and network of airport lounges. (not investment advice)</p>

Eleven separate storms in the U.S. each caused over a billion dollars in insured losses.

          <p>This financial analysis compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return over the term. The article calculates that, based on current rates, a money market account would earn slightly more over periods ranging from 18 months to five years. It cautions that money market rates will likely change, making a long-term CD a potentially safer option for risk-averse savers. (not investment advice)</p>

The two socialized frequently in New York and Palm Beach, and Trump once praised Epstein as a "terrific guy."

Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not cutting rates, arguing high rates hurt the housing market. However, the Fed has maintained its stance, citing inflation risks exacerbated by the administration's tariff policies. Analysts suggest that a premature rate cut could reignite inflation, ultimately forcing the Fed to raise rates again, which would be counterproductive for consumers waiting for borrowing costs to ease.

Peroni, 27, was last seen with Sanfratello after a party, and her skull was found years later, but there was insufficient evidence to press charges at the time. The Josephine County Sheriff's Office reopened the cold case in 2024, using modern DNA evidence and re-interviewing witnesses to secure an indictment.
