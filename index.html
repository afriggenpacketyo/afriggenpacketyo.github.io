          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival and prompting a police investigation into possible arson. The outage affected approximately 160,000 households after a high-voltage line fell, hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes weakened the grid. Despite the disruption, Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed that all scheduled events, including the Palme d'Or ceremony, would proceed as planned using an independent power supply. Traffic lights were affected, causing traffic jams, and some shops remained closed until power was restored around 3 p.m. local time.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He criticized past foreign policy decisions involving military interventions and nation-building. Trump emphasized the administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs from military academies, highlighting the removal of critical race theory from the curriculum. He also claimed a new peacetime recruiting record, though data suggests enlistments began rebounding before his administration. Trump's address followed Vice President Vance's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, which emphasized a shift away from 'forever wars'.</p>

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that its aircraft struck "a number of suspects" operating from a structure near IDF troops in Khan Younis, adding that the claim of harm to civilians is under review. The United Nations Secretary-General has warned that people in Gaza are enduring what may be "the cruellest phase" of the war, denouncing Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul led England to a decisive victory over Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs in their one-off Test match. The off-spinner's performance at Trent Bridge broke Zimbabwe's resistance, dismissing them for 255 in their second innings. Despite England's win, their seam bowling was not entirely impressive on the third morning, and they collectively lacked penetration on a lifeless surface. Bashir's achievement made him the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets and the fourth to secure three five-wicket hauls before turning 22.</p>

Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down six missiles and 245 drones, while Russia claimed to have downed 94 drones over six regions.

          <p>CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson discussed their new book, 'Original Sin,' on Washington Week With The Atlantic, focusing on when Joe Biden began showing signs of cognitive decline. The book explores how some individuals questioned his fitness to serve as president. Tapper noted the emergence of a 'nonfunctioning Biden' with increasing frequency, raising concerns about his ability to fulfill his presidential duties. The discussion delves into the challenges and decisions made by those around Biden as his cognitive abilities appeared to wane.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a significant competitor in the sportswear market, reporting substantial sales growth driven by innovative products and strategic timing. Analysts suggest On's success stems from its unique shoe aesthetics and ability to capitalize on market shifts within Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas maintain a dominant market share, On's earnings growth has surpassed both companies in recent quarters. However, On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and tariff uncertainties, given its manufacturing concentration in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency (A&E) departments. The new clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed with specialists to treat acute mental distress. NHS England aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long waits in A&E. Critics emphasize the need for proper funding and testing of the model before national rollout.</p>

Aymond stated his concern for the survivors and his desire to expedite the negotiation process, acknowledging the bankruptcy has dragged on too long. Attorneys representing abuse claimants criticized the proposed settlement plan, with one calling it 'dead on arrival.' The proposed deal would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million more from insurance carriers and potential church property sales.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reports a record number of Americans applying for British citizenship or indefinite residency, the highest since 2004. The surge is attributed to the polarized political climate in the U.S., leading to increased inquiries from American immigration lawyers. While the UK government aims to reduce overall immigration, spousal or family links remain a primary eligibility pathway. Some politicians hint at potential exceptions to residency requirements based on individual contributions, alongside stricter language proficiency standards.</p>

She has since developed a C15:0 supplement for humans and authored a book, 'The Longevity Nutrient,' about her findings.
