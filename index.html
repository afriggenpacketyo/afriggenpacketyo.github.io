          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated the world faces a choice between 'peace or war' and 'dialogues or confrontation' during a large military parade in Beijing, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end. The event, attended by leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, showcased China's military might. Simultaneously, former U.S. President Donald Trump accused Beijing of conspiring against the U.S. with Russia and North Korea. Despite geopolitical tensions, the gathering did not appear to derail ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, with both sides seemingly favoring a deal in the coming months.</p>

          <p>England rugby player Abi Burton made her Rugby World Cup debut, marking a significant milestone after a challenging health battle. Three years prior, Burton was in a medically-induced coma for nearly four weeks due to autoimmune encephalitis, a rare condition where her immune system attacked her brain. She initially lost the ability to walk, talk, read, or write, but underwent intensive rehabilitation to return to elite sport. Her emotional debut, witnessed by her family, underscored a personal triumph far exceeding any match result.</p>

          <p>The UK's pharmaceutical industry is experiencing significant tension with the government over drug pricing rebates, threatening investment and growth. The latest Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG) saw a surprise hike in the rebate rate to 23%, far exceeding industry expectations. Pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca and Pfizer, warn this makes the UK 'uninvestable' and could divert research and development to other countries like the U.S. The dispute complicates the government's ambition to be a 'life sciences superpower' and impacts drug availability.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, aiming to rebound from recent negative sentiment driven by regional fiscal concerns. This follows a period where the U.K.'s 30-year bond yield reached its highest since 1998 and France's 30-year yield hit a 2009 peak, ahead of critical budget votes. Global bond yields have also been rising due to worries over President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and a U.S. court ruling on their legality. Investors are now assessing these factors, alongside upcoming earnings reports and economic data, to gauge market direction.</p>

His remarks came after the three leaders met in Beijing during a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II. Trump questioned whether Xi would acknowledge U.S. contributions to China's freedom during the conflict, while also extending 'warmest regards' to the leaders as they allegedly 'conspire against The United States of America.'

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The intense atmosphere of the US Open in New York has sparked a debate over on-court tennis etiquette, with incidents involving net cords, underarm serves, and body shots drawing scrutiny. Players like Jelena Ostapenko and Stefanos Tsitsipas have reacted strongly to perceived breaches of courtesy, such as opponents not apologizing for net-cord winners or using underarm serves. While some players, like Cameron Norrie, find a lack of apology for net cords inconsequential, the discussions highlight cultural differences in sportsmanship. The tournament's high stakes and vibrant crowd amplify these contentious moments, making etiquette a recurring talking point.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel ruled that President Donald Trump cannot use the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportations of individuals accused of membership in the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with immigrant rights lawyers, stating the act was not intended for such use during peacetime. This decision blocks a key administration initiative and is expected to proceed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final determination. The ruling emphasizes the historical context of the act, which has only been invoked during declared wars.</p>

Despite global uncertainties, the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and expressed optimism about avoiding extreme economic outcomes.

The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail criticized the police action, with calls for officers to focus on serious crime. Concurrently, financial reports indicate 'nervy bond markets' as Britain's long-term borrowing costs hit their highest levels since 1998. This economic concern, alongside a fall in the pound's value, is attributed to global factors and potential significant tax increases in the upcoming autumn Budget.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal, dealing a setback to his efforts to act as a national police chief. The ruling stated that the operation violated an 1878 law prohibiting the use of soldiers for civilian law enforcement activities. Trump had deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids, despite objections from local government officials.

          <p>A series of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure has severely damaged the country's crude refining capacity, leading to domestic fuel shortages and an export ban. Analysts estimate 15-20% of Russia's fuel production is now offline, causing queues at gas stations and depriving the Kremlin of crucial foreign currency. Western allies view this economic pressure as a key strategy to force President Putin to end the war, as sanctions and limited Western technical support make repairs increasingly difficult.

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published an op-ed condemning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership, accusing him of 'endangering every American's health.' Their strong criticism follows the controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the resignations of other top officials. The former directors, who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, cited decisions such as canceling medical research investments and altering vaccine advisory committees. They called on Congress to exercise oversight, expressing deep concern that politics and ideology are overshadowing public health and science.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested he plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago, stating, 'We're going in,' as part of his controversial initiative to use federal forces to address crime. This potential deployment follows similar actions in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, despite a recent court ruling against the LA deployment. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker strongly condemned Trump's comments as 'unhinged' and vowed to fight any troop deployment in court. Trump characterized Chicago as a 'mess' with an 'incompetent mayor,' asserting his right to intervene to protect the country.</p>

          <p>A jury swiftly ruled in favor of Cardi B, finding her not liable in a lawsuit filed by a security guard who alleged the rapper assaulted her. Emani Ellis claimed Cardi B cut her face with a fingernail and spat on her during a heated argument at an obstetrician's office in 2018, while Cardi B's pregnancy was still a secret. Cardi B testified that she feared Ellis would leak her pregnancy news, admitting to an argument but denying any physical contact. The jury deliberated for approximately one hour before clearing the Grammy-winning artist of all allegations.</p>

          <p>Google received a partial victory in a landmark antitrust case, as a federal judge ruled against the most severe penalties proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite Google being found to illegally hold a monopoly in internet search, the judge allowed the company to retain its Chrome browser. The decision was significantly influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI technologies like ChatGPT, which has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape. The ruling mandates Google share search data and prevents it from using anticompetitive tactics for its AI products, aiming to foster competition in this evolving market.</p>

          <p>Protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers are placing UK police forces under 'chronic pressure,' exacerbating their duties this summer. Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, expressed concern about political and business leaders potentially spreading misinformation on social media, which fuels division. With over 3,000 protests recorded since June, many involving pro and anti-migrant groups, police resources are strained. Stephens urged leaders to reduce tension and emphasized that better integration of refugees could alleviate the demand on policing, advocating for a long-term strategy to cope with modern challenges.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court reinstated Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, rejecting President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from office. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of clear legal precedent. This decision upholds the independence of regulatory agencies and challenges the president's power to dismiss officials at will. Slaughter expressed eagerness to resume her work, while the White House did not immediately comment on the ruling, which is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
