          <p>Guinea is holding a referendum on a new constitution that could permit its military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, to run for president. The proposed changes are controversial as they also extend presidential terms and create barriers for political parties. Major opposition leaders have called for a boycott, citing a crackdown on dissent that has stifled public debate and left the "no" campaign almost non-existent. This event occurs amidst a broader trend of military takeovers in West Africa, where new leaders are distancing themselves from former colonial powers like France.</p>

The goal is to boost productivity, modernize industries, and enhance governance, positioning AI as the central engine for future growth. The directive sets ambitious targets, aiming for 70% AI penetration in key sectors by 2027 and a fully AI-powered economy by 2035. This policy also reflects China's ambition to shape global AI development by making its tools available to countries in the Global South, aiming to bridge the global intelligence divide.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in a septic tank in Kenya, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national in connection with her murder. Wanjiru was last seen leaving a bar with British soldiers in March 2012, and a 2019 inquest concluded she was killed by one or two soldiers. The case has drawn renewed attention following reports of misconduct at the British Army base in Nanyuki. If an extradition occurs, it would mark the first time a British soldier is sent abroad to face trial for the murder of a civilian.</p>

          <p>British 1500m Olympic bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell has decided to focus on the 800m at the World Championships in Tokyo, setting up a potential showdown with her training partner, Keely Hodgkinson. After quitting the sport for five years, Hunter Bell has made a remarkable comeback and is now a full-time athlete, showing significant promise in the two-lap event this season. She consulted with Dame Kelly Holmes before making the difficult decision, ultimately opting against a risky 800m and 1500m double. Hunter Bell expressed excitement about the possibility of Great Britain securing two medals in the event.</p>

          <h2>Cyberattack on Aviation Software Causes Widespread Disruption at European Airports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 03:47:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace's 'Muse' software has caused significant disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Dublin. The software, which manages check-in and baggage systems for multiple airlines, failed on Saturday, forcing airport staff to resort to manual processes like pen and paper, leading to long queues and hundreds of flight delays. Brussels Airport has canceled half of its departing flights, and it remains unclear when the system will be fully restored. The incident highlights the increasing vulnerability of the aviation industry's critical digital infrastructure to cyber-related threats.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent Premier League matches reveals that top teams like Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating long-ball and direct-attack strategies, a departure from their traditional possession-based styles. This tactical shift is a response to the effectiveness of coordinated high-pressing defenses, which make building up play from the back riskier. By using long goal-kicks to target tall forwards and launching quick counter-attacks, managers like Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are adding unpredictability to their play. This evolution demonstrates a pragmatic adaptation to nullify opponents' strengths and exploit transitional moments in the game.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed his former personal lawyer, Lindsey Halligan, as the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The appointment follows a public post in which Trump criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi and demanded more aggressive investigations into his political opponents, such as former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James. The previous US attorney for the district resigned after concluding there was insufficient evidence to prosecute James, a case Trump had pushed for. The move has heightened concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean and is gradually strengthening. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is forecast to become a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for the next several days, passing east of Bermuda without making landfall. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for any land areas, distant swells from the system are expected to reach the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada early next week.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover Recent Landslides on the Moon Triggered by Moonquakes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 00:00:13 EDT</div>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has discovered evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, a finding that challenges the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. By comparing high-resolution images taken over several years, the scientists identified 41 new landslides that have occurred since 2009, likely triggered by shallow moonquakes. This discovery has significant implications for future lunar exploration and the establishment of permanent bases, as it suggests that seismic activity could pose a potential hazard to infrastructure and personnel on the lunar surface.</p>

          <h2>California Enacts New Laws to Restrict Federal Immigration Enforcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:22:48 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at protecting residents from federal immigration enforcement, which he referred to as the actions of "secret police." The most prominent new law, the 'No Secret Police Act,' will ban federal and local law enforcement officers, including ICE agents, from wearing face coverings while on duty in the state and require them to be identifiable by name and badge. Other laws in the package restrict immigration enforcement activities at schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant. The legislation represents a direct challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn of Alarming Northward Shift in Great White Shark Behavior</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine biologists are observing an alarming shift in great white shark behavior, with sightings increasing significantly in northern New England waters, including off the coasts of Maine and Canada. This northward expansion is believed to be driven by rising ocean temperatures, which are pushing the sharks' traditional nursery grounds, and a growing seal population which serves as their prey. While attacks remain rare, experts are urging the public to be cautious, as local communities are not accustomed to the presence of these predators. The trend highlights a tangible consequence of climate change on marine ecosystems.</p>
