          <p>HSBC's co-CEO, David Liao Yi-chien, stated that multinational companies are increasing their investments in China's high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and consumer goods sectors, reflecting optimism about China's innovation and growth potential. According to HSBC's Global Trade Pulse Survey, China is the top target market for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities, with many planning to increase manufacturing in the country. China continues to attract international investment due to its vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent. Liao emphasized that China's capital markets provide essential investment opportunities for international investors, driven by innovation-led economic growth.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Japan's leader, analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to view Beijing as a strategic competitor, navigating the complex China-Japan relationship. The previous leader cited the conclusion of trade negotiations with the United States, which reduced tariffs on Japanese car imports, as his reason for stepping down. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on the resignation, calling it an internal matter for Japan. The new leader will need to manage the ongoing tensions and strategic competition between the two countries, which has been a persistent challenge in recent years.</p>

          <p>Mistral AI, backed by Nvidia, has achieved a valuation of $14 billion in a Series C funding round, with ASML, a Dutch chip equipment maker, securing a significant stake in the French company. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros in Mistral AI's 1.7 billion-euro funding round, gaining an 11% shareholding. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros, driven by substantial investments in the rapidly growing AI industry. Mistral, a leading European tech startup and OpenAI rival, is developing large language models for AI applications like chatbots, requiring significant infrastructure investments, with the company launching its first reasoning model to compete with OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has called on BRICS members to address trade imbalances with New Delhi, as the bloc collectively opposes U.S. tariffs. India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar noted that India's largest trade deficits are with BRICS partners. This stance contrasts with Brazil's criticism of the U.S., while China cautioned against unilateralism and protectionism, urging BRICS nations to unite against higher tariffs. India views BRICS primarily as an economic initiative, while China and Russia consider it a geopolitical grouping, with India's trade deficit with China reaching a record high, prompting calls for solutions to address these imbalances. The tone suggests a complex dynamic within BRICS regarding trade and geopolitical strategy.</p>

          <p>European stocks are expected to remain steady or decline as investors focus on political instability in France following the ousting of Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, creating uncertainty in the region. Bayrou's government lost a confidence vote due to a lack of support for the 2026 budget plans aimed at reducing France's budget deficit, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new prime minister. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher, and U.S. stock futures remained relatively unchanged as investors await key inflation reports, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. This week's inflation data follows weaker-than-expected hiring data, fueling hopes for potential interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>Nepal has lifted a social media ban that sparked protests and clashes with police, resulting in at least 19 deaths and over 100 injuries. The ban was implemented after a "nepo kid" campaign gained traction on social media, highlighting the lifestyles of politicians' children and allegations of corruption. Protests erupted when the government blocked 26 social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, leading to thousands of young people storming parliament in Kathmandu. The government reversed the ban after an emergency meeting to address the demands of Gen Z, with Prime Minister Oli expressing sadness over the violence and promising an investigation.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions related to graft and abuse of power. The court investigated the handling of Thaksin's return to Thailand in 2023 and determined that his previous detention in a police hospital did not count as serving prison time. Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, expressed concern for her father but affirmed his continued role as a spiritual leader in Thai politics. Following the ruling, Thaksin is expected to be sent to Bangkok Remand Prison, marking another chapter in the political saga surrounding the Shinawatra family.</p>

          <p>Thailand's top court has mandated that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra serve a year in jail, adding to the challenges faced by the influential political family. The decision stems from a previous corruption case where he received a prison sentence but spent minimal time in a jail cell before being transferred to a hospital. The Supreme Court deemed this transfer unlawful, requiring the 76-year-old to serve his sentence in jail. Thaksin's daughter, Paetongtarn, who previously served as leader but was removed from office due to a leaked phone call, was present at the ruling, with the case sparking criticism about privileged treatment for the wealthy and powerful.</p>

          <p>The resignation of Angela Rayner has created a vacancy for the deputy leader of the Labour Party, a position directly elected by party members. The contest coincides with a government reshuffle seen as tilting to the Right, raising concerns among some on the party's Left. The party's general secretary has emphasized the importance of serving the country during the contest, while some within the party suggest abolishing the post altogether. The outcome of the election will indicate the direction of the Labour Party and the level of internal dissent.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch voiced concerns that the UK might need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) if the government fails to deliver a plan for economic growth. She offered to work with Prime Minister Starmer to cut welfare spending, citing the need to avoid a "doom loop" of rising taxes and precarious public finances. Badenoch pointed to rising UK borrowing costs and a crisis in bond prices as indicators of economic instability. She emphasized the need for a growth plan and criticized Labour's approach, suggesting that the country could face a crisis without decisive action.</p>

          <p>Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals negotiated by President Trump, with countries often announcing large orders for Boeing jets after striking agreements with the U.S. These deals allow countries to demonstrate their commitment to reducing trade surpluses with the U.S. and come with the advantage of spanning years, delaying financial strain. Despite safety scandals, Boeing's role in these deals underscores its symbolic weight as an iconic American company and the limited options in the aircraft manufacturing industry. These orders support the growing international tourism industry.</p>
