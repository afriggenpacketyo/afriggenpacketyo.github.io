          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that could significantly consolidate the media landscape. The potential merger would combine major assets like CBS, Paramount+, CNN, and HBO, along with extensive film libraries and sports rights, creating a media giant. This development comes as the industry grapples with the shift to streaming, with shares of Warner Bros. Discovery surging over 25% following the news. The bid could be presented as early as next week, signaling a potential new wave of media consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell by 7% after a record-setting rally, driven by concerns that its recent massive backlog growth is almost entirely from a single client, OpenAI. The company had projected a fourteen-fold expansion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030, causing its stock to surge nearly 36%. However, a subsequent report revealed that OpenAI is expected to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years, tempering investor enthusiasm. Analysts now express caution about the company's heavy reliance on one customer for its future growth projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A majority of justices on a Brazilian Supreme Court panel have voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting to orchestrate a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The ruling found him guilty on multiple counts, including leading a criminal organization, and he could face a prison sentence of several decades. The trial has highlighted deep political divisions within Brazil and has drawn international attention, particularly from the U.S. government. Bolsonaro, who denies the charges, is expected to appeal the verdict to the full 11-justice court.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has triggered a wave of grief and intense anger across social media, with many conservative influencers and politicians immediately blaming left-wing rhetoric for the violence. Figures like Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro mourned Kirk as a martyr, while others, including President Trump, asserted that years of political demonization were directly responsible for the attack. Despite the lack of information about the shooter's identity or motive, the narrative of a politically motivated killing from the left quickly took hold. This reaction highlights the nation's deep political polarization and raises concerns about potential retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>Federal health data indicates a high number of West Nile virus cases across the United States this year, with at least 771 human cases reported in 39 states as of early September.

Analysts suggest the drone incident was a deliberate Russian probe designed to test NATO's response and sow division within the alliance.

Conversely, prominent chefs like Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller argue that nonstick coatings like Teflon are safe when used correctly and that a ban could make home cooking more difficult and expensive.

It argues that while a full-scale civil war remains unlikely, the current environment of dehumanizing language and targeted attacks is exceedingly dangerous.

          <h2>New Inflation Data Shows Trump's Tariffs Are Increasingly Impacting Consumer Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent federal inflation data indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising costs for a range of consumer goods, including apparel, electronics, and groceries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report for August showed price increases in several tariff-sensitive categories, creating a "middle-class squeeze" at a time when the labor market is showing signs of weakness. While President Trump has insisted tariffs would not drive inflation, the data suggests otherwise, presenting a complex challenge for the Federal Reserve. Economists note the situation could worsen as more costs are passed on to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients could see a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026, according to preliminary estimates based on the latest inflation data. This would represent a modest increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025, raising the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated. While an improvement, the projected increase comes as retirees express concern over rising costs for essentials like Medicare and the potential for new tariffs to further erode their purchasing power.

          <p>A significant rise in healthcare inflation is driving up coverage costs, with large employers projecting an average 9% increase in their health spending for 2026, the highest jump in 15 years. August's Consumer Price Index showed medical care costs rising 4.2% annually, outpacing the overall inflation rate. Key drivers include the high cost of prescription drugs, particularly for cancer and obesity, as well as increased prices for hospital services. While companies are hesitant to pass these costs to employees, many are considering it as a last resort, signaling higher premiums for workers next year. (not investment advice)</p>

The raid targeted a facility under construction on the Hyundai auto plant campus, a major economic project for the state. The incident has caused diplomatic friction, with South Korea's president calling for improvements to the U.S. visa system and noting that President Trump personally intervened to halt the deportation process temporarily.

          <p>California lawmakers are debating a controversial bill that would expand confidentiality for police officers' records, a move critics argue would undermine recent transparency laws. The proposed legislation, AB 1178, could exempt records from public disclosure for any officer who has recently worked undercover, received a death threat, or been assigned to a task force. While proponents, including police unions, argue the measures are necessary for officer safety, press advocates and reform groups contend it would gut public accountability. The debate highlights the ongoing struggle between police privacy and the public's right to access information about misconduct.</p>

Routh is charged with positioning himself with a rifle near Trump's golf course in a planned ambush. In his opening statement, which was cut short by the judge for being irrelevant, Routh made a series of vague philosophical statements. The prosecution argued that Routh's plot was "carefully crafted and deadly serious," intended to take the electoral choice away from American voters. A former Secret Service agent testified about confronting Routh, whom he identified in court.</p>
