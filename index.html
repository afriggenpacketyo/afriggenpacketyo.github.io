        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Portugal's recent snap elections saw the center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) emerge victorious, but the far-right Chega party made significant gains, disrupting the country's traditional bipartisan dominance. The AD secured just under a third of the votes, winning 89 of the 230 seats in the National Assembly, while Chega tied with the Socialists at 58 seats. The outcome reflects a broader rightward trend across Europe, similar to recent polls in Germany. The future of Portugal's government remains uncertain, with a minority AD government seeming most likely, though there are increasing calls for cooperation between the center-left and center-right parties to ensure stability. </p>

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and concerns over the Republican fiscal plan, has amplified existing divisions within the Republican party. Fiscally conservative Republicans are leveraging the downgrade to demand deeper cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and food assistance, while moderate Republicans fear that such cuts could jeopardize their congressional majority. The Republican plan, as written, is projected to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, further fueling the debate. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky has used the Moody‚Äôs rating change to reinforce his position, arguing that the bill would only make ‚Äúbond buyers realize we aren‚Äôt fiscally responsible.‚Äù</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 18:46:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement that former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, oncology experts have weighed in on why the diagnosis may have come at a later stage. They suggest that it is not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced, particularly given the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older. It's also possible that the cancer developed rapidly between screenings or that initial screening results were borderline, leading to a decision not to pursue further testing. Some patients may not exhibit symptoms even with advanced prostate cancer, making early detection challenging.</p>

          <p>Following a two-hour phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, conflicting views have emerged regarding potential peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. While Trump expressed optimism that negotiations for a ceasefire would commence immediately, Putin emphasized that any resolution would need to address the "root causes" of the war, including Ukraine's desire for closer ties to Europe. Trump suggested that the Pope could potentially assist in the negotiations, but also indicated that the U.S. might withdraw from the negotiating table if progress is not made. Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy expressed concern that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace.</p>

While the GSA did not list a price, commercial property brokers estimate it could sell for around $60 million.

          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts have provided information about the disease, including its signs, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in American men, and while early prostate cancer generally does not cause symptoms, advanced stages can lead to problems with urination, erectile dysfunction, and pain. Screening tests, such as PSA tests and digital rectal exams, can help detect prostate cancer early, increasing the odds of successful treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the cancer and how far it has spread, and can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles, heavily reliant on trade with China, is preparing for the impact of new tariffs following a 90-day truce. While April saw a boost in container units moved, the port's executive director, Gene Seroka, attributes this to importers rushing to get cargo in before tariffs take effect. Despite a 5% increase in imports, exports fell by 3% year-on-year, highlighting the uncertainty caused by the ongoing US-China trade tensions. The port's business is nearly 45% dependent on China.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, reflecting concerns about rising government debt. This marks the first time since April 11 that the average 30-year mortgage rate has surpassed this threshold. While the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, mortgage rates remain high due to their link to the 10-year Treasury bond. The elevated rates, coupled with a shortage of affordable properties, are creating challenges for aspiring homebuyers, with only a small fraction of listed homes being affordable for households with moderate incomes.

This dependency has the potential to cripple advanced manufacturing in the US, as rare earth materials are essential for producing various high-tech products, including smartphones and fighter jets.
