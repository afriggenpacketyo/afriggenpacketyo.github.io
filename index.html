          <p>A fireworks display at the Rheinkirmes fair in Düsseldorf, Germany, resulted in 19 injuries, four of them serious, after rockets exploded too close to the crowd. Eyewitnesses reported that some rockets flew sideways or detonated at an unusually low altitude, with at least one child among the injured. The event was ended early to prevent panic, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the malfunction. The article also notes a separate warning from the German Red Cross about a lack of emergency preparedness skills among the population.</p>

This backing, which includes significant funding subject to partner contributions, is seen as a major boost for UK Athletics. The decision follows an open letter from over 100 British athletes urging support, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer highlighting the potential for national pride, economic benefits, and inspiring the next generation of athletes. The government is also supporting a bid for the 2029 World Para Athletics Championships.</p>

          <p>Edwin J. Feulner, the co-founder and long-serving former president of the Heritage Foundation, has passed away at the age of 83. He is credited with transforming the conservative think tank from an obscure organization into a major policy influencer in Washington, D.C., particularly during the Reagan era. Feulner remained an active figure in the movement, contributing to initiatives like Project 2025 and serving on Donald Trump's transition team. The Heritage Foundation praised him as a visionary and patriot, though his cause of death was not disclosed.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is set to face its rival, the LA Galaxy, in a highly anticipated derby match, seeking to rebound after a disappointing performance in the Club World Cup. Despite recent league wins, LAFC views this "El Tráfico" classic as a crucial opportunity to win back fan support. Coach Steve Cherundolo acknowledges the team's poor form in the international tournament but emphasizes that in a rivalry game, current standings and statistics are irrelevant. The match occurs amidst protests from Galaxy supporter groups over non-soccer related issues.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a significantly cheaper and more accessible method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The new technique allows for the production of anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body using gene therapy tools, bypassing the expensive and complex conventional process. This breakthrough, detailed in The Lancet, was successfully used to treat four patients with multiple myeloma.

Despite government incentives, many Italians find the support insufficient to offset the challenges of high childcare costs and career pressures.

          <p>Beijing's top disciplinary body is highlighting a failed tourism project, the "Yaohan Longevity City," as a prime example of grass-roots government mismanagement and wasteful spending. The ambitious project in Guilin was intended to be a health tourism hub but was left largely abandoned due to a broken capital chain and poor decision-making. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) condemned the project as a "severe waste of resources" and is using the case as a public warning to other local cadres across China, expelling the official who backed it.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Army Scientists Propose More Powerful 'Super X-Railgun' Design</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 23:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists from the People's Liberation Army's engineering university have proposed a new "super X-railgun" design that could nearly double the power of the navy's existing electromagnetic weapon. The current naval railgun, a global first, is reportedly limited by its inability to fire projectiles heavy enough for major naval warfare. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which researchers claim would allow it to fire a 30kg shell at Mach 7, significantly enhancing its military application. This development aims to overcome the power limitations that have previously hampered the weapon's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency has reported a 60% increase in serious water pollution incidents by water companies in England in a single year, reaching a record high. Of the 2,801 total incidents in 2024, 75 were deemed to cause serious or persistent harm to the environment and human health. A cross-party parliamentary committee described the situation as "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action." The data comes ahead of a major review of the water industry, with speculation that it may recommend scrapping the regulator, Ofwat.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated it will facilitate the return of former Venezuelan detainees from El Salvador's CECOT prison to the U.S. if required for legal proceedings. This assurance was part of negotiations with the Maduro regime that led to the release of over 250 Venezuelan migrants from the controversial prison in exchange for American prisoners. An ICE official stated that while the release decision was made by El Salvador, the U.S. secured a promise from Venezuela not to obstruct the travel of any former detainee needed for a U.S. court appearance.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, support the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. This enthusiasm is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that an overwhelming majority still view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. Furthermore, the public generally believes the space program provides technological benefits, with support for space exploration cutting across party lines.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are challenging the dominance of U.S. companies such as OpenAI and Google by championing open-source artificial intelligence models. Unlike the closed, proprietary systems common in Silicon Valley, these Chinese companies are making their source code and model weights publicly available, fostering global collaboration and innovation. The recent launch of powerful free-to-use models from China has been influential, creating a viable alternative for developers worldwide and redefining the competitive landscape. This trend is unleashing a wave of new AI applications.</p>

          <p>The CEO of U.S. tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a woman at a Coldplay concert went viral. The clip, which showed the pair abruptly hiding their faces when they appeared on the stadium's large screen, sparked widespread online speculation about an affair. In response to the internet frenzy, Astronomer's board announced it has initiated a formal investigation into the matter. The woman in the video was rumored to be another company executive, though the firm's statement said no other employees were involved.</p>

          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is critically understaffed, hindering its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. The audit found a high vacancy rate, leading to the agency closing complaint and accident cases without proper on-site inspections. When inspections were conducted, they often lacked sufficient documentation, and fines were sometimes reduced without clear justification. Cal/OSHA stated it is working to improve operations, but workplace safety experts argue the chronic understaffing puts workers at significant risk.</p>
