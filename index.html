          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with sales growing 13% year-over-year. The company's advertising business was a notable success, showing 23% growth, and its AWS cloud unit also saw an 18% revenue increase. However, investor confidence was shaken by a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter, causing the stock to decline in after-hours trading. This cautious guidance comes as Amazon continues to make substantial investments in artificial intelligence and faces stiff competition in the cloud computing sector.</p>

The Mac business saw the fastest growth at nearly 15%, while the services division also continued its strong performance.

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under the Biden administration, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The decision by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll followed social media posts from a pro-Trump activist who accused Easterly of undermining the Trump administration. Easterly described the reversal as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." This incident follows a pattern of dismissals influenced by similar online campaigns, raising concerns about political influence over military and academic appointments.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and narrowly beating analyst estimates. Despite leading the cloud infrastructure market, AWS faces intensifying pressure from rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, which reported higher growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively. AWS remains a significant profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income for the quarter.

          <p>In recent comments, President Trump described Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine as a "disgrace" and expressed sadness over the high number of Russian casualties, while also labeling it "Biden's war." He confirmed his intention to impose sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire is not brokered soon, although he voiced skepticism about their effectiveness on Vladimir Putin. Separately, when questioned about the Jeffrey Epstein case, Trump stated he was unaware of why Epstein was hiring young women from his Mar-a-Lago club but reiterated that he had Epstein removed from the premises upon learning about it.</p>

          <p>For individuals who have saved a substantial amount like $20,000, choosing the right account to maximize growth is crucial in the current high-interest-rate environment. This article compares the earning potential of high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. Based on current average rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.44% APY would earn slightly more over a year than a money market account at 4.32% APY. However, the difference is minimal, and the best choice may depend on other factors, such as a money market account's check-writing capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that recent changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act could create significant financial barriers for students pursuing professional degrees in fields like law and medicine. The new law caps federal loans for professional students at $50,000 per year, which is often insufficient to cover the high tuition and living costs at institutions like the University of California. The author suggests this will disproportionately affect working-class students and calls on the state of California to create its own loan programs to bridge the funding gap and ensure a steady supply of essential professionals.</p>

          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" franchise effectively captures the silly and creative humor of the original films, offering a largely successful and hilarious comedic experience. Liam Neeson gives a surprisingly entertaining performance as Frank Drebin Jr., the son of the original protagonist, mastering the deadpan delivery and slapstick comedy required for the role. While the script plays it safe by closely following the established formula, it provides a welcome dose of irreverent fun. The article also briefly reviews other new releases, including the horror film "Together" and the thriller "She Rides Shotgun."</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, significantly drawing down the force sent by the Trump administration to manage protests against federal immigration raids. Approximately 250 troops will remain to protect federal property and personnel. The initial deployment of 5,000 military members was met with strong opposition from California politicians, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued it was an overreach and diverted resources from other state needs. The withdrawal has been praised by local leaders, who are pushing for a complete demobilization.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reversed a contentious law that would have curtailed the independence of key anti-corruption agencies, following nearly a week of large-scale public protests. The demonstrations, the largest since Russia's full-scale invasion, were led by young Ukrainians who feared the law would jeopardize the country's path toward EU integration. The swift U-turn by the government highlights the power of civil society in Ukraine. However, the crisis has raised questions about the administration's commitment to anti-corruption reforms, which are crucial for maintaining Western financial support.</p>

          <p>Shares of Coinbase declined after the cryptocurrency exchange reported second-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion, which fell short of analyst estimates. While the company's net income saw a significant rise due to gains on its crypto investments, weaker-than-expected transaction revenue and retail trading volume concerned investors. A slowdown in speculative trading by retail investors contributed to the disappointing results. However, revenue from subscriptions and services, including stablecoins, showed growth, though it also missed projections, indicating a mixed financial performance for the quarter.</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for governor of California, former Vice President Kamala Harris has numerous options for her next chapter. Experts suggest she is likely to remain in the public eye, potentially preparing for another presidential run in 2028, starting a foundation, or championing a specific cause like artificial intelligence. To remain politically relevant, she will need to reshape her public narrative following the 2024 election loss. Her next steps will likely involve reconnecting with the American public and helping to elect other Democrats while carefully navigating a divided party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, Merck, and Eli Lilly, demanding they take steps to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. within 60 days. He threatened to use every available tool to combat "abusive drug pricing" if they do not comply by a September 29 deadline. The president is calling for companies to offer drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price available in other developed nations and to ensure new drugs are launched at these prices. This move revives his "most favored nation" policy aimed at curbing high U.S. drug costs.</p>
