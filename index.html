          <p>A 20-year-old man, Wess Roley, has been identified as the suspect who ambushed firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring a third. Authorities believe Roley intentionally started a wildfire to lure the first responders to the remote location before opening fire with a shotgun. The suspect was later found deceased at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, and investigators are still working to determine a clear motive for the attack. The two fallen firefighters were identified as Battalion Chiefs Frank Harwood and John Morrison.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has reportedly been offered a plea deal to avoid the death penalty. The family of victim Kaylee Goncalves confirmed the development and expressed their fury with the Latah County Prosecutor's Office, stating they felt failed by the state. The proposed deal comes just weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, which had been moved to Boise over concerns about securing a fair trial in the original county.

          <p>The UK's Labour government is confronting a significant internal rebellion over its proposed changes to welfare benefits, particularly the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration is engaged in a major effort to persuade dozens of its own MPs who are opposed to the reforms. Critics within the party argue the changes are being rushed and will harm vulnerable people, while leadership insists they are necessary for the long-term stability of the welfare system. The contentious vote highlights deep ideological divisions within the party just one year into its term.</p>

          <p>Dozens of demonstrators were arrested by U.S. Capitol Police during protests against a major Republican-led tax and spending cut bill. The protests occurred in the Capitol rotunda and at a nearby intersection, with participants carrying signs and symbolic coffins to decry proposed cuts to programs like SNAP and Medicaid. The demonstrations, organized by groups including the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign, aimed to highlight the potential impact of the legislation on vulnerable populations in various states.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered a "vote-a-rama," a marathon session of amendment votes, on President Trump's signature domestic policy bill, as Republicans push to pass the legislation by July 4.

Democrats are using the session to force votes on controversial aspects of the bill, while GOP leadership works to secure support from a few remaining holdouts.

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents organ inflammation and aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. This finding provides a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the health benefits of physical activity. It also suggests potential for future anti-aging strategies that could simulate the positive effects of exercise on the body.</p>

This shift has created a new US$42 billion industry.

The article profiles service members like Maj. Kara Corcoran and Lt. Rae Timberlake, who now face potential involuntary separation from their long-term careers despite decorated service records. The ban has been criticized as discriminatory and is being challenged legally, but for now, affected troops are described as being in "survival mode."</p>

          <p>A sweeping Republican budget bill is causing anxiety for many Americans who rely on programs targeted for cuts or changes. The legislation proposes significant reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and new work requirements for Medicaid, which could affect millions of low-income individuals and people with disabilities. The article profiles citizens who fear losing vital food and health benefits. Conversely, the bill's proposal to eliminate federal income tax on tips and overtime has been met with excitement by some workers, such as firefighters, who anticipate substantial savings.

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 of those troops to California's state command. The request comes as the state's specialized wildfire-fighting Guard unit is reportedly at just 40% of its regular staffing level with fire season underway. These troops had been federalized and deployed in response to immigration-related protests. California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization, praised the request, urging the president to "stop the political theater" and return the troops to their critical firefighting duties.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by backing companies with bold, forward-looking ideas rather than established blue-chip stocks. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and Palantir, which are seen as innovative, while penalizing firms like Apple for what they perceive as a lack of new ideas. This shift has created an "idea market" focused on the potential of individual company stories and growth, rather than one dominated by institutional hedge funds reacting to Federal Reserve moves.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that practical and logistical obstacles are a primary cause of falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK, more so than vaccine hesitancy. Difficulties in booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders are preventing many parents from getting their children vaccinated on schedule. This decline has led to recent outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. The report calls for investment in more accessible vaccination services, including better use of NHS apps and expanding the role of health visitors.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s divisive tenure as the U.S. health secretary, where he has launched a mission to tackle chronic disease while also promoting controversial and unfounded health theories. He has targeted food additives and supported bans on junk food purchases with welfare benefits, moves that have some support. However, his long-standing vaccine skepticism, which has led to the dismissal of an expert advisory committee and new research into discredited vaccine-autism links, has drawn fierce criticism from the scientific community. His approach is portrayed as a mix of ambitious public health goals and dangerous misinformation.</p>

Jassy also discussed artificial intelligence, calling generative AI the "most transformative technology of our lifetime" and confirming Amazon's commitment to leaning into it.

          <p>Starting in July, energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% under the latest price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts caution that prices are unlikely to drop significantly more and may rise again, with bills remaining hundreds of pounds higher than pre-pandemic levels. With ongoing uncertainty in global markets, consumers are being encouraged to shop for fixed-rate deals to provide more stability over their energy costs for the upcoming winter.
