He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and poses the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals.

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's tariffs can remain in place until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked the tariffs.

The ruling extends the legal battle over the legality of the tariffs, which have faced criticism from businesses and state governments. The tariffs, imposed on imports from various countries, have been justified by Trump as necessary to address trade imbalances. </p>
