          <h2>UK Parliamentarians Push for Further Reforms to Lifetime ISA Program</h2>

          <p>The UK's Treasury Committee has warned that government reforms to the Lifetime ISA (LISA) program do not go far enough, urging more substantial changes in the upcoming Budget. MPs raised concerns that the product, designed to help save for a first home or retirement, is often mis-sold and has rules that unfairly penalize benefit claimants. The committee also questioned whether the LISA represents a good use of taxpayer money, as research suggests most users could have bought a home without it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Study 'Dark DNA' of Peacock Spiders to Understand Biodiversity</h2>

          <p>Researchers are investigating Australia's peacock spiders, which have over 100 distinct species, to understand the mechanics of their extraordinary diversity. Scientists hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA"—the vast portions of the genetic code that do not consist of genes. They believe this mysterious DNA could enable the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly, offering broader insights into how variation is generated across the natural world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Security experts are expressing growing concern over the strengthening relationships between China, Russia, North Korea, and India, viewing it as the potential formation of an "anti-Western alliance." Recent high-profile meetings between the leaders of these nations are seen by some analysts as a shift by Beijing to actively pursue a new world order based on military strength and repressive regimes. While not a formal military pact, this functional partnership is seen as a significant challenge to the current global power structure.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 was not among the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States in 2024. This marks the first time the disease has dropped from the list since the pandemic began, when it quickly became the third leading cause of death. The data reflects a steady decline in COVID fatalities and a broader 4% decrease in overall deaths last year, with heart disease and cancer remaining the top two causes.</p>

          <p>In a close 51-49 vote, Senate Republicans defeated a Democratic amendment that would have forced the public release of investigative files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein. Democrats attached the measure to the annual defense authorization bill in a procedural move to compel a vote on the issue. Despite two Republicans crossing party lines to support the disclosure, the effort failed, continuing the political stalemate over the transparency of the high-profile sex trafficking investigation.</p>

          <p>A phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly heated following Israel's airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. According to senior administration officials, President Trump conveyed that the decision to conduct a strike within the territory of Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator, was not a wise one. The exchange highlights the diplomatic friction created by the attack, which has been widely condemned for jeopardizing regional stability and peace negotiations.</p>
