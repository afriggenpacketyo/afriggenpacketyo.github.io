          <p>China Vanke, a debt-laden property developer, has obtained a 1.55 billion yuan (US$215.4 million) loan from state-owned Shenzhen Metro Group, its largest shareholder, to alleviate financial strain. The loan aims to assist Vanke in meeting its US$3.4 billion debt obligations for the year. Shenzhen Metro has already provided Vanke with loans totaling 10.3 billion yuan this year, following a government-led shake-up in February that saw the appointment of new executives. Despite this financial support, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Vanke's bonds further into junk territory, highlighting ongoing concerns in the financial markets.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention following a judge's ruling that his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of spreading Hamas propaganda and having ties to terrorism, claims the judge refuted, stating there was no evidence of statements supporting Hamas. Suri's lawyers argued he was targeted for speech in support of Palestinian rights and family ties to Gaza. Despite the release, the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings, raising concerns about the targeting of academics and students advocating for Palestinian rights.</p>

          <p>China-Philippine ties face uncertainty as President Marcos' efforts to undermine the Duterte camp have been unsuccessful, with Duterte likely to survive an impeachment trial. Observers suggest Duterte, with her pragmatic stance on China, could become a strong presidential candidate in 2028, potentially improving relations between the two countries. Despite accusations of misusing public funds, Duterte appears to have enough support to avoid conviction, preserving her eligibility for the 2028 race. Qi Huaigao, a professor at Fudan University, noted Marcos' failure to eliminate the Duterte political dynasty, indicating a potential shift in diplomatic strategy depending on future election outcomes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri's near-complete abortion ban could potentially return if a new ballot measure, recently passed by the state legislature, gains voter approval. The GOP-controlled Missouri Senate passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would repeal an earlier amendment passed by voters last year, which enshrined abortion protections in the state's constitution. The proposed amendment will appear on the state's ballots in the 2026 general election, but could be voted on sooner if the Republican governor calls a special election. If passed, the new measure would include exceptions for sexual assault and incest, marking another chapter in the ongoing legal and political battle over abortion rights in Missouri.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's increasingly hostile approach to South Africa is shaped by a convergence of factors, including meetings with Afrikaner activists, a break over Israel's war in Gaza, and a focus on eradicating diversity and inclusion programs. Trump's views on white farmers in South Africa, influenced by conversations with golfer Gary Player and amplified by media figures like Tucker Carlson, have driven policy decisions such as halting foreign aid and prioritizing Afrikaner refugees. The administration's actions reflect a broader agenda influenced by white victimhood narratives, leading to diplomatic tensions and accusations of racism.

          <p>While the US President Donald Trump has said that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a "genocide", this is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited. Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race. Some Afrikaners express pride in their heritage and commitment to South Africa, while others feel persecuted and seek refuge in the US.

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is reformulating its strawberry milkshake and pink lemonade recipes to eliminate red dye No. 3, following an FDA announcement requesting companies to expedite the removal of the additive. The fast-food chain is also changing its ketchup recipe to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar. The recipe changes are in response to concerns about the safety of red dye No. 3, which has been linked to cancer in lab animals. These changes reflect a broader trend in the food industry towards removing artificial additives and embracing natural ingredients.</p>

          <p>Smartmatic, the voting machine company, alleges that Fox News executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, destroyed text messages relevant to the company's defamation lawsuit. Smartmatic claims this destruction of evidence was willful and aimed at concealing what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts regarding the 2020 election. The filing comes as Fox News gains access to documents related to a DOJ investigation into Smartmatic executives. Fox denies the allegations and accuses Smartmatic of failing to preserve evidence, setting the stage for a contentious legal battle.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause to the enrollment of more low-income immigrants without legal status for state-funded healthcare benefits in 2026 due to economic uncertainty. The decision is driven by a higher-than-expected price tag on the program and economic uncertainty from federal tariff policies. Low-income adults without legal status will no longer be eligible to apply for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program, starting in 2026. Those who are already enrolled won't be kicked off their plans because of the enrollment freeze, and the changes won't impact children.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to weaken limits on some "forever chemicals" in drinking water that were finalized last year, while maintaining standards for two common ones. The Biden administration set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight. Limits on three types of PFAS, including so-called GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.</p>
