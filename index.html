          <p>Burberry is set to cut 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to save £60 million by 2027. The job cuts, impacting around 20% of the workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. Despite a 6% sales decrease in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly better than analysts' expectations, Burberry shares surged 17%. CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future, citing the company's diversified business model and planned steps to mitigate risks from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former White House ethics counsels argue that Donald Trump is violating the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause through his potential acceptance of a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family, intended for use as Air Force One, and his involvement in crypto ventures tied to Abu Dhabi. They claim that Trump would personally benefit from the use of the plane and that foreign governments could funnel emoluments to him through his crypto company, World Liberty Financial. The article highlights concerns about conflicts of interest, especially regarding crypto regulation, and notes efforts by Senate Democrats to block legislation that doesn't address these issues. The authors suggest restrictions on Trump's crypto investments, such as a blind trust, and emphasize the need for congressional approval for the plane gift due to ethics and national security concerns.</p>

Honeywell anticipates a lower tariff exposure of around $400 million due to reduced duty rates, while Dover emphasizes its manageable supply chains and limited China exposure. Both companies remain confident in their fiscal guidance, with Honeywell noting strong orders and Dover highlighting growth in its biopharma business.

The university has already implemented hiring freezes and suspended merit raises, and faces scaling back research programs due to the funding cuts.

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review President Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, a policy that has been a cornerstone of American identity for over a century. Trump argues that the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States, was intended only to address slavery. Legal challenges have been swift, with courts citing the 1898 United States v. Wong Kim Ark case, which affirmed citizenship for those born in the US regardless of parentage. The case has brought forth debates about the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and the rights of children born to undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, borrowers should consider debt consolidation to manage high-interest credit card debt. Taking initiative, shopping for lenders, and determining the right approach are key steps. Consider alternatives such as a home equity line of credit or a home equity loan, which may offer lower interest rates. By exploring these options, borrowers can work toward regaining financial freedom and securing a more stable financial footing. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy is designed to create complex reporting demands that will cause eligible recipients to lose coverage, as demonstrated by failed state-level implementations.
