          <p>London Southend Airport has ceased operations until further notice after a plane crashed upon takeoff, which witnesses described as a large "fireball." The aircraft, a Beech B200 Super King Air operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, reportedly banked sharply before inverting and hitting the ground. Essex Police and the Air Accident Investigation Branch are investigating the incident, which occurred on a flight from Pula, Croatia. There has been no official confirmation regarding the number of casualties involved in the tragic event.</p>

          <p>Irish golfer Shane Lowry looks back on his triumphant 2019 Open win at Portrush, describing the 24 hours leading up to his final round as one of the toughest periods of his life. He credits his previous failure at the 2016 U.S. Open for teaching him to play aggressively to win, rather than passively trying not to lose. Lowry emphasizes the importance of celebrating major victories due to their difficulty and expresses that while he is content with his career, he remains driven to achieve more.</p>

          <p>A volatile wildfire on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon has destroyed between 50 and 80 structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, visitor facilities, and a water treatment plant. The fire, which expanded to 5,000 acres, also caused a chlorine gas leak that complicated firefighting efforts and forced evacuations. This event is part of a larger pattern of fires in the region, including the White Sage Fire, with smoke from Canadian wildfires simultaneously causing poor air quality across the U.S. Upper Midwest.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows further signs of slowing down. He stated his belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay rises. With the UK economy contracting in recent months and job vacancies falling, many economists now anticipate the Bank will cut its 4.25% rate at its upcoming meeting in August.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new record, breaking past the $122,000 mark in a rally fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This milestone is also supported by increasing institutional adoption and positive sentiment surrounding upcoming U.S. legislation aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. Analysts suggest that long-term institutional buying could propel the cryptocurrency's value even higher, although potential U.S. Federal Reserve policy changes remain a risk.

Although exports to the United States fell for a third consecutive month, the decline slowed thanks to a temporary tariff truce.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, successfully avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, which expanded by 5.5% and 4.4% year-over-year, respectively. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned that significant uncertainty and downside risks remain for the second half of the year due to global trade policy ambiguity.
