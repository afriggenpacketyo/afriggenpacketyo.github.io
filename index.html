Injuries to key starters and bullpen members have contributed to the pitching woes, resulting in the team's highest ERA at this point in the season since 2010.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% due to receding inflation concerns, according to CNBC. This decision marks a shift towards easing monetary policy, as inflation has fallen to a four-year low of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. Despite a recent economic turnaround, analysts have highlighted downside risks related to global trade tensions. The RBA aims to sustainably return inflation to its target range of 2% to 3% while acknowledging economic uncertainties.</p>
