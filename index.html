          <p>Former NFL star Brett Favre suggests that the Netflix documentary "Untold: The Fall of Favre" is targeting him because of his support for former President Donald Trump.

Favre reposted X posts criticizing Netflix, with some users claiming the documentary is a hit piece due to his conservative views. Favre has been a vocal supporter of Trump, endorsing him in 2020 and speaking at a Trump rally in October. </p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked global protests, the Black Lives Matter movement faces challenges, particularly in the US, with many initial hopes for change unfulfilled. Despite some progress in discussions about racism and bans on certain police maneuvers, recent actions by the Trump administration, such as halting DEI programs and ending investigations into police violence, have raised concerns. According to the non-profit Mapping Police Violence project, the police killed at least 1,260 people in the US in 2024, with Black people disproportionately affected. While some remain fatalistic about the current administration, others emphasize the resilience and survival skills of Black communities. </p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on renewing the arms embargo on South Sudan, a nation grappling with a long-simmering conflict that has displaced millions and caused widespread malnourishment. Amnesty International warns that failing to extend the embargo could worsen the human rights situation, citing reports of Ugandan troop deployments in violation of the sanctions. While the UN insists it is doing all it can to stop the conflict, some South Sudanese citizens question the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping efforts. The UN Security Council has extended the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) for 12 months, expressing "deep concern" over the deteriorating situation in the country. </p>
