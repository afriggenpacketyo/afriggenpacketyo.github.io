          <p>At a campaign-style rally in Iowa, President Trump celebrated the passage of his signature tax and spending package, which he called a birthday present for America.

          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has banned U.S. trading firm Jane Street from its securities market, accusing it of widespread manipulation. The regulator alleges the firm used a complex strategy to artificially influence India's Nifty 50 index to generate illicit profits from options trades. Consequently, SEBI has ordered a freeze of over $566 million in alleged illegal gains from the firm's accounts. Jane Street has disputed the findings and stated its commitment to operating in compliance with all regional regulations.</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The charges originated from an incident during a 2021 party where a 21-year-old woman was incapacitated after heavy drinking and therefore unable to provide consent. While the defense argued the encounter was consensual, prosecutors successfully presented evidence of the victim's incapacitation and her testimony that she froze in terror during the assault. Sentencing for the former basketball player is scheduled for the following week.</p>

          <h2>Data Shows Sharp Rise in ICE Detention of Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 21:04:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals that the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention population is composed of immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently held in ICE detention do not have a criminal record. This trend marks a significant shift in enforcement strategy, challenging the official narrative that operations primarily target dangerous criminals and instead showing a broader focus on individuals for their immigration status alone.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old American pilot attempting a solo flight to every continent has been detained on King George Island in Antarctica. Chilean authorities stopped Ethan Guo after he allegedly submitted a false flight plan and then deviated from it, which activated an alert. He has since been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code as well as the international Antarctic Treaty. Guo, who is undertaking the ambitious flight to raise money for cancer research, posted on social media to confirm to his followers that he is alive and safe.</p>

          <p>Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman, has been released from U.S. immigration detention after being held for more than four months. She was detained in February while returning from her honeymoon in the U.S. Virgin Islands, despite having lived in the U.S. since childhood and complying with all ICE check-in requirements. During her confinement, the government made two attempts to deport her, one of which was in defiance of a judge's order, highlighting the precarious legal situation faced by stateless individuals in the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>Significant staffing shortages within the National Park Service are leading to safety concerns at popular summer destinations, such as Maryland's Assateague Island National Seashore where lifeguard towers are now shuttered. Advocacy groups attribute the shortages to a federal hiring freeze and budget cuts under the Trump administration, which have reportedly reduced the park service's permanent staff by 24%. While the NPS acknowledges a nationwide lifeguard shortage, local officials and park advocates worry that fewer staff members put millions of annual visitors at greater risk.</p>

          <p>A woman has filed a lawsuit against prominent soccer agent Jonathan Barnett and his former agency, CAA Stellar, accusing him of human trafficking and repeated sexual assault. The lawsuit alleges that Barnett lured the woman to the U.K. with a false promise of employment but then held her in bondage from 2017 to 2023, forcing her to perform degrading acts. Barnett has vehemently denied the allegations as having "no basis in reality," while CAA noted the woman never had a business connection to the company.</p>

          <p>Two new research-focused universities in China, founded by prominent business tycoons, are set to enroll their first classes of undergraduate students this summer. Fuyao University, established by glass magnate Cao Dewang, and Eastern Institute of Technology, from semiconductor leader Yu Renrong, represent a new trend in private philanthropy aimed at boosting China's goal of scientific self-reliance. Observers predict these new, well-funded institutions will be highly selective and could soon compete with top public universities for the nation's best students.</p>

          <p>A New York jury has convicted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs on two lesser charges of transporting women for the purpose of prostitution, but acquitted him of the most serious racketeering and sex trafficking counts. The verdict is seen as a mixed result for the star, who still faces a significant prison sentence and whose reputation has been severely damaged by revelations from the trial. While some supporters celebrated the outcome, the convictions and the sordid details of his parties will likely complicate any future comeback attempts.</p>
