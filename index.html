          <p>With summer travel in full swing, some passengers are using a viral hack to avoid baggage fees by stuffing clothes and soft items into pillowcases, which are typically allowed on board for free. Travel expert Francesca Page noted an increase in people carrying pillows, realizing they were being used to carry bulky items. However, travel industry expert Gary Leff suggests that the trick is becoming too obvious and risky, as airlines are catching on. Some passengers are resorting to wearing multiple layers of clothing to avoid fees, highlighting the lengths people will go to save money on baggage.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting smugglers of Pop Mart toys, particularly the Labubu and Molly series, due to soaring prices driven by the retailer's global expansion. Travelers are reportedly purchasing the toys overseas, where they are cheaper due to currency fluctuations or local discounts, and attempting to resell them in China. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions. Peng Peng, from the Guangdong Society of Reform think tank, attributes the high prices to both hype and international popularity, attracting interest from consumers and businesspeople alike.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million by Ofwat, the UK's water regulator, for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by the regulator. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and Â£18.2 million for "undeserved dividends," the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for such payouts. Thames Water, currently under a "cash lock up," faces heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks and is burdened by a Â£20 billion debt. The company serves about a quarter of the UK's population, primarily in London and southern England, and secured an emergency Â£3 billion in March to avoid collapse.</p>

          <p>Tesco is introducing AI technology with overhead cameras at some self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record highs in the UK. The system identifies when items are not scanned properly and shows a live-action replay to the customer, prompting some shoppers to joke about its resemblance to football's Video Assistant Referee (VAR). While some customers mocked the technology, others expressed concern over increased surveillance, with some stating they would avoid self-checkouts altogether. A Tesco worker expressed gratitude for the new technology, citing the challenges of monitoring multiple self-checkouts simultaneously amidst a high rate of customer theft.</p>

          <p>The State Department, under Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has temporarily halted interviews for student and exchange visas to expand scrutiny of applicants' social media posts. The order, detailed in a cable to U.S. embassies and consulates, pauses new interview appointments until further guidance is provided, though existing appointments should proceed. This move aligns with President Trump's efforts to influence campus speech, particularly concerning anti-Israel sentiments, and follows Rubio's previous actions to revoke visas and scrutinize foreign visitors' social media. Critics argue that the administration is suppressing free speech and promoting ideological conformity through these measures.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has agreed to pay the federal government $82.5 million to settle claims related to the 2020 Bobcat Fire, which devastated areas northeast of Los Angeles. The settlement, announced by the U.S. Department of Justice, compensates taxpayers for the costs of fighting the fire and the extensive damage to public lands. The government alleged that the fire was caused by improperly maintained trees contacting power lines owned by SCE and its tree maintenance contractor. The Bobcat Fire charred approximately 178 square miles, leading to the closure of campgrounds and trails and damaging the habitat of endangered species.</p>

Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and support to customers after a review by Ofgem revealed suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. The scandal emerged during the cost of living crisis, with energy firms switching struggling customers to prepayment, sometimes forcibly entering homes to install new meters.

          <p>Japan's bond market is causing concerns about capital outflows from the U.S. and a potential carry trade unwind as long-dated yields rise. Demand for 40-year government bonds has weakened, pushing yields near record highs, potentially triggering Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S. Albert Edwards of Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking warns that rising yields and a stronger yen could lead to a global financial market crisis, impacting U.S. tech stocks that have seen significant Japanese investment. Other analysts suggest the carry trade impact may be gradual due to the erosion in confidence in the U.S. dollar, while some believe Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries are structurally sound due to the broader U.S.-Japan alliance (not investment advice).</p>

The Super Heavy booster, used in a previous flight, was also lost during a simulated landing, though SpaceX was testing its performance limits.

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that Russia has gathered 50,000 troops near Ukraine's Sumy region, indicating preparations for a potential offensive. Kyiv has taken steps to prevent a large-scale Russian offensive in the area, with Russia's strongest forces currently on the Kursk front. Putin has expressed his desire for a "buffer zone" along Russia's border with Ukraine, which Kyiv believes would extend approximately 10 kilometers. Zelenskyy also noted that Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian troops in the Kostyantynivka area by 4 kilometers.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is reportedly threatening to strike Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension has led to discussions between President Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, with Israel concerned that the U.S. deal may allow Iran to keep its enrichment facilities. Israel has been enhancing its capabilities to strike Iranian targets, including destroying elements of Iran's air defense system. Mr. Netanyahu insists that only a deal dismantling Iran's nuclear infrastructure is acceptable, while the U.S. seeks a negotiated end to the program backed by the threat of military action.</p>

          <p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to elect Karol Nawrocki, a conservative candidate backed by Donald Trump, during a CPAC meeting in Poland. Noem described Nawrocki as someone who would lead Poland in a style similar to Trump and implied that electing him would strengthen the U.S.-Poland relationship. CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp opened the conference by claiming conservatives are battling "globalists" and emphasized the importance of winning elections, including in Poland, to protect freedom.</p>

          <p>A former 999 call-handler, Issy Vine, resigned from the Met Police after a colleague she reported for making offensive comments, including describing a sexual assault victim as a "slut," was reinstated following an appeal. Vine is suing the force for constructive dismissal, accusing the Met of failing to uphold its promises to listen to whistleblowers and root out toxic behavior. Vine reported the colleague's comments shortly after the publication of the Casey Review, which found the Met to be institutionally misogynist, racist, and homophobic, and said the reinstatement left her feeling like a fraud.</p>
