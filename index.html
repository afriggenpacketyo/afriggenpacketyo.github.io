          <p>Former President Donald Trump has pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, stars of "Chrisley Knows Best," who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. The couple was found guilty of conspiring to defraud Atlanta-area community banks for over $36 million in loans and conspiring to defraud the IRS. Todd received a 12-year prison sentence, while Julie was sentenced to seven years. Trump stated he hopes to have them "free and clean" soon, adding that he does not know them personally, but sympathizes with their situation due to what he believes is an unjust justice system.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, experienced an uncontrolled reentry during its ninth test flight after a propellant leak caused it to spin out of control. The upper-stage vehicle broke up as it re-entered the atmosphere, with debris falling into the Indian Ocean. While the flight reached space and surpassed previous tests, several planned tests were not conducted, including evaluating heat shield tiles. Elon Musk noted the mission achieved improvements over previous flights, such as reaching the scheduled engine cutoff, but acknowledged the need for further improvements to Starship's reliability.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty in finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent grads account for 12% of the increase in unemployment since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The unemployment rate among 22-27 year olds with college degrees is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, largely due to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates and waning business demand in sectors like technology. Economic uncertainty and the impact of tariffs are also contributing to the slowdown in hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Families in Northumberland, England, are facing distress after their homes were purchased for a road-widening project that was later cancelled. National Highways spent over ¬£4m acquiring properties, which now sit empty and are deteriorating. The cancelled A1 project has left families displaced, with some having moved miles away and others watching their former homes fall into disrepair. National Highways stated discussions about the future of the properties are ongoing, but families are seeking a resolution to the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking to cut an estimated $100 million in funding from Harvard University, escalating its battle with the institution. The Government Services Administration (GSA) plans to send a letter to federal agencies to review Harvard's grants and identify contracts that could be cancelled or redirected. The administration claims Harvard has engaged in discrimination and antisemitism, but critics argue these actions are an excuse to penalize the university. This follows previous attempts to block Harvard's funding and restrict international student enrollment.</p>
