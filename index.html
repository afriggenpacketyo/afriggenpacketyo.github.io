          <p>A report suggests that the closure of Scotland's only oil refinery at Grangemouth could lead to the creation of up to 800 green jobs over the next 15 years.  The study identifies potential investment opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production, and plastics recycling.
