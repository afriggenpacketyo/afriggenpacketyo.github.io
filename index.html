          <h2>Tech Stocks Fluctuate Amid Tariff Concerns and Market Volatility</h2>

          <p>Technology stocks experienced a turbulent trading session as President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to global tariffs, causing market uncertainty. The Magnificent Seven stocks, including Nvidia, Apple, and Meta, initially rallied but later declined. The tech sector is recovering from a brutal week where these stocks collectively lost over $1.8 trillion in market value, with the Nasdaq Composite entering a bear market. This volatility reflects investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on the tech industry and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield increased above 4% despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an economic slowdown. This rise occurred even as traders increased expectations for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in response to a potentially weaker economy. Investors are grappling with the implications of the recently unveiled tariffs, which have sparked fears of a global trade war as countries retaliate with their own tariffs. Despite these concerns, Trump has downplayed the tariffs' impact, stating they are necessary to fix trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

The victim's wife and son raised the alarm and Mr. Perks was transferred to hospital where he underwent surgery and was not discharged for more than a month.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. OPEC+ producers' decision to increase production and Saudi Aramco's price cuts have also contributed to the price decline. While Trump touted the lower oil prices, worries are growing that tariffs could increase business costs, slow economic activity, and ultimately reduce demand for oil. JPMorgan has raised its recession odds to 60% following the tariff rollout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Minnesota, five sheriff's offices have entered into cooperation agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), contrasting with the state's widespread sanctuary policies. These agreements allow for increased cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE, focusing on identifying and processing undocumented immigrants already in custody. Some officers will receive ICE training, and agencies will maintain regular contact with ICE field offices. This move has led to a rise in immigrant detentions, but critics caution against detaining individuals for minor offenses.</p>

Global stock markets also suffered significant losses, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng experiencing its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

Regular exercise and widening social circles are also vital for improving overall health and longevity.</p>
