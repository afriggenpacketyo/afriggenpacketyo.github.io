          <p>A new report from wealth intelligence firm Altrata forecasts a significant demographic shift among the world's ultra-wealthy, defined as individuals with a net worth of at least $30 million. While baby boomers currently dominate this group, millennials and Gen Z are projected to represent over a third of the ultra-rich population by 2040 due to the ongoing great wealth transfer. This transition is accelerated by the increased use of trusts and family offices, allowing younger generations to access wealth earlier. The report also notes key differences in how younger generations accumulate and spend their fortunes, with a greater focus on technology and entertainment industries and a higher proportion of their wealth in real estate and luxury assets.</p>

          <p>A deadly attack occurred outside a synagogue in Manchester, England, during the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, resulting in the deaths of two individuals. The suspect reportedly used a vehicle to ram into people before carrying out stabbings, and was subsequently shot and killed by police officers who responded swiftly to the scene. The incident, which left three other members of the public seriously injured, has prompted heightened security measures at synagogues across the U.K. and has been widely condemned by political leaders and King Charles III.</p>

          <p>A growing number of parents are installing landline phones for their children as a way to foster communication skills without the associated risks of smartphones and social media. This trend is driven by concerns over the mental health impacts of constant connectivity, with landlines offering a low-pressure, distraction-free way for kids to talk to friends and family. The article explores how this retro technology appeals to both parents seeking a safer alternative and children who find the tactile, "old-timey" nature of the devices novel and exciting, reflecting a broader interest in analog experiences.</p>

          <h2>Goldman Sachs Report Finds a Growing Number of Americans Living Paycheck to Paycheck, Hindering Retirement Savings</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Goldman Sachs reveals that a rising number of working Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, making it increasingly difficult for them to save for retirement. The report indicates that 42% of younger workers have no spare savings after covering basic living expenses, a figure projected to exceed half of all Americans by 2033 due to the rising costs of housing and healthcare. The analysis highlights a systemic "financial vortex" where simply advising workers to "save more" is unrealistic, and it notes potential strategies like early savings and alternative investments to bridge the growing retirement gap.

          <p>Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has been officially announced as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, a decision that has sparked cultural debate. The artist, known for his record-breaking streaming numbers and unapologetic celebration of Latino culture, is also a politically outspoken figure, having endorsed Kamala Harris and supported Puerto Rican independence. The selection is seen by many as a significant moment for Latino representation on one of America's largest stages, especially in a politically charged climate.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has announced a deal to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO Vicki Hollub stated will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. The deal deepens the existing relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum.</p>

However, the backlash was soon overwhelmed by a massive influx of support from the local community and people across the nation, who lined up to patronize the business. De Luca described being "flooded with righteous people" who defended her gesture and Kirk's legacy, turning a moment of controversy into a significant financial success.</p>

          <p>Google's self-driving car company, Waymo, stands out in the AI industry for its deliberate and safety-focused strategy, contrasting sharply with the 'move fast and break things' mentality of other tech giants. With an impressive safety record over 96 million autonomous miles, Waymo's robotaxis have been involved in significantly fewer serious accidents compared to human-driven cars. This methodical, 16-year development process, while costly and yet to be profitable, has allowed the company to build a more reliable system than competitors like Tesla and the now-defunct Cruise. The article suggests that in a field with life-or-death stakes, Waymo's slow and steady approach may be a crucial lesson for the broader AI world.</p>

The Chelsea Supporters' Trust criticized a 77.5% price hike for a match against Benfica compared to a similar fixture last season, accusing the club of exploiting fan loyalty. The high demand for tickets at the 40,000-seat Stamford Bridge has exacerbated the issue of touts, with an estimated 2,000 tickets per game being resold illegally. While the club is taking steps to cancel illicitly purchased tickets, the tensions highlight a broader Premier League-wide issue of rising costs for dedicated supporters.</p>

While use of the cooling vests is not mandatory for drivers, the system must be installed to prevent a weight advantage for those who opt out.

The 2026 draft budget reveals plans to raise the VAT from 20% to 22% and lower the VAT threshold for small businesses, effectively passing the war's financial burden onto the public. This move comes as economic growth forecasts are downgraded significantly, from a projected 2.5% this year to just 1.3% in 2026.

Firefighter dispatch records confirm at least 35 calls related to electrical problems in the area before the main blaze was reported. Despite these issues, utility Southern California Edison did not shut off power to most circuits in Altadena, raising questions about its fire prevention protocols.</p>

He argued that the artifact was the property of the American people and should not be given away, instead offering to help procure a replica. Ultimately, a replica was sourced from West Point, but the dispute reportedly created tension, leading to the departure of the career historian from his post.</p>

While the case is widely seen as weak, it highlights the potential for a president to bend the department to their will, raising questions about the durability of post-Watergate norms that have historically insulated it from overt political pressure. Legal experts note that institutional checks, such as grand juries refusing to indict in other politically charged cases, have shown surprising resilience.

          <p>A new study in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that the alarming surge in cancer cases among adults under 50 might be partially a "diagnostic mirage." While diagnoses for eight fast-rising cancers have nearly doubled since 1990, the study found that the rate of metastatic cases has not increased as quickly, and the overall death rate has remained flat. The researchers argue this points to an "epidemic of diagnosis" rather than an epidemic of disease, where increased screening and better technology are detecting cancers that might never have become clinically significant. However, other experts caution that for specific cancers like colorectal and uterine, death rates have genuinely increased, warning against oversimplifying the trend.</p>

While some of Hamas's political leadership in Qatar are reportedly open to the deal with adjustments, their influence is limited without control over the hostages.

The continued existence of these suboptimal pastas is largely attributed to nostalgia and their common use in dishes like pasta salads served at potlucks.

The plea comes as the supermarket giant upgraded its annual profit forecast, attributing the positive outlook to increased customer shopping volume despite cutting prices on thousands of items. The Unite union, however, criticized the company for profiting from the cost of living crisis while consumers struggle.</p>

          <h2>White House Warns of Imminent Federal Worker Layoffs as Government Shutdown Continues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown enters its second day, the White House has announced that mass layoffs of federal workers are "imminent" and could become permanent within days. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of political maneuvering and urged them to reopen the government rather than complain about the administration's response. The shutdown began after Congress failed to agree on a spending plan, with Democrats demanding guarantees on healthcare funding and Republicans pushing for a temporary measure. With no compromise in sight and the Senate adjourned until Friday, hundreds of thousands of federal employees remain on unpaid leave, risking significant disruption to government services and the broader economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government has shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to pass a new spending bill, placing approximately 750,000 federal workers on unpaid leave. The impasse stems from a dispute over healthcare funding, with Democrats demanding an extension of tax credits and a reversal of Medicaid cuts before agreeing to a deal. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control will continue, many agencies will be severely impacted, and national parks and museums may close. This shutdown is particularly tense as it occurs under a Trump administration that has already reduced the size of government and signaled a willingness to use the situation to make further permanent cuts.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian man, deported from the United States to Ghana as part of a controversial "third-country" policy, claims he and five other deportees were secretly transferred and abandoned in neighboring Togo by Ghanaian officers. He alleges they were taken through an unofficial border crossing and are now stranded in a hotel without documentation, struggling to survive. The man, who fears persecution in Nigeria due to his political activism, was part of a group of West Africans accepted by Ghana in a spirit of "pan-African empathy." The incident raises further questions about the legality and human rights implications of the U.S. deportation strategy and Ghana's role in it.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed the lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album 'Nevermind'. Elden had sued the band and its photographer, arguing the image constituted child pornography and commercial sexual exploitation. However, Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that the photograph does not meet the legal standard for child pornography, stating that nudity alone is insufficient and must be coupled with sexually provocative circumstances. The judge likened the image to a family photo of a child bathing and noted that Elden had previously embraced his connection to the iconic album cover. Elden's legal team has announced plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>A section of Hacienda Napoles, the infamous former estate of drug lord Pablo Escobar, has been handed over to female victims of Colombia's long-running armed conflict. President Gustavo Petro announced that 297 acres of the lavish property, once a symbol of Escobar's immense wealth and power, will now be used by local women farmers. After Escobar's death in 1993, the estate was converted into a popular theme park, but this recent move is part of a broader land reform program aimed at addressing historical inequities that have fueled the country's conflict. The estate is also well-known for its population of "cocaine hippos," descendants of exotic animals Escobar illegally imported.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear 'Chiles v. Salazar', a case that questions whether states can ban licensed therapists from practicing "conversion therapy" on minors without violating the First Amendment. The case, brought by a therapist represented by the conservative firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argues that Colorado's ban on treatments purporting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Conversely, the state and major medical organizations contend that conversion therapy is a harmful and ineffective practice, and that states have a right to regulate professional speech to protect patients from substandard care. The outcome could have significant implications for both LGBTQ rights and the regulation of professional conduct.</p>

The meeting featured lengthy addresses from both Hegseth and Trump, who outlined plans to reshape the military to align with personal and Republican preferences and told officers to resign if they did not support his agenda.</p>

          <p>Airlines worldwide are confronting a significant pilot shortage, a crisis exacerbated by a post-pandemic surge in air travel and a wave of early retirements. During the pandemic, pilot training programs were paused, creating a backlog that schools are now struggling to clear, while many senior pilots chose to leave the profession. This has created a dual challenge of replacing experienced aviators and recruiting new ones to meet rising demand. In response, airlines are increasing pay, offering bonuses, and some are lobbying to raise the mandatory retirement age from 65 to 67 to keep more pilots in the cockpit.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown, triggered by a dispute over funding priorities established in the Trump administration's "big ugly bill," has presented Democrats with significant negotiating power. Because Republicans need Democratic votes to pass a spending bill outside of the reconciliation process, Democrats are in a position to demand the restoration of cuts to healthcare programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. The article argues that Democrats should use this leverage, as caving in would mean accepting a budget they universally opposed. Furthermore, with the administration already showing a willingness to illegally impound funds and fire employees, a vote to reopen the government offers no guarantee that it would actually be kept running as intended.</p>
