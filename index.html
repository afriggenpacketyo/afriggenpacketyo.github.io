        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), responsible for crucial economic indicators like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is facing significant funding shortages. These financial constraints are forcing the agency to cut corners, such as reducing the scope and frequency of data collection for inflation and employment figures. Consequently, the reliability and accuracy of America's key economic data are diminishing, potentially leading to misguided policy decisions by the government and the Federal Reserve. This degradation of data quality complicates the ability to get a clear picture of the nation's economic health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British Conservative Member of Parliament George Freeman has voluntarily referred himself to the parliamentary standards commissioner following allegations of improper lobbying. A report from the Sunday Times claimed that Freeman, while working as a paid advisor for an environmental monitoring company, sought their input on questions to ask the government. This potentially violates rules set by a government watchdog, which had previously advised him not to lobby on behalf of the firm due to his former role as science minister. Freeman denies any wrongdoing but stated he will accept the commissioner's judgment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is currently operating without a confirmed or acting director, creating a significant leadership void. This situation legally places Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known anti-vaccine activist, in direct control of the agency's decisions, including vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has already dismissed experienced vaccine advisers and altered CDC guidance on COVID-19 vaccines. The lack of a clear, Senate-confirmed leader and the potential for politically motivated decisions on public health matters are raising alarm among legal and medical experts.</p>

          <p>A Catholic school in a New Orleans suburb has fired a music teacher, Mark Richards, after 21 years of employment upon discovering he was the widower of another man. The dismissal was based on a morality clause in his contract prohibiting conduct contrary to Catholic teachings, which was brought to the archdiocese's attention by a parent who found his husband's obituary. The firing has sparked outrage among other parents at the school, who have started a petition calling the decision unjust and a violation of human rights. The incident occurs as the New Orleans archdiocese navigates bankruptcy related to clergy sexual abuse scandals.</p>

Citing examples from activists in the Congo to community organizers in St. Louis, the article posits that collective actions like protests and local aid are vital.

Despite their persistent efforts, they often face rejection and indifference, particularly from Republican members of Congress who control the legislative agenda.

          <p>The population of lone star ticks, which can cause a severe red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome, is rapidly expanding across the eastern United States. Experts attribute this "explosive increase" to rising temperatures from the climate crisis, allowing the aggressive ticks to spread from the Southeast to northern and western regions. The number of alpha-gal cases has surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially as many as 450,000, with symptoms ranging from hives to life-threatening reactions hours after consuming meat. This public health issue is expected to worsen as the ticks' habitat continues to grow.</p>

Paying drink-by-drink can help individuals better monitor their alcohol consumption and spending, promoting fiscal responsibility. The habit also reflects a broader trend of younger adults drinking less alcohol overall and being wary of leaving credit cards with the bar.</p>

While Lotus has paused production to manage inventory, the company has publicly stated it has "no plans to close the factory" and that the UK remains the "heart of the Lotus brand."

Maresca argued that such frequent and lengthy interruptions are not normal in football and suggested the U.S. is "probably not the right place" for the competition.

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart enriching uranium for a potential nuclear bomb in a "matter of months." This assessment follows recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Grossi said caused severe but not total damage, contradicting President Trump's claims of obliteration. Iran has since refused IAEA inspectors access to the damaged sites and has moved to suspend cooperation with the watchdog. The situation remains tense, with Iran's military chief expressing doubts that Israel will adhere to the current ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Iran-Israel Ceasefire is Fragile and Netanyahu Prefers Perpetual Conflict</h2>

          <p>In an opinion piece, analyst Simon Tisdall contends that the recently agreed-upon ceasefire between Iran and Israel is unlikely to hold. He argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not genuinely interested in peace but rather benefits from a "forever war" to maintain power, distract from domestic failures, and keep regional adversaries weak. The article suggests that despite the recent strikes, Iran's nuclear know-how remains, and any sign of rebuilding could provoke another Israeli attack. Tisdall concludes that the conflict achieved little, inflamed tensions, and highlights the danger of impulsive military actions by world leaders.</p>

          <p>In the week following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting statements from President Trump and his administration have created confusion about the mission's success. While Trump has repeatedly claimed the facilities were "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggest the damage may only set back Iran's program by a few months. Top officials have also shifted their descriptions, sometimes emphasizing the achievement of a ceasefire with Israel as the primary goal rather than the complete destruction of Iran's nuclear capabilities. These evolving narratives have led to ongoing questions about the actual extent of the damage and the strategic objectives of the strike.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that California's common historical narratives, found in everything from visitor guides to restaurant menus, consistently erase or whitewash the state's violent colonial past and the rich history of its Indigenous peoples. The author points out that official stories often leap from a brief mention of pre-colonial tribes to the arrival of Spanish and American settlers, ignoring the genocide and ethnic cleansing that occurred. Even progressive institutions like UC Berkeley are criticized for failing to fully acknowledge their role in plundering Indigenous graves and land.

          <p>President Trump's decision to order a major bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities reflects what analysts describe as his "One-and-Done" military doctrine. This approach favors discrete, high-impact military actions over sustained campaigns, aligning with his aversion to "endless wars." Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a willingness to authorize significant strikes, like the one against Qassem Soleimani, but has resisted long-term entanglements. The recent Iran attack, which he framed as a single, decisive blow, fits this pattern. However, it remains uncertain whether this one-off action will be sufficient to achieve long-term strategic goals regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>The surprisingly muted reactions from China and Russia to the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran reveal the limits of their so-called "axis of antagonism" against the West. This analysis argues that while the three nations share an opposition to U.S. influence, their strategic interests diverge significantly when global stability is threatened. For China, its economic ties with the West and need for stability outweigh its support for Iran in a direct military confrontation. This cautious approach suggests that the "no limits" partnership between Russia and China may also be less robust than advertised, prioritizing self-interest over ideological solidarity.</p>

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for modern seismic safety. The magnitude 6.5-6.8 quake revealed critical vulnerabilities in unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many California cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also prompted Santa Barbara to adopt new building codes and a unified Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that defines the city today. However, experts note that many potentially vulnerable structures, like soft-story apartment buildings, still exist, highlighting an ongoing reluctance to enforce the strictest safety measures.</p>

          <p>Markus SÃ¶der, the state premier of Bavaria and leader of the opposition CSU party, has called for Germany to build a massive missile defense shield similar to Israel's "Iron Dome." Citing potential threats, SÃ¶der advocated for acquiring thousands of drones, new missile systems, and approximately 2,000 Patriot systems to create a comprehensive protective shield for the country. His proposal also includes a significant increase in conventional military hardware, such as new tanks and fighter jets. This call for a major expansion of Germany's defense capabilities reflects growing security concerns within Europe and a push for greater military preparedness.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap performed a highly-charged set at the Glastonbury Festival, drawing a massive crowd after being at the center of a political controversy. The band, whose member Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh is facing a terrorism charge he denies, used the platform to hit back at UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had called their appearance "not appropriate." During their set, the trio voiced support for Palestine and criticized the UK's arms sales to Israel, leading the audience in expletive-laden chants against the prime minister. Glastonbury organizers defended their decision to have the band perform, emphasizing the festival as a platform for diverse voices.</p>
