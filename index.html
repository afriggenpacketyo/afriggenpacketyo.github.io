          <p>The Universal Postal Union, a UN agency, has reported a staggering 80% decrease in postal traffic to the United States after new tariffs came into effect. The change stems from the Trump administration's decision to abolish the long-standing "de minimis" exemption, which had allowed small packages valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. Global postal operators were not given adequate time to implement systems for collecting these new duties, leading to what the UPU described as "major operational disruptions" and the suspension of services by 88 countries.

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was killed in a shark attack off a popular beach in northern Sydney, Australia. The experienced surfer was with friends when the incident occurred, resulting in the loss of multiple limbs before he could be brought to shore. Authorities have closed nearby beaches for at least 24 hours while they patrol the area and work to identify the species of shark involved. While shark encounters are a known risk in Australia, fatal attacks remain statistically rare events globally.</p>

A vice president of the Italian bishops conference celebrated Mass for the group, stating it is time to restore dignity to all who have been denied it.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a significant stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at revitalizing growth. The proposal urges PepsiCo to refranchise its bottling network, divest underperforming brands such as Quaker, and rationalize its extensive product lineup. Elliott argues that these moves would free up capital to reinvest in core, high-performing brands like Pepsi and Frito-Lay, ultimately unlocking at least 50% in shareholder value.

Using machine learning, a study found that more frequent thunderstorms combined with hotter, drier conditions will heighten fire risk in 98% of the region.
