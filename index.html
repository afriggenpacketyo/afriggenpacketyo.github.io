        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's removal via Truth Social, short-term Treasury yields declined while long-term yields increased. Investors interpreted this as a signal of potential future rate cuts and a perceived erosion of Fed independence, consequently making ownership of long-term bonds less favorable. Cook's attorney promptly stated she would challenge the removal, asserting Trump lacks the legal authority to do so. This political intervention caused notable shifts in the U.S. dollar and bond markets, as financial observers also parsed recent economic reports and awaited further inflation data for clues on the central bank's next moves, regardless of the political pressure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared his administration seeks at least $500 million from Harvard University to restore billions in federal funding, amid a protracted dispute over the school's handling of antisemitism and pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard has sued the administration over these funding cuts, arguing they are retaliatory and unlawfully imposed. While reports suggested a potential $500 million settlement, Harvard's president has disputed their accuracy, emphasizing the university's commitment to academic freedom and resolving the matter through the courts. This ongoing conflict highlights Trump's broader efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite institutions over their management of campus protests and other policies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve stated it would abide by any court decision regarding President Trump's authority to remove Governor Lisa Cook, following his announcement to fire her over alleged mortgage fraud. A Fed spokesperson emphasized that Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs governors to serve long, fixed terms and be removed only "for cause," highlighting these protections as vital safeguards for monetary policy independence. Cook's attorney confirmed a lawsuit would be filed, asserting Trump lacks any factual or legal basis for her removal. This article underscores the central bank's commitment to transparency, accountability, and its statutory mandates, reaffirming its role as an independent institution serving the American people.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party unveiled an ambitious plan to tackle "uncontrolled illegal migration," including mass deportations and human rights law changes, aiming to remove 500,000-600,000 people within a parliamentary term. However, an in-depth analysis questions the plan's practical deliverability and immense financial cost. The article highlights that the proposed scale of deportations and the cost of building 24,000 secure detention facilities are far beyond any previous government's achievements or realistic estimates. Additionally, new laws to fast-track removals have historically been ruled unlawful, and pulling out of treaties like the ECHR could lead to significant legal and international repercussions, potentially impacting the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

          <p>With average credit card APRs near 22% and total balances exceeding $1.2 trillion, many Americans face difficulties affording September credit card payments amidst rising inflation and stretched budgets. This article outlines several proactive steps to avoid missed payments and potential credit damage. Recommendations include immediately contacting credit card companies to inquire about hardship programs, exploring debt management plans and credit counseling services, carefully considering balance transfers to cards with 0% introductory APRs, and evaluating debt consolidation loans to combine multiple high-interest debts into a single, more manageable payment. The overarching advice emphasizes taking swift action to prevent further financial strain and long-term credit score repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

The retirement of three Democratic senators creates possible openings for the GOP, while Democrats are eyeing competitive races in states like North Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Michigan.

The Department of Homeland Security denied racial profiling, stating agents targeted a "criminal illegal alien" and praised the mother for assisting in the later arrest of the boy's cousin, an unauthorized immigrant with a concealed weapon conviction.

          <p>President Trump's unprecedented attempts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and exert influence over interest rates are raising serious questions about the central bank's independence and potential risks to the US economy. This article highlights the Fed's crucial role, established since 1913, in maintaining price stability and maximum employment, ideally free from political interference, to prevent damaging "boom and bust" cycles and control inflation. While financial markets have shown a relatively muted reaction so far, some experts warn that undermining the Fed's credibility could lead to higher US government borrowing costs and global financial instability. The ongoing legal battle over Cook's removal underscores this significant challenge to a cornerstone of American economic stability.</p>

Among the rescued creatures were several endangered species with the highest international protection, including two ring-tailed lemurs, a Bali starling, and two Asian otters, alongside a zebra, kinkajous, and meerkats. Authorities also recovered three macaws, two of which had been reported stolen from a town in Almería. The estimated market value of the seized animals is nearly $81,500.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether gold prices, currently around $3,374.77 per ounce after significant gains in 2024, will fall in September, presenting a mixed outlook for investors. A potential decline in August inflation could lead to lower gold prices due to its inverse relationship with the dollar's purchasing power, reducing the need for alternative assets. Conversely, an increasingly likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, with over an 87% chance, could cause gold prices to rise, as historically lower rates increase demand for the metal. Given this inherent uncertainty, the article suggests investors consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging or fractional investments to get involved, acknowledging that gold prices generally trend upward over time despite short-term fluctuations.

          <p>The Trump administration, through Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, threatened to cut millions in federal funding to California, Washington, and New Mexico for failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. This action follows a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn. Duffy emphasized the critical safety aspect, stating truckers need to understand road signs and communicate effectively with law enforcement. The states have 30 days to comply with the rules, with California facing a potential $33 million loss from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office criticized the move as an attempt to deflect blame, arguing the administration itself approved the driver's federal work permit.</p>

They are common in arid and semi-arid regions globally, including the US Southwest, particularly under severe drought conditions. Haboobs significantly reduce visibility, posing extreme dangers for drivers, who are advised to pull off the road, stop, turn off all lights, and set emergency brakes to ensure safety.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to seek the death penalty for murder prosecutions in Washington D.C., describing it as a "very strong preventative" measure. Speaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump's call comes amidst a deployment of National Guard and federal law enforcement to the capital to combat crime, a strategy he has hinted could extend to other Democratic-run cities like Chicago and Baltimore. Washington D.C. currently does not have the death penalty, having repealed it decades ago, and its residents overwhelmingly voted against capital punishment in a 2002 referendum. Trump, who reinstated the federal death penalty through an executive order in January, did not provide further details on how he would implement this change.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that top Pentagon officials are "thinking about" the US government acquiring equity stakes in leading defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. This consideration follows the administration's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel stock for approximately $9 billion. Lutnick suggested President Trump is rethinking how the US finances its defense capabilities, claiming the current system has been a "giveaway." While a Lockheed spokesperson affirmed a strong working relationship with the administration, critics, including some conservatives, warn that such government control over private companies could undermine free market principles and introduce political rather than commercial considerations into business decisions, posing risks to both the companies and the broader economy.

He emphasized that thorough security screenings are conducted for these students, and noted Secretary of State Marco Rubio supports oversight of student admissions.

Authorities believe the couple faked the infant's disappearance and presume him dead. Rebecca Haro initially claimed she was attacked while changing Emmanuel’s diaper, but inconsistencies in her statement led to her non-cooperation and the parents' arrest. Jake Haro has a prior child abuse conviction from 2023 involving his daughter, who suffered serious injuries.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global approval filings. The pill, a potential needle-free alternative in the lucrative GLP-1 market, helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their weight at 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While existing injections show greater weight loss, this oral option offers "unprecedented efficacy" for this patient group. Despite mainly gastrointestinal side effects, its convenience and potential for broader access and lower pricing make it a significant development in obesity and diabetes treatment.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account for savers looking to protect and grow their money without stock market volatility. While CD rates are fixed and predictable throughout their term, high-yield savings account rates are variable and can change, especially with future rate cuts. The article provides examples showing that, depending on the term length (e.g., 3, 6, 9 months, or 1 year), either a CD or a high-yield savings account could earn slightly more interest. It emphasizes that CD earnings are guaranteed, offering stability, whereas high-yield savings accounts offer flexibility. Savers are advised to carefully calculate potential earnings and consider their liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The property was once owned by Friedrich Kadgien, a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after WWII. The artwork, listed on a database of lost wartime art, was identified when Kadgien's daughter put the house up for sale. Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate are now working to reclaim the painting, which is one of over 1,100 works forcibly sold from his collection.

The ruling comes amidst a nationwide wave of mid-decade redistricting battles, spurred by President Trump's push for Republican gains in states like Texas and Indiana, and Democratic counter-efforts in California.

This high concentration, with the top 10 holdings representing approximately 40% of the index, means S&P 500 investment is largely a bet on tech and AI.

Boulter, 29, lost 6-4 6-4 to Ukrainian 27th seed Marta Kostyuk, continuing her Grand Slam struggles and her inability to reach the second week of a major. Despite her loss and recent form issues, Boulter expressed a renewed "buzz" and a new perspective after taking time off, focusing on improving her serve for future tournaments.</p>
