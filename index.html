          <p>South Korea and Japan are intensifying efforts to support their domestic shipbuilding industries as the United States takes aim at China's dominance in the sector. South Korea's new presidential administration has pledged to revive what it calls a core industry in major crisis, outlining policy guidelines focused on developing autonomous and eco-friendly ships. These measures aim to enhance production through digitalization, automation, and improved working conditions. The strategic push comes as global trade dynamics shift, creating an opportunity for these nations to reclaim market share and advance maritime technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark is confirmed to miss her fifth consecutive game, and ninth of the season, due to a persistent groin injury. The standout player has been out of action since a game against the Los Angeles Sparks on June 26. Before this season, Clark had an unbroken record of not missing any games throughout her college or professional career, making her recent string of absences notable. Coach Stephanie White indicated that Clark participated in some practice drills but was not at full capacity, with her condition being evaluated daily. The Fever have managed a winning record recently despite her absence.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Allowing Quick Sale of Towed Vehicles Faces Criticism as Predatory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A controversial law in Connecticut is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell seized vehicles just 15 days after they are towed. Critics and affected residents argue the law is predatory, disproportionately targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods where people may struggle to afford the high fees to retrieve their cars on short notice. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of systematically targeting apartment complexes to tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. The company owner defends the practice, stating he is simply enforcing the rules established by the properties.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in rural San Luis Obispo County has escalated to become the largest wildfire in California this year, scorching over 70,800 acres. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, poses a significant threat to life and property, with over 200 people under evacuation orders and 50 structures threatened. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire has prompted a massive response involving more than 600 personnel, numerous fire engines, and air tankers from across the state.

          <p>President Trump has signed into law a major tax and spending bill, making his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also funding significant expansions in border security and defense. The legislation, which passed narrowly through Congress, also enacts substantial cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. From an international perspective, the bill is noted for its potential to add more than $3 trillion to the U.S. national debt, a figure highlighted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Democrats have strongly opposed the measure, framing it as a giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of working families. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new tax and spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security, the legislation does not actually do so. Instead, the bill introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older within certain income thresholds, which applies to all income, not just Social Security benefits. Policy experts note this is far from a complete repeal of the tax, and because of congressional rules, a full elimination was not possible within this bill. The measure primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does little for low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. (not investment advice)</p>

The 887-page legislation imposes new work requirements and eligibility checks for Medicaid, which could cause millions to lose coverage, and shifts some costs of the SNAP food assistance program to states. It also provides over $120 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, and largely terminates clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change. These animals undertake a massive annual migration in the Southern Ocean, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, getting fat, and then sinking deep into the ocean to burn that fat. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million gasoline-powered cars. The study highlights a previously underestimated natural carbon pump, emphasizing the crucial role these small organisms play in regulating the global climate.</p>

The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the probate system by monitoring a public list of unclaimed estates and then producing forged wills naming themselves as heirs. These fake documents have been used to claim properties and other assets, often undervaluing the estates to evade inheritance tax. Despite clear signs of forgery, victims and legitimate heir-finders have struggled to get authorities to investigate, revealing a critical vulnerability in the digitized system.</p>

The top 1% of households in states like Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas are projected to see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000.

          <p>President Trump celebrated a significant legislative achievement by signing a massive tax-and-spending package into law during a White House Fourth of July event. The bill extends tax cuts, particularly benefiting wealthier Americans, while imposing new restrictions on social programs like Medicaid and food stamps. It also allocates substantial new funding for immigration enforcement to support the administration's mass deportation goals. Immigrant rights organizations have condemned the bill, describing it as a "blank check" to terrorize communities, while supporters herald it as a pro-growth measure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany secured a 2-0 victory over Poland in their opening match of the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, but the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback, who has a history of two prior ACL injuries, left the pitch in tears during the first half after injuring her knee. Goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller sealed the win for the eight-time champions. However, the team now faces an anxious wait for MRI results to determine the extent of Gwinn's injury and her availability for the rest of the tournament.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks while giving preferential treatment to American citizens for permits and lotteries. The order states that revenue from the higher fees will be used for park infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the management and storytelling within the national park system. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs established under previous administrations.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and China are highlighting fractures within Global South-based alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS. Both organizations require consensus for decision-making, a rule that frequently brings the competing ambitions of the two regional powers into conflict. A recent SCO meeting of defense chiefs failed to produce a joint statement due to disagreements over language related to terrorism, underscoring the challenge India poses to China's assumed leadership role. This dynamic complicates the ability of these blocs to present a united front on the global stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a dramatic five-run victory over India in a last-ball thriller at The Oval, keeping the T20 series alive. Defending a total of 171, England held their nerve as bowler Lauren Bell secured the final wicket with India needing six runs to win. The match featured a remarkable momentum shift, as England collapsed from a dominant 137-0 to 171-9, thanks to half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge. A fiery spell from England's Lauren Filer then turned the tide during India's chase, setting up a tense finish.</p>
