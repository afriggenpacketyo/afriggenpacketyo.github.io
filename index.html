          <p>President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met at the White House to address ongoing trade tensions, including tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump has previously criticized Canada's trade practices and even suggested making Canada the 51st state. Carney, who recently won an election fueled by an anti-Trump platform, has vowed to fight for the best deal for Canada and has warned against American dominance. The historically friendly relationship between the two countries is currently strained, making this meeting crucial for easing tariffs and improving relations.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's new chancellor, but only after failing to secure a majority in the first round of voting, an unprecedented event in German politics. Merz, chairman of the CDU, eventually received 325 votes in the second round, with 289 MPs voting against him. The initial failure raised questions about his support within the coalition, particularly due to disagreements over immigration and public debt policies. Merz plans to meet with key allies and US President Trump to stabilize his chancellorship internationally.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a drop due to lowered guidance from companies like Ford, Marriott, Mattel, and Clorox, citing tariffs and macro uncertainties. The Federal Reserve is also beginning its two-day May meeting, with Trump's tariff policies causing uncertainty about whether to hold steady rates or lower them to address weakened economic growth. Dover has agreed to acquire Sikora for 550 million euros, while Coterra shares fell despite decent earnings. (not investment advice)</p>
