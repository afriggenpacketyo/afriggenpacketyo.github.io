          <p>Hurricane Erick, a Category 3 storm, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast in Oaxaca, bringing sustained winds of 125 mph and heavy rain. The hurricane, which had briefly reached Category 4 strength, is the first Pacific Category 3 hurricane to hit Mexico in June. President Claudia Sheinbaum reported damage mainly to the coast of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, with affected municipalities experiencing hospital flooding, river overflows, and landslides. While there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries, the storm is expected to weaken as it moves inland, though life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides remain a threat in steep terrain. The hurricane formed as a tropical storm early Tuesday and rapidly intensified before making landfall. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund President Donald Trump's appeal in the $83 million defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's request for Justice Department lawyers to represent him, stemming from Carroll's accusation that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s, an allegation he denies. The DOJ had argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, justifying their representation, but the court disagreed. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24, adding another layer to the ongoing legal battle.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts murder retrial. Jurors, after four days of deliberation, acquitted Read of the most serious charges but convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and the second trial included extensive testimony and scrutiny of evidence.</p>

          <p>The principal of Dundee University and two senior members of its governing body have resigned following a critical report on the financial mismanagement that led to a £22 million government bailout. The report cited poor financial judgment, weak governance, and the spending of ringfenced money as key factors in the university's financial crisis. It also noted a significant drop in overseas student recruitment and a failure to address the resulting budget shortfall. The report criticized a lack of openness and challenge within the university's leadership, with allegations of an overbearing leadership style and resistance to difficult conversations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on the potential risks and benefits of military action against Fordo, Iran's secure nuclear site, viewing it as a necessary measure due to the risk of rapid weapons production.

The U.K. is actively seeking a diplomatic resolution, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to present an offer to Iran.

          <p>Social Security is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, potentially leading to a 20% reduction in monthly benefits. The updated forecast, outlined in the Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report, attributes the change partly to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees. Advocacy groups are urging Congress to act swiftly to address the program's financial challenges, either by raising revenue or adjusting benefits. The report also notes that Medicare faces a financial crunch in 2033, potentially impacting its ability to cover 100% of benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old girl was airlifted from South Carolina's Hilton Head Island after she was bitten by a shark, authorities said. The girl was bitten in the waters off Hilton Head's Sea Pines on Tuesday, authorities said. Hilton Head Island Fire Rescue said in a statement she had sustained "a leg injury consistent with lacerations typically associated with a shark bite." Beachgoers said the attacks on the two young girls are an unnerving start to the summer. Unprovoked shark attacks are rare, but they do happen, researchers say.</p>

The agreement aims to end the fighting and potentially bring billions of dollars of American investment into the region, which is rich in minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. However, critics are skeptical of the deal's success, as the M23 militia, a key player in the conflict, is not a signatory.

          <p>The author argues for the importance of public pools in America, highlighting their benefits for mental, physical, and social health. Pools are described as essential for mood-boosting exercise and providing a sense of buoyancy and embrace. Historically, public pools served as community hubs, but desegregation led to their decline as suburbanites retreated to private pools. The author advocates for revitalizing public pools as resource-intensive endeavors that would promote health, happiness, and community, especially during increasingly hot summers.</p>

The UK possesses strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base, RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, and naval presence in the Gulf.

          <p>As a San Francisco federal appeals court reviews the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, immigration enforcement has intensified. The Trump administration attributes the stepped-up raids to the city's policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Advocacy groups report that ICE operations are becoming faster and agents are sometimes in plainclothes, leading to widespread fear and confusion. A settlement requires ICE personnel in the Los Angeles region to wear more prominent insignia, but this only applies to ICE, not other federal agencies involved in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>UNCTAD warns that international investment in 2025 has turned negative due to changes in global trade policy and tariff uncertainty. Trade tensions have led to downward revisions in indicators of foreign direct investment (FDI), with moderate growth expectations disappearing. Manufacturing investments, which had seen a positive trend, are now stalled due to tariffs. Between $100 and $200 billion of value in projects is at risk, with potential long-term consequences.
