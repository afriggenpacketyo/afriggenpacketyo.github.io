          <p>Three Republican-led states—West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio—are sending hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. This deployment supports the Trump administration's federal initiative to address crime and homelessness in the capital. The move has been framed as an effort to restore order, though city officials note that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The increased federal presence has sparked protests from residents concerned about a potential overreach of power and the militarization of the city.</p>

          <p>Since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" migrant agreement, over 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one person with a valid asylum claim. The continued crossings, including a report of a "mega dinghy" capable of holding over 100 people, highlight the ongoing challenges facing the UK government's efforts to control illegal immigration. The effectiveness of the deal remains uncertain as removals to France have not yet begun.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article reflects on how personal life experiences can profoundly change one's appreciation for art, particularly Renaissance masterpieces. The author recounts moving from youthful cynicism and a preference for abstract art to a deep connection with works depicting motherhood and suffering after experiencing trauma and pregnancy. The piece connects the historical devotion of women to paintings like Piero della Francesca's 'Madonna del Parto' with a modern understanding of art's power to resonate with complex human emotions. It argues that maturity and life events unlock new layers of meaning in classical works.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents have fled Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood following days of intense Israeli bombardment, which the local Hamas-run municipality describes as a "catastrophic" situation. The Israeli military plans to forcibly displace a million people to camps in the south, a move condemned by the UN Security Council. Simultaneously, a general strike is planned in Israel to protest the government's occupation plan, with families of hostages arguing it endangers those held by Hamas. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen, with reports of widespread malnutrition and deaths.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to a strike by Air Canada's 10,000 flight attendants, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration. The work stoppage, which began less than 12 hours prior, had already stranded over 100,000 travelers during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited economic risks as the reason for the intervention, a move the union condemned as a violation of their right to strike. The action aims to restore flight operations, though disruptions are expected to continue for several days.</p>

          <p>A cold case detective captured the notorious Phoenix "canal killer" through an elaborate undercover sting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona at festivals. Believing he was applying for a security job, Miller met with a detective, who arranged to covertly collect his DNA from a water glass. The DNA matched evidence from the 1990s murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, leading to Miller's arrest, conviction, and eventual death sentence in 2023.</p>

The deal, which critics argue sets a dangerous precedent of selling export control licenses, has raised legal questions about whether it constitutes an unconstitutional tax on exports. The move highlights a shift in U.S. tech policy towards China, balancing national security concerns with transactional dealmaking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle known as the "85th percentile rule" is being reconsidered by some states as the primary method for setting speed limits. The rule suggests that the speed limit should be set at or near the speed that 85% of drivers travel at or below, effectively letting drivers determine the speed. Critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians. Amid rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors, like pedestrian safety and crash frequency, should also be considered.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that features a single, rotating "scissor wing," an idea once explored by NASA. The innovative design allows the wing to sit perpendicular to the fuselage for efficient lift during takeoff and subsonic flight. As the aircraft accelerates, the wing pivots, swinging to a 45-degree angle at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and finally aligning parallel with the fuselage at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5. In this final configuration, the entire vehicle functions as a "waverider," optimizing performance.</p>
