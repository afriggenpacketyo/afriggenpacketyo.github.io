          <p>Germany's coalition government has agreed to create a National Security Council (NSR) to centralize information and enable more decisive action during crises. The move, ending decades of debate, is a response to the need for faster decision-making, highlighted by events like the withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chaired by the chancellor, the council will consolidate expertise from various ministries to proactively shape security policy, replacing the existing Federal Security Council. While the NSR will not have unilateral decision-making power, it aims to prevent delays and strengthen Germany's role in European security matters.</p>

          <p>A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska concluded with friendly remarks but no concrete agreement to end the war in Ukraine. Trump described the talks as "extremely productive," while Putin framed the conflict as a matter of Russian security, a narrative some observers fear Trump may adopt. Throughout the joint press appearance, Trump appeared deferential to the Russian leader and did not criticize Russia's aggression, instead stating it is now up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to negotiate with Moscow. The lack of a clear outcome raises questions about the future of U.S. policy and Western support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Bob Simpson, a former Australian Test cricket captain and transformative coach, has passed away at the age of 89. Simpson had a distinguished playing career, scoring nearly 5,000 runs in 62 Tests and making a notable comeback as captain at age 41 during the World Series Cricket era. As a coach starting in 1986, he is credited with reviving the Australian team, leading them to a 1987 World Cup victory and laying the groundwork for an era of global dominance. He mentored a golden generation of players, including Shane Warne and Steve Waugh, leaving an enduring legacy on the sport.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump reported making significant progress but stopped short of announcing a ceasefire deal for Ukraine. In subsequent phone calls with NATO leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump's advice to his Ukrainian counterpart was bluntly stated as, "Make the deal." During an interview, Trump reiterated that while many points were agreed upon, a few significant items remain unresolved, placing the onus on Zelenskyy and European nations to finalize negotiations. The president deferred considering consequences like sanctions, indicating a trilateral meeting between himself, Putin, and Zelenskyy is still planned.</p>

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are publicly voicing concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, leading to calls for Beijing to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar assets. While noting that U.S. Treasuries have not yet defaulted, the researchers described their growth as unsustainable in a central bank-supervised publication. China has already been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, with its current holdings at the lowest point since 2009. The article suggests a strategy of gradually adjusting these holdings while increasing reserves of gold and other strategic resources to mitigate financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Alaska summit suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin successfully managed the optics of the meeting, receiving a deferential welcome from U.S. President Donald Trump. The article highlights the pageantry of the event, including a red carpet and a ride in the presidential limousine, which served to restore Putin's status on the world stage despite his international isolation. During the brief press conference, Putin was able to frame the narrative, while Trump appeared unusually subdued. In a subsequent interview, Trump revealed Putin reinforced his claims of a rigged 2020 election, indicating the Russian leader effectively appealed to Trump's personal grievances.</p>

          <p>The meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska yielded several key observations despite the lack of a concrete peace deal for Ukraine. Firstly, the warm reception and red carpet for Putin marked a significant victory for the isolated Russian leader, welcoming him back to the world stage. Secondly, the summit ended without a ceasefire agreement, as Putin reiterated maximalist demands amounting to Ukrainian capitulation. Trump's subsequent public statements were notably vague and did not mention Ukraine directly, nor did he follow through on threats of consequences. Finally, Putin extended an invitation for a future meeting in Moscow, leaving the path forward uncertain.</p>

          <p>An internal review has revealed that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," spent six months meticulously planning his escape from an Arkansas prison. Hardin told investigators he exploited "very lax" security in the prison kitchen where he worked to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform.
