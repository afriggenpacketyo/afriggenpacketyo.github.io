          <p>Canada Goose's stock experienced a significant increase after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings surpassed analysts' estimates, despite the company pulling its fiscal year 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade and consumer spending patterns as reasons for this decision, but expressed confidence in the brand's strength and financial position. The article also notes that the majority of Canada Goose's units are made in Canada and compliant with US trade agreements, minimizing the impact of tariffs, and that the company is trying to diversify its imports.

          <p>Despite Israel's announcement of easing its blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza, little to no food, fuel, or medicine has reached Palestinians, according to this New York Times article. The article notes that while dozens of trucks have crossed into Gaza, the United Nations has been unable to move them to warehouses inside Gaza due to lack of Israeli permission. This has left Palestinians waiting, facing a "critical risk of famine," with the situation igniting international criticism of Israel's campaign against Hamas.</p>
