          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intent to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, which the Department of Justice is already investigating. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, immediately countered that Trump lacks the legal authority for such an action and would not resign, hiring a high-profile attorney to fight the unprecedented move. This dramatic escalation of Trump's attacks on the central bank's independence could lead to a federal court challenge and potentially reshape the Fed's governing board if his actions are upheld. The controversy highlights the ongoing tension over monetary policy decisions and their impact on market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines announced 20 new routes, many directly targeting Spirit Airlines' major markets, as its struggling rival faces severe financial challenges and a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. Frontier's CEO, Barry Biffle, indicated the airline aims to capture a significant portion of Spirit's customer base if it fails, positioning Frontier to become the country's largest budget carrier. Both airlines have contended with evolving customer tastes, domestic overcapacity, and increased operational costs, but Spirit's financial health has become particularly dire. This aggressive expansion by Frontier underscores the intense competitive pressures and consolidation dynamics within the ultra-low-cost airline sector.</p>

          <p>A Maryland resident who recently traveled to El Salvador has been diagnosed with New World screwworm, marking the first reported U.S. case directly linked to a country experiencing an active outbreak. Federal health officials confirmed the diagnosis, noting the individual has fully recovered and there is no evidence of the parasite transmitting to other people or animals. This rare flesh-eating parasite, typically endemic to South America and the Caribbean, lays its eggs in open wounds, with the resulting larvae consuming flesh. While the risk to the public remains low, the case underscores the importance of preventing insect bites in tropical areas and keeping wounds clean and covered.</p>

The model's architecture showcases significant synergy between domestically designed software and hardware, utilizing advanced 8-bit data formats like FP8 and UE8M0 to boost AI training and inference efficiency. These formats reduce memory and bandwidth needs by up to 75%, making them vital for cutting hardware requirements. This strategic development is considered a "key pillar" for China to establish a robust, coordinated ecosystem across hardware, software, and applications, particularly amidst ongoing technological competition.

          <p>China is preparing to unveil a new-generation, lighter tank at an upcoming military parade, with its design reflecting lessons gleaned from the Ukraine war. This medium-weight tank, notably lighter than the Type 99A main battle tank, incorporates advanced active protection systems, including the GL6 APS and a quad-faced phased array radar offering 360-degree threat detection. Military analysts believe this development signifies Beijing's evolving approach to tank warfare, emphasizing enhanced survivability against drone and missile attacks. The tank's characteristics also suggest it is better suited for complex landing operations, such as those potentially targeting Taiwan, addressing vulnerabilities observed in modern conflicts.</p>

          <p>A significant number of homeowners are choosing to pull their properties off the market instead of reducing asking prices, reflecting widespread frustration over stagnant sales activity. Recent data indicates a 38% increase in delistings since the start of 2025 and a 48% rise from a year ago, pointing towards a potential deadlock in the housing market. While housing inventory has grown, elevated prices and high mortgage rates continue to dissuade prospective buyers, resulting in flat pending home sales. Many current homeowners, often locked into advantageous mortgage rates, are unwilling to sell at prices they deem unsatisfactory, maintaining expectations from the pandemic-era boom.

While side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, led to some discontinuations, the drug also significantly lowered hemoglobin A1c levels, with most patients no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria.

          <p>Rare earth prices have climbed to a two-year high, primarily influenced by MP Materials' decision to cease shipments of rare earth concentrate to China. This strategic move by the Western Hemisphere's largest rare earth producer signifies a notable shift in global supply chain dynamics for these critical minerals. The price surge reflects both increased demand and growing concerns over supply security outside of China, which has historically held a dominant position in the rare earth market. This development is poised to have far-reaching implications across various industries, including electronics, renewable energy, and defense, as nations seek to diversify their sources and reduce reliance on single suppliers.

          <p>The University of Chicago's recent decision to reduce PhD admissions in seven humanities departments and entirely freeze others, including classics, has ignited significant concern among academics. Citing "evolving fiscal realities" and the broader political climate, many scholars view this as a grave threat to the preservation of humanistic knowledge, especially in smaller fields and languages. Professors argue that the implications extend far beyond the job market for academics, warning that a decline in the training of humanists could result in the irreversible loss of entire domains of human learning. This controversial move has prompted faculty members to advocate for a unified, division-wide pause rather than targeted cuts, emphasizing the intrinsic value of these disciplines.</p>

His plan for nearly €44bn in cuts has already triggered public protests and a notable decline in the CAC-40 share index.

Rather than adopting more complex organizational systems, the most effective remedy is to embrace the counterintuitive: prioritize genuine rest and strategically eliminate tasks that do not serve core goals.

While labor market integration shows positive trends, with increasing employment and average incomes, notable gender disparities in German language acquisition continue. Public sentiment in Germany has evolved, reflecting heightened skepticism regarding refugee intake and growing concerns about welfare state burdens and potential social conflicts.
