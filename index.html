          <p>India's securities regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has temporarily barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street from its markets. The regulatory body has accused the firm of engaging in widespread manipulation of the benchmark Nifty 50 index through a complex trading strategy designed to profit from options. In an interim order, SEBI has also frozen approximately $566 million in alleged illegal gains and directed banks to prevent debits from Jane Street's accounts without permission. Jane Street has disputed the allegations, asserting its commitment to regulatory compliance as it prepares to engage further with the Indian authorities on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian medical device company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system to the Chinese market, making China one of the first countries to receive the technology. The device functions by bypassing damaged inner ear hair cells and directly stimulating the auditory nerve, offering a solution for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. According to the company's chief technology officer, the implant is most effective for users for whom traditional hearing aids are no longer sufficient. The launch through Hainan province and Hong Kong signifies a rapid entry into a key global market for advanced medical technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty on charges including first-degree sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The case stemmed from a 2021 incident where McLemore assaulted a 21-year-old woman who prosecutors argued was incapacitated and unable to consent after a party at a teammate's home. While the defense claimed the encounter was consensual, the prosecution presented evidence of the woman's incapacitation and her testimony of freezing in terror during the assault. McLemore, who played for several NBA teams including the Portland Trail Blazers, is scheduled for sentencing following the verdict.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a significant overnight drone attack on Kyiv, striking multiple residential areas and injuring at least 14 people. Ukrainian air defenses were active for hours as explosions were heard across the capital, with fires breaking out in at least two districts. The Ukrainian Air Force also reported the use of a Kinzhal hypersonic missile and other ballistic missiles in the assault. This attack comes as President Trump comments on pausing some U.S. weapons shipments, stating his predecessor had depleted U.S. stockpiles, a situation Ukrainian President Zelenskyy hopes to discuss with him soon.</p>

          <p>A family vacation for a North Texas family turned tragic when a 42-year-old man was severely injured by a boat propeller while snorkeling in the Bahamas. Brent Slough, a former Army Ranger, was struck by a speeding boat just 20 feet from shore, suffering life-threatening injuries that nearly severed his lower body. His teenage daughter had to rescue him, and the boat involved allegedly fled the scene without stopping to render aid. Slough was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for intensive care, facing multiple fractures and deep gashes, while his family seeks to find the individuals responsible for the hit-and-run incident.</p>

          <p>Veteran advocates, military families, and legal scholars are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles to quell protests threatens democratic norms. Speakers at a virtual news conference argued that the move pushes the military dangerously close to violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars troops from civilian law enforcement. They expressed concern that service members are being placed in a role for which they are not trained, pitting them against American citizens and eroding public trust. Critics described the situation as 'making America militarized again' and a dangerous precedent for the use of military force on U.S. soil.</p>

          <h2>Data Shows Sharpest Growth in ICE Detention is Among Immigrants with No Criminal Convictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the Deportation Data Project reveals that the fastest-growing segment of the ICE detention population consists of immigrants with no criminal convictions. According to the analysis, nearly half of the 56,000 people currently in detention have no criminal record, and this group's numbers have nearly doubled since May. This trend appears to contradict statements from administration officials that the focus of enforcement is on violent criminals. The data suggests a broader immigration crackdown, impacting individuals like a Guatemalan pastor who had lived in the U.S. for 30 years without a criminal record before being detained and deported.</p>

Chilean authorities stopped 19-year-old Ethan Guo, alleging he submitted a false flight plan and deviated from it, which activated safety alerts. He has been charged with violating Chile's aeronautical code after landing on the island, which is claimed by Chile. Guo, who has gained over a million online followers, was on the final leg of his quest to become the first pilot to complete solo flights across all seven continents in his Cessna aircraft.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, has left seven people unaccounted for and two others injured. The blasts at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility in Esparto triggered a large fire that spread to surrounding grasslands, burning approximately 80 acres. Family members have identified some of the missing, including three relatives who were working at the facility. Local officials have issued evacuation orders for the surrounding area, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has been called to assist in the investigation into the cause of the explosions.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Republican Derrick Van Orden faced backlash after sharing and then deleting a social media post that appeared to celebrate the negative impacts of President Trump's new tax bill. Van Orden had responded with 'YES!' to a post detailing how the legislation would cause 17 million people to lose healthcare and 3 million to lose food assistance. He later claimed the post was an error and that he intended to respond to a different White House statement. Observers remained skeptical, suggesting the deletion was a reaction to criticism over the post's perceived cruelty, which starkly highlighted the bill's controversial cuts to social programs.</p>

          <p>Recent staffing cuts at the National Park Service are raising safety concerns as the summer visitor season peaks, with examples like unguarded lifeguard towers at Assateague Island National Seashore. According to the National Parks Conservation Association, the NPS has lost 24% of its permanent staff since the Trump administration took office, and thousands of seasonal positions remain unfilled. This is attributed to a federal hiring freeze and budget cuts, which critics say are creating dangerous conditions. A former paramedic and local mayor expressed fear that the lack of lifeguards puts every visitor to the popular Maryland beach in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Trump's signature legislative package, a massive bill that enacts deep tax and spending cuts while increasing defense and immigration enforcement funding. The measure, dubbed the 'big, beautiful bill,' passed by a narrow 218-214 vote after a marathon session where Republican leaders overcame internal opposition. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance due to cuts to Medicaid and ACA programs. President Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law on July 4th. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public 'declaration of dissent' critical of the agency's current policies. The employees' letter argued that the EPA is failing its mission to protect human health and the environment under the Trump administration. In response, the EPA accused the signatories of 'unlawfully undermining' the administration's agenda and placed them on a temporary, paid, non-duty status pending an investigation. This rare public criticism from agency staff highlights deep internal divisions over the EPA's direction on issues like climate change and pollution regulation.</p>

As a pivotal figure in hip-hop, Combs still retains a base of support, but many in the industry and public may find the details of the case hard to overlook.
