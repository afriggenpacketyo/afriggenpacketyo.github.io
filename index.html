          <h2>Chinese Exports Plummet Amidst Rising US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 17:16:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant decline in April due to the imposition of steep tariffs by the Trump administration, making it prohibitively expensive for many U.S. retailers to import goods from China. In response, China retaliated with its own levies on American goods, leading to a disruption in traditional trade patterns as Chinese exports shifted towards Southeast Asian countries. While President Trump has hinted at potentially reducing tariffs, even a lowered rate would still pose financial challenges for U.S. businesses and consumers already facing economic pressures. Experts suggest that trade negotiations could lead to a de-escalation, but the long-term impact on the global economy remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez are set to return to court for a resentencing hearing, as a judge considers a newly completed risk assessment requested by Gov. Gavin Newsom as part of a clemency bid. The assessment indicates that the brothers pose a moderate risk to the community if released, revealing alleged prison violations such as possessing illegal cellphones and engaging in drug-related activities. Despite these findings, defense attorneys are proceeding with the resentencing hearing, presenting a reduced witness list, while the district attorney seeks to keep the brothers incarcerated, highlighting conflicting views on their rehabilitation and potential for release. The case has gained momentum after the previous district attorney supported resentencing, citing the brothers' rehabilitation and the impact of abuse on their crimes.</p>

          <p>Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, was arrested while protesting at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, along with members of Congress. The arrest occurred after Baraka allegedly trespassed and ignored warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to leave the facility. The city of Newark has previously raised concerns about the facility's safety protocols, while the Department of Homeland Security asserts that it has proper permitting and houses undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes. The article notes that the governor of New Jersey criticized Baraka's arrest and called for his immediate release, while a Homeland Security official alleged the elected officials were trying to "storm" the facility.</p>

          <p>President Trump has touted the new trade pact with the U.K. as a significant achievement, but experts are skeptical, pointing out that a 10% tariff remains on U.K. imports, higher than pre-Trump levels. This baseline tariff, while lower than some others, could still burden U.S. businesses and consumers with increased costs, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and slower hiring. Economists warn that ongoing uncertainty over tariffs could hinder businesses' ability to plan and invest, despite potential relief from new trade deals. The article notes that the U.K. is a smaller trading partner compared to China, where tariff negotiations are also underway, further underscoring the potential economic impact of these trade policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. ambassador to Zambia, Michael Gonzales, emotionally announced a $50 million cut in aid for medications and medical supplies after discovering widespread theft of donated drugs. An investigation revealed that 95% of pharmacies were selling stolen drugs, including those provided by the U.S. for free. Gonzales expressed frustration with the Zambian government's lack of action to stop the theft and hold culprits accountable, prompting the difficult decision to reduce aid. The cut in aid is distinct from previous administration changes and aims to give Zambia time to find alternative solutions, though experts warn of dire consequences if alternative funding cannot be secured.</p>

          <p>A brief radar outage at an air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, which guides planes at Newark Liberty International Airport, caused further disruptions at the already troubled airport. The 90-second outage, attributed to the same telecom and software issues as a previous incident, led to flight delays and a ground delay program. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced a plan to modernize the air traffic control system, but the latest outage intensifies pressure on officials to act.

While Trump has expressed interest in the idea, he has also backtracked, and House Speaker Mike Johnson opposes it. The issue is creating a rift between traditional Republicans who oppose tax increases and populist nationalists who see it as a way to generate revenue and ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. The debate centers on extending the 2017 tax cuts, which expire at the end of the year, and whether to offset the cost with spending cuts or tax increases on the wealthy.</p>
