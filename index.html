          <p>President Trump alleged that former FBI Director James Comey was inciting violence against him with an Instagram post containing the numbers "8647," interpreted by Trump's supporters as a call to "86" or eliminate the 47th president. Trump made these claims in a Fox News interview, following an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. Comey denied any violent intent, stating he posted a picture of seashells he found on a beach walk and was unaware of the numerical association with violence, leading him to delete the post. Optimism that this conflict will de-escalate and not lead to actual violence or further division is somewhat limited.</p>

A spokesperson for Nvidia clarified that the company is not sending any GPU designs to China.

          <p>Kerri Pegg, a 42-year-old prison governor, received a nine-year sentence for engaging in a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, a drug-dealing gang leader. Pegg, once a rising star in the Prison Service, abused her position by helping Saunderson secure day release. The sentencing judge condemned her betrayal of public trust. During a police raid on Pegg's home, authorities found Saunderson's DNA on a toothbrush and discovered that Saunderson had gifted her a Â£12,000 Mercedes C-class car funded by proceeds from amphetamine sales. Saunderson had used aliases from the TV shows Breaking Bad and The Sopranos in communications with other criminals.</p>

A notable development was Trump's diplomatic engagement with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy. Trump also announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria to support its rebuilding efforts. While the White House touted deals worth billions for U.S. companies, details remained sparse.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike after a midnight deadline expired, causing a complete shutdown of rail service and inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. The dispute between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) centers on pay raises, with the union arguing that competition pays more and the cost of living has increased. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service, but warns it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate the impacts, and commuters are advised to work from home if possible.</p>

Revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, exceeding analyst forecasts, although sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite ongoing global uncertainties, Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert noted the company's robust overall performance, fueled by remarkable growth in jewelry and retail.

While the monthly income may not cover all expenses, it can provide financial security and protect against longevity risk.

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are warning of dire consequences if the Trump administration continues to cut funding for worker safety programs, particularly those related to black lung disease. Retired miner John Robinson described the bleak reality of living with black lung and the increased risks miners face due to deeper mining depths and exposure to toxic silica. Federal cuts to the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are seen as a major threat to miners' health and safety, with workers and politicians rallying to protect mining protections.</p>

          <p>Hadi Matar, the man convicted of trying to stab Salman Rushdie to death, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Matar claimed Rushdie was a hypocrite. The judge delivered the sentence after an hourlong hearing. Rushdie had been living under a religious edict calling for his death since 1989. The jury found Matar guilty in February. The prosecution called several witnesses, while the defense called none. This is a developing story.</p>
