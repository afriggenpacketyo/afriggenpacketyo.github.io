          <p>A majority of a Brazilian Supreme Court panel has voted to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro on charges related to attempting a coup to unlawfully remain in power after his 2022 election loss. With three of the five justices voting for conviction, the verdict is secured, though sentencing is still pending and could result in decades of prison time. The trial has deeply divided Brazil and drawn international attention, including from U.S. President Trump, who called the conviction "very bad for Brazil." Bolsonaro's legal team has announced plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, this article examines the security arrangements at the outdoor event at Utah Valley University. It notes the presence of six university police officers and Kirk's private security team, questioning if the open-air venue created vulnerabilities. Security experts suggest that the low-crime history of the area may have influenced the threat assessment and that additional measures like drones could have provided crucial surveillance of surrounding rooftops. The piece highlights the challenges of securing public figures at outdoor events with uncontrolled access points.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's reaction to Charlie Kirk's assassination, arguing that his immediate blame of "radical left political violence" is factually incomplete and politically motivated. The piece contends that while political violence is a growing concern across the spectrum, data indicates that far-right extremism has been the more frequent source of domestic terrorism in recent decades. It critiques Trump for omitting right-wing violence from his narrative, suggesting he is using the tragedy to create a climate of fear and advance a political agenda that ignores his own history of inflammatory rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her role in a bribery scheme. She was convicted of accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. While prosecutors sought a longer sentence, the judge considered her ongoing cancer treatments and set a future surrender date. During her sentencing, she expressed accountability and stated she was wrong about her husband, who is currently serving an 11-year sentence for his own conviction in the case.</p>

Under the agreement, the U.S. and Japan will initially split profits from these projects equally until Japan's investment is fully recouped. Afterward, the profit share will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. This arrangement is part of a broader deal that sets new tariffs on Japanese goods and aims to boost domestic American manufacturing in strategic sectors like nuclear power and pharmaceuticals.

          <p>Oracle's stock fell 6% after a record-breaking rally, as investor enthusiasm was dampened by concerns over its customer concentration. The dip followed a Wall Street Journal report that a significant portion of Oracle's massive projected cloud revenue comes from a single client: OpenAI, which is set to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years. While Oracle's announced multi-billion dollar contracts initially caused the stock to soar, the revelation has led analysts to temper their excitement, questioning the sustainability of growth heavily dependent on one partnership.</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over the national high school curriculum, with students and reformers questioning the heavy focus on classic authors like Goethe. Critics argue that the required reading lists are dominated by white male authors and lack relevance for a diverse student body, where over 25% have immigrant backgrounds. While some educators advocate for including more contemporary and diverse voices to engage students, others stress the importance of classics for understanding history and developing critical thinking. The discussion highlights a generational and cultural tension within Germany's education system.</p>
