          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has ended its broad authorization for COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S., now only clearing shots for individuals at higher risk of severe illness. This significant policy shift, announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, could complicate vaccine access for millions of healthy adults and raises questions about whether insurance plans will still cover them. The new limited authorizations mark a substantial departure from previous U.S. vaccine policy, which recommended an annual COVID shot for all Americans aged 6 months and up. The article highlights potential challenges in public health policy and vaccine accessibility.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares surged over 8% after the company announced it would revert to its original, iconic logo, abandoning a controversial redesign. This decision followed widespread criticism from social media users, who labeled the new design 'generic' and 'soulless,' and even public comments from President Donald Trump, who urged the company to admit its mistake. The stock recovered losses incurred when the new logo was initially revealed, indicating strong customer and investor approval for the return to classic branding.

          <p>A gunman opened fire at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a service marking the first week of school, resulting in the deaths of two children, aged 8 and 10, and injuries to 17 others, including 14 children, two critically. The shooter, described as being in his early 20s, acted alone and died from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing a rifle through church windows toward the congregants. Police Chief Brian O'Hara condemned the incident as an 'incomprehensible' act of cruelty and cowardice. The article underscores the profound grief and outrage in the community, with local leaders calling for urgent action against gun violence following this horrific event.</p>

The party still aims to deport 600,000 people, primarily targeting adults without children, and plans to 'disapply' international treaties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest possible eligibility age, presents several significant financial risks, including a permanent reduction in monthly benefits by approximately 6.7% for each year before one's full retirement age. This decision also results in forfeiting valuable delayed retirement credits, which could otherwise increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and can substantially reduce potential survivor benefits for a spouse. The article strongly advises exploring alternatives such as tapping retirement savings, purchasing annuities, leveraging home equity, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize long-term financial security (not investment advice).</p>
