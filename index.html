          <p>Chinese renewable energy company Envision Energy has launched the first phase of the world's largest green hydrogen and ammonia facility in Inner Mongolia. The plant is designed to produce 320,000 tonnes of green ammonia annually, with a goal of scaling up to 1.5 million tonnes by 2028. This development is a significant step in China's strategy to decarbonize its industrial sectors and establish a leading position in the global clean fuel market. Exports from the new facility are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>The UK and France have established a new migrant returns agreement, which UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper asserts is legally robust. The pilot program involves the UK returning migrants who cross the Channel in small boats to France, and in exchange, accepting a legally processed asylum seeker from France. The government believes this "one-in, one-out" system will deter illegal crossings, though critics have labeled it a "gimmick." The deal follows record numbers of small boat arrivals in the UK this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to take effect on August 1. In a letter, President Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl and existing trade barriers as primary reasons for the levy. He warned that any retaliatory tariffs from Ottawa would result in further increases to the duty. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated his government will continue to defend its workers and businesses while working toward the new deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The body of a teenage boy has been found in Powell's Pool at Sutton Park in Birmingham after he was reported missing in the water. West Midlands Police confirmed the discovery and stated that his death is not being treated as suspicious.

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of decline and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the shrinkage primarily to a drop in manufacturing, particularly in car-making and pharmaceuticals, as well as weak retail sales. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "disappointing" but affirmed her commitment to stimulating economic growth. The data suggests a fragile outlook amid ongoing pressures on businesses and strained public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lord Robert Winston, a renowned IVF pioneer and Labour peer, has resigned his 60-year membership from the British Medical Association (BMA) over planned strikes by resident doctors. He argued that the five-day walkout, scheduled for late July over a pay dispute, is inappropriate at a time of national struggle and risks damaging public trust in the medical profession. The BMA is proceeding with the strike, stating the government has refused to negotiate on pay, which they claim is 20% lower in real terms than in 2008.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study by Princeton University has found that threats and harassment targeting local school officials in the U.S. have increased by 170% since the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers found that initial anger over mask mandates evolved into conflicts over cultural issues, including LGBTQ+ policies and diversity initiatives. The report, which surveyed over 820 officials, notes that the harassment affects individuals across the political spectrum. Many officials report being targeted by vitriolic emails, social media attacks, and even death threats.</p>

These structures blocked migratory routes, restricted water flow, and destroyed spawning grounds.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin layoffs, aiming to reduce its domestic workforce by approximately 15%, or around 1,800 positions. The move is part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration to streamline operations, cut redundant offices, and focus on diplomatic priorities. The cuts will be achieved through a combination of layoffs and voluntary departures. Critics and some department staff have expressed concern that the reductions could undermine the effectiveness of American diplomacy and demoralize the workforce.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is being hampered by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages, undermining the UK's warfighting capability. While acknowledging the F-35's superiority, the NAO described the £11 billion spent so far as a "disappointing return," noting the fleet's operational readiness is far below targets. The watchdog also estimated the total program cost could be over three times the Ministry of Defence's initial forecast, urging the MoD to prioritize resources more effectively.

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid boom in the adoption of electric heavy trucks, with sales jumping 175% in the first half of the year. This surge, driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging network, is significantly curbing the nation's diesel consumption and denting overall oil demand. The trend has surprised analysts, causing them to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak. The lower operating costs of electric trucks are making them an increasingly attractive commercial option. (not investment advice)</p>
