          <p>Ukraine reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a massive overnight Russian assault involving over 500 drones and missiles. Before his plane was damaged, Ustimenko successfully shot down seven aerial targets. He guided the failing aircraft away from residential areas but was unable to eject in time, leading to his death. The large-scale attack prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its own aircraft as a precaution, highlighting the escalating regional tensions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ordered an investigation and reiterated urgent calls for strengthened air defense systems.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News telephone survey reveals that 50 percent of Japanese voters hope Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition loses its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. The poll, conducted over the weekend, indicated that only 38.1 percent of respondents wish for the Liberal Democratic Party and its Komeito partner to maintain their majority. This sentiment emerges just weeks before the critical July 20 election. The results suggest significant public discontent and a potential shift in the political landscape, posing a major challenge to the current administration's stability and policy agenda.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was asked to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted inconsistencies and confusion regarding airline policies on smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these pouches in both carry-on and checked luggage, individual airlines determine their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping. However, policies for other major carriers like American and United are not clearly defined on their websites, leading to debate and uncertainty among travelers about what is permissible during flights.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing discussions about achieving European geopolitical independence, recent summits have instead highlighted the continent's perceived weakness on the global stage. This comes as Europe prepares for a significant diplomatic engagement with China. The article suggests that despite aspirations for strategic autonomy, particularly since the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, Europe is struggling to project a united and powerful front. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's comments about Europe needing to pay "in a BIG way" underscore the internal and external pressures challenging its quest for a more assertive international role.</p>

Many female content creators and influencers report facing a constant barrage of online harassment, stalking, and threats of sexual assault that can escalate into real-world violence. Activists argue that these dangers are rooted in patriarchal norms where women's visibility and independence are perceived as a threat to cultural and religious values. Despite the risks, many women continue to use social media for self-expression and professional opportunities, navigating a system where platform support and legal protections are often inadequate.</p>

          <p>A California court has sentenced Samuel Woodward to life in prison without parole for the 2018 murder of his former classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. The jury found Woodward guilty of first-degree murder and affirmed the hate crime enhancement, concluding he targeted Bernstein for being gay and Jewish. The trial revealed Woodward's ties to Atomwaffen, a violent neo-Nazi group. In response to the tragedy, Bernstein's parents founded "BlazeItForward," a kindness movement to counter the hate that led to their son's death.

With this investment, the French state becomes the largest shareholder, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, experts express skepticism about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing major disparities in scale, manufacturing, and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation has 650 satellites compared to Starlink's more than 7,000, suggesting its immediate success may lie in specialized government and enterprise sectors rather than the mass market.</p>

Key events to watch include ECB President Christine Lagarde's opening speech and the one-year anniversary of the Labour Party's rise to power in the U.K., which has been marked by economic challenges.

          <p>Quemoy, a group of islands administered by Taipei but located less than 10 kilometers from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. Despite its proximity to Xiamen, Beijing's influence is limited, and similarly, Taipei's control feels distant to the 130,000 residents. The island's current state highlights the complex and often contradictory dynamics of the region, demonstrating the practical limitations of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan in asserting their respective models of governance and influence.</p>

          <p>Five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, a treaty banning anti-personnel mines. The move is part of a strategy to bolster border security against a potential Russian attack by creating a deterrent minefield, described as a new "Iron Curtain." This plan is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end. While defense officials in countries like Lithuania call it a response to an "existential threat," human rights groups warn against using weapons that cause immense long-term harm.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During the outing, his four-seam fastball was clocked at 101.7 mph, the fastest pitch of his Major League Baseball career. Despite his strong performance on the mound, which included one strikeout and only one hit allowed, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats. The Dodgers ultimately lost the game 9-5, snapping their five-game winning streak, but Ohtani's developing pitching form remains a positive sign for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and swimming pools have gone into effect across France. The rules are part of a government initiative aimed at protecting the public, especially children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke and moving towards a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. Violators could face fines up to â‚¬700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban, which does not apply to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, comes as France continues to battle a high smoking rate, with over 30% of adults still smoking.</p>

          <p>A Church of England lay preacher in Leicester, Venessa Pinto, has been convicted of stalking after a prolonged campaign of harassment against a volunteer, Jay Hulme. The ordeal began after Hulme, who is gay, declined her romantic advances. Despite Hulme providing extensive evidence, his complaint was initially dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, who instead accused Hulme of witchcraft. The police response was also delayed, but Pinto was eventually arrested and pleaded guilty. The case has exposed significant failures in how both the Church and local police handled the serious and distressing allegations.</p>

          <p>A massive Republican spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by President Trump, cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate after a dramatic, late-night vote. The advancement came after leadership secured the votes of several conservative holdouts, including Sen. Ron Johnson who flipped his vote to yes. The senators reportedly received assurances regarding amendments on deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. The bill's passage was uncertain for hours, highlighting deep divisions within the party. Democrats are now forcing a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill, further delaying a final vote on the controversial legislation.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale parades to mark the culmination of LGBTQ+ Pride Month. This year's events are characterized by a defiant tone, mixing celebration with protest against recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender people. Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" in response to the challenging political climate. The parades also face new headwinds from a reduction in corporate sponsorships, as some companies pull back from diversity and inclusion initiatives amid shifting public sentiment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Civil servants in some regions of China are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and unpredictable local austerity campaigns. An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head recently announced a ban on eating out, reflecting a phenomenon known as "ceng ceng jia ma," where local authorities add extra layers of control on top of central government regulations. This lifestyle change, even if temporary, is prompted by the fear of violating ever-shifting rules designed to curb extravagance and enforce discipline among government employees. The measures highlight the pervasive and often arbitrary nature of anti-corruption efforts at the local level.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly begun arresting Iranians who have lived in the United States for decades, sparking fear within the Iranian American community. One case involves a 64-year-old woman who arrived in 1978, married a U.S. citizen, and regularly checked in with immigration officials for years before being detained at her New Orleans home. Advocacy groups express concern that ICE is rounding up Iranians regardless of individual threat levels, fueled by recent military tensions. The Department of Homeland Security has touted recent arrests of Iranians for immigration violations, intensifying worries about a broader deportation drive.</p>

          <p>A brush fire, named the Lake fire, broke out near Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County and quickly grew to 478 acres, prompting mandatory evacuations and road closures. The blaze, which started Saturday afternoon, forced over 100 people, including campers and beachgoers, to flee the area, with some being evacuated by boaters. Fire crews are battling the flames from the ground and air, but the fire remains at zero percent containment. While calmer winds and higher humidity are expected overnight, forecasters warn that gusty winds returning Sunday and Monday could challenge suppression efforts.

          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, held multiple phone discussions with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as the two countries attempt to resolve difficult issues in their trade relationship. A primary point of contention is the Trump administration's significant tariff increase on imported automobiles and auto parts, which Japan is urgently seeking to mitigate. The ongoing negotiations have yet to yield a breakthrough, with the U.S. showing no signs of backing down on its sector-based tariffs imposed on national security grounds. Akazawa has extended his stay in Washington to continue pursuing a beneficial agreement for both nations.</p>
