          <h2>Nissan Considers Closing Two Plants in Kanagawa Amid Restructuring</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its restructuring efforts after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants in question are the Oppama plant in Yokosuka, a pioneer in electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. in Hiratsuka, which manufactures commercial vehicles. Together, these plants account for about 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity, but have lower operating rates due to sluggish sales. Nissan has stated that this news is speculative and not based on official information, and the company has yet to hold talks with labor unions, parts makers, or municipalities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential mood changes associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, medications used for weight loss and diabetes management. While some studies suggest a link between these drugs and mental health complications like anxiety and depression, others attribute mood changes to genetic variations or the emotional impact of obesity and type 2 diabetes itself. Doctors emphasize the importance of monitoring patients for mood changes and taking a holistic approach to weight loss, offering mental health support alongside medication. They also stress that weight loss can positively impact mood, self-esteem, and overall well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former White House lawyers and foreign affairs experts are raising concerns about President Trump's acceptance of overseas gifts and investments, calling it "unprecedented" and potentially compromising U.S. foreign policy. The article highlights incidents such as Qatar offering a $400 million Boeing 747-8 to the U.S. Department of Defense and a $2 billion investment from UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin. Critics argue that these gifts create conflicts of interest and send a message that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder, potentially violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the short-lived implementation of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, dubbed "liberation day," which involved a blanket 10% tariff on all imports and higher rates on specific countries. The measures triggered global market instability and drew criticism from business leaders. After just 40 days, Trump reversed course, pausing the tariffs and making exemptions for certain goods, particularly those from China. The episode highlighted the administration's inconsistent trade strategy and raised concerns about the economic impact of tariffs on consumers and businesses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is attempting to expand its influence beyond executive branch agencies, reaching out to independent organizations and even non-governmental entities. DOGE staffers, some with limited government experience, are requesting to embed teams within these organizations to review their operations and finances. Some entities, like the Government Accountability Office and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, have resisted DOGE's intrusion, while others have experienced staff cuts and program terminations following DOGE's involvement, raising concerns about the initiative's scope and impact.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's proposed "one big, beautiful bill" and Ronald Reagan's ambitious budget reconciliation in 1981, known as Reaganomics. Both initiatives aimed to reshape federal fiscal policy through tax cuts and increased military spending, utilizing the budget reconciliation process to bypass filibusters in the Senate. Reagan's program promised economic stimulus through tax cuts, while Trump's includes similar tax and spending cuts, alongside policy directives. The article also highlights the role of unelected officials, such as Elon Musk in Trump's administration and David Stockman in Reagan's, in driving these significant policy changes.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is focusing on voter fraud, bringing charges against individuals for allegedly voting illegally. These cases involve non-citizens who claim they were unaware of the voting restrictions. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is assisting with these investigations by comparing Social Security data with state voter data to identify potential non-citizens on voter rolls. Critics worry that these isolated cases will be used to justify restrictive voting laws, while election administrators emphasize the need for precise measures rather than broad restrictions to address the issue.</p>

The court heard that they had conducted a "dry run" prior to the actual attempt, meeting a larger ship at sea to collect the drugs. The judge acknowledged their guilty pleas but emphasized the significant role they played in the operation, contributing to the availability of cocaine for addicts in the UK.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with the police investigating the theft. Locals suspect the statue was either vandalized or melted down for cash, but do not believe the disappearance was politically motivated. The statue, which replaced a wooden version that was previously set on fire, had been criticized for its unesthetic appearance and failure to capture the likeness of the former first lady. The statue's disappearance has not been met with widespread mourning in Sevnica, which has otherwise capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump.</p>

          <p>Nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine, according to local officials. The attack occurred in Bilopillia, Sumy, as the bus traveled to the regional capital, and injured seven others. The incident took place shortly after Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since 2022, where they agreed to a prisoner of war swap. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a deliberate killing of civilians, while Russian state media claimed forces hit a "military staging area" in Sumy.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen who accidentally drifted into South Korean waters have been stranded for over three months, longer than any previous reluctant defectors, due to Pyongyang's refusal to communicate with Seoul. The men have repeatedly expressed their desire to return home, but North Korea has severed all communication channels with the South. Experts suggest this is a sign of Pyongyang's displeasure with Seoul's hard-line policies, leaving the fishermen stuck until relations improve or they change their minds about returning.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, finding that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The findings also indicate that early settlers split into groups isolated in different environmental settings, providing a new genetic and cultural understanding of present-day South American communities.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a "flexible approach" in courting Taiwan's remaining allies, as evidenced by the attendance of delegations from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, these countries participated in the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum, underscoring Beijing's efforts to exert diplomatic pressure on Taipei.
