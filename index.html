          <p>President Trump has announced a planned partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and boost the U.S. economy by $14 billion. The White House suggests Trump has approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, despite previous national security concerns. Both companies have expressed their support for the decision, with Nippon Steel applauding Trump's action and U.S. Steel appreciating his leadership. The Committee on Foreign Investment initially reviewed the deal under President Biden, who had previously blocked it, but Trump reexamined the proposal after winning the election.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, particularly amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarization. Businesses in Qatar are interested in leveraging Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for investments and trades with China. The increase in yuan-denominated transactions could benefit Hong Kong's financial sector, especially as ties between China and oil-rich Qatar strengthen. This trend reflects a broader effort to de-dollarize in response to US trade policies, aligning with China's long-term strategy to mitigate risks and achieve financial independence.</p>

          <p>Seven Emmy-nominated actors, including Billy Bob Thornton and Allison Janney, participated in a roundtable discussion about their careers, experiences with fame, and challenges in the acting industry. The actors shared personal anecdotes, including early career mishaps, moments of self-doubt, and insights into their creative processes. Janney revealed that she almost became a systems analyst due to being deemed 'uncastable' early in her career because of her height. The conversation touched on the actors' approaches to portraying complex characters and the impact of real-world anxieties on their roles, offering a glimpse into the lives and perspectives of performers navigating the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments and provide appropriate care for individuals experiencing mental distress. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to offer timely support and prevent hospital admissions. NHS England anticipates the new units will reduce pressure on emergency services, but Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health has expressed skepticism, emphasizing the need for proper funding and careful testing of the model before national rollout. A recent study revealed a high number of patients waiting extended hours in A&E, highlighting the urgency for improved mental health services.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by Project N.O.L.A., a private organization, in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has sparked controversy and debate. While authorities claim the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, critics, including the ACLU, raise concerns about privacy violations and the potential for misuse. The New Orleans Police Department had paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until the technology's use aligns with legal requirements. Project N.O.L.A. operates around 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates, which has led to concerns about mass surveillance and potential biases in the technology.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The loss of contact, lasting about 20 seconds, occurred as the helicopter approached the Pentagon. An antenna used for communication was temporarily positioned in a location that did not maintain consistent contact with the helicopter. The FAA is investigating, and the Army has paused flights into and out of the Pentagon to address safety concerns after a previous deadly midair collision in January.</p>

The decision reflects consumer interest in more affordable options, as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached record levels.

Concerns are rising that some vapers may return to smoking cigarettes or purchase disposable vapes from other countries. Retailers are worried about financial losses due to unsold stock, and some believe the ban will not significantly change vaping habits.</p>

          <h2>Paul Weiss Partners Depart After Trump Deal</h2>

          <p>Four partners at Paul Weiss, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving the firm after it made a controversial deal with President Trump to avoid federal targeting. The agreement involved Paul Weiss auditing its hiring practices and dedicating $40 million to pro bono legal services on causes agreed upon by both the firm and the Trump administration. The departures follow criticism of the firm for employing Mark Pomerantz, who worked on the Manhattan prosecutors' team investigating Trump, and for taking on a pro bono case related to the January 6 Capitol riot. Other law firms have chosen to sue the administration over similar orders, with some judges ruling them unconstitutional.</p>

The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost 320 billion yuan (US$44.4 billion), is part of a larger project to connect Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water. The canal aims to reduce logistical costs and integrate inland regions with coastal hubs. The canal is planned as a Class III waterway, capable of accommodating 1,000-tonne vessels and handling around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

The new restrictions limit reporters to a specific area of the building and require escorts for movement elsewhere.

The EU remains committed to securing a deal that benefits both sides, but is prepared to defend its interests. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both the U.S. and EU economies. Negotiations are ongoing, but Trump has expressed impatience with the pace of progress.</p>

The deal includes the company admitting to obstructing federal aviation officials and paying $1.1 billion in fines. The government said it had conferred with families of crash victims, and said many either supported or did not oppose the deal.</p>
