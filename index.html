          <p>Researchers have presented new evidence suggesting rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Quebec, Canada, are 4.16 billion years old, potentially making them the oldest on Earth. This finding, published in the journal Science, utilized multiple dating techniques that yielded consistent results, aiming to settle a long-standing scientific dispute over the rocks' age. The discovery could provide crucial insights into Earth's early formation and the origins of life, though the local Inuit community has restricted access to the site to prevent damage and exploitation.</p>

          <p>Following a classified briefing, several Senate Democrats have raised doubts about the Trump administration's claim that recent U.S. airstrikes resulted in the "total obliteration" of Iran's nuclear program. Senators like Chris Murphy and Mark Warner stated they believe significant nuclear capability remains, suggesting the program was set back by months, not years or decades as the president claimed. While some Republicans defended the administration's assessment, the briefing highlighted a partisan divide over the strategic effectiveness and long-term impact of the military action against Tehran.</p>

          <p>The recent murder of a 17-year-old TikTok star in Pakistan has intensified concerns over the safety of women with public online profiles. Many female social media users in the country report that online stalking, threats, and harassment often escalate into real-world violence and privacy violations. Activists and users point to deep-seated patriarchal norms that perceive women's self-expression and visibility as a threat to cultural values, leading to a social environment where such attacks are sometimes seen as justified. While some platform features have helped, many feel that social media companies and authorities are not doing enough to protect them.</p>

This trend comes as the president has largely bypassed the traditional Justice Department review process, instead granting pardons to political allies, supporters, and Jan. 6 rioters.

          <p>A fierce debate is underway regarding whether to remove the grizzly bear from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections. After being listed in 1975 when their population dwindled, grizzly numbers in the Yellowstone area have recovered beyond initial goals, leading to increased human-wildlife conflicts as they expand their territory. Proponents of delisting, including state wildlife officials, argue the species has met all scientific recovery benchmarks and that continued protection undermines the ESA's purpose. However, conservation groups and some biologists warn that delisting would expose grizzlies to new threats like hunting and political interference, potentially reversing decades of progress.</p>

          <p>Two Milwaukee police officers were shot and critically injured in what is being described as an ambush late Thursday night. The officers were reportedly fired upon as they approached an alley while responding to a call about a person with a weapon. A 32-year-old officer is in critical condition, while a 29-year-old officer sustained a non-life-threatening injury. Authorities are conducting a search for at least one suspect and have urged the individual to surrender, as city officials condemned the out-of-control violence.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police in the UK have arrested four individuals following a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, a major military airbase. The arrests come after the group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for spraying paint on military aircraft, including an Airbus Voyager transport plane. Three of the suspects were arrested on terror-related charges, while a fourth was arrested for assisting an offender. The incident has prompted the UK government to move towards proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist organization and has triggered a security review of all UK military bases.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin offered a stark critique of her party, describing it as a "solar system with no sun" due to its internal divisions and lack of teamwork. In a speech outlining a new vision for Democrats, she argued the party must focus on fundamental "pocketbook" issues like jobs, housing, and healthcare to address what she calls the greatest national security threat: a shrinking middle class. Slotkin identified a key split between Democrats who see the Trump administration as an existential threat and those who view it as survivable, urging the party to adopt a more unified, fighting mentality.</p>

In contrast, less wealthy affluent buyers are more sensitive to high interest rates and are acting with more caution. According to a Coldwell Banker survey of luxury agents, over half have seen an increase in cash purchases in 2025, driven by a desire to avoid high borrowing costs. While real estate remains an attractive hard asset, the market saw a dip in May, and buyers at all levels have become more discerning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New college graduates are entering a particularly difficult job market, a situation confirmed by economic data and not just youthful pessimism. The unemployment rate for recent graduates has risen to 5.8%, and employers have scaled back hiring projections, partly due to economic uncertainty from new tariffs and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on entry-level roles. While the overall job market is relatively stable, the gap between the general unemployment rate and that of new graduates is at a record high. Despite these challenges, sectors like healthcare, engineering, and state government still offer strong opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
