This announcement follows a period of significant change at the cultural institution, where the Trump administration recently replaced board members and leadership. The president also outlined plans for extensive renovations to the center, aiming to restore its "luxury, glamour, and entertainment."</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is standing by its economic analysis which concluded that consumers will ultimately bear the majority of the costs from recent tariffs. The report prompted public criticism from President Trump, who suggested the bank should replace its economist. An economist from the firm reiterated that their models show consumers absorbing about two-thirds of the tariff costs, potentially pushing a key inflation metric to 3.2% by year's end. Despite the forecast, the firm believes the Federal Reserve is more likely to focus on the labor market when considering interest rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>FAA Grapples with Critical Air Traffic Controller Shortage Amid High Training Failure Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is facing a critical shortage of approximately 3,000 air traffic controllers, a situation contributing to summer travel delays. A key issue is the high failure rate at the Federal Aviation Administration's sole training facility, where about 35% of trainees do not complete the intensive program. To address this, the FAA is implementing new strategies, including a mentoring program and the use of advanced immersive tower simulators to accelerate certification. Despite these efforts, over 90% of U.S. air traffic control towers remain understaffed, and new controllers still require years of on-the-job training.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, reversing a lower court's injunction. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court determined that the nonprofit groups challenging the cuts lacked the legal standing to sue under the Impoundment Control Act. This ruling sidestepped the core constitutional question of whether the executive branch can unilaterally withhold funds appropriated by Congress. A dissenting judge argued that the decision facilitates an unlawful expansion of executive power and harms the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a significant portion of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension violated an earlier preliminary injunction that protected the university system's grants. The administration's move to freeze the funds is tied to its threats against universities over pro-Palestinian student protests, which it claims have fostered antisemitism.

          <p>A Guardian opinion article contends that the federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police department is a move drawn from an authoritarian playbook, designed to create a sense of crisis to justify an expansion of power. The author argues that President Trump's claims of rampant crime are contradicted by official data showing that violent crime is at historic lows in D.C. and other cities he has targeted. The piece suggests this action is not about public safety but is a deliberate strategy to consolidate control, test the limits of federal authority, and potentially apply similar tactics to other American cities.</p>

During the trial, his defense team admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse by his mother caused him to develop dissociative amnesia.

          <p>Social Security recipients could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment beneficiaries received this year. The Social Security Administration will make its official announcement in October, basing the final figure on inflation rates from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively steady, some economists worry that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin is "bluffing" about seeking peace and that his true objective remains the occupation of Ukraine. Zelenskyy's comments came after a virtual meeting with President Trump and European leaders, where French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed Trump plans to push for a ceasefire at the upcoming summit with Putin in Alaska. Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry stated its position on ending the war has not changed, insisting on Ukraine's withdrawal from certain regions and abandoning NATO aspirations.</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-Russia summit approaches, analysis is focusing on the potential territorial outcomes of any ceasefire agreement in Ukraine. Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, and speculation has emerged about proposals to freeze the current lines of contact or even conduct territorial swaps. Such a deal could involve Ukraine ceding control of the remaining parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, a concession Kyiv would find extremely difficult after immense sacrifice. The article notes that recent talk of land swaps has caused significant alarm in both Ukraine and European capitals.</p>
