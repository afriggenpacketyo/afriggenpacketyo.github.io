          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a prostate nodule. While the cancer is aggressive, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, and Biden is reviewing treatment options with his physicians. Biden's health has been under scrutiny since before he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race, giving way to then-Vice President Kamala Harris to top the Democratic presidential ticket.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a major drone bombardment on Ukraine, primarily targeting Kyiv, just before President Trump was expected to speak with President Putin about a potential cease-fire. The attacks resulted in casualties and injuries, highlighting the escalating aerial assaults. Meanwhile, President Zelensky met with Vice President Vance in Rome to discuss cease-fire negotiations, attempting to diffuse previous tensions. Former American ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A. Brink, criticized the Trump administration's approach, stating that she resigned because she could not support policies that pressured Ukraine instead of Russia. The article underscores the ongoing diplomatic efforts and increasing military actions in the region.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in the northern and southern Gaza Strip to pressure Hamas for the release of hostages, while also permitting a basic quantity of food into Gaza after a prolonged blockade. Prime Minister Netanyahu's office attributed the policy reversal to an operational need to expand the military operation, though details about the offensive remain scarce. The renewed offensive comes as Israel and Hamas engage in indirect cease-fire talks in Doha, Qatar, with Netanyahu signaling a willingness to discuss terms for a broader deal. However, he reiterated conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and demilitarization of Gaza.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick revealed that he once spent $5,000 on special milk to appease Antonio Brown and maintain his relationship with Tom Brady during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots. Brown had ordered the milk for Brady, who is very nutrition-oriented, but it spoiled before it could be used. Belichick approved the expense to avoid ruining the relationship between Brown and Brady, who later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The incident prompted a response from the New York Police Department and other city agencies, leading to a brief closure of the bridge.
