          <p>President Trump will hold a rally in Macomb County, Michigan, to celebrate his first 100 days in office, a key battleground state he flipped from Democrats. This marks his first major trip outside personal weekend getaways, with a focus on the automotive hub near Detroit. The rally occurs amidst meetings with Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, potentially finding common ground on issues like the future of Selfridge Air National Guard Base, where Trump aims to maintain operations and strength. The visit highlights Michigan's importance in Trump's political strategy and potential areas of bipartisan cooperation within the state.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News feature explores the treatment of visa overstayers in Japan, where they face arrest, detention, and deportation under the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act. While the Justice Ministry deported nearly 19,000 foreigners in 2024 for immigration violations, mostly overstays, concerns are rising about equating undocumented status with criminality. A Buddhist nun who shelters Vietnamese residents advocates for understanding unavoidable circumstances and offering a second chance. The article highlights a growing international trend toward using neutral terms like "undocumented" instead of "illegal" to protect immigrants' human rights, a shift Japan has yet to fully embrace.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to reform college accreditation by emphasizing "results" over "woke ideology" and questioning the math skills of students at elite universities. The order directs the Department of Education to hold accreditors accountable and potentially recognize new ones. Another executive order enforces laws requiring universities to disclose large foreign gifts, with Harvard specifically called out for alleged violations.

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China has unveiled a complex prehistoric food chain, where a dinosaur species, Huadanosaurus sinensis, consumed a mammal. Notably, the mammal itself, a gobiconodontid, was known to prey on small dinosaurs. This creates an ecological loop, illustrating a predator-prey dynamic between dinosaurs and mammals from 125 million years ago. The eutherian in its gut was swallowed whole, indicating Huadanosaurus likely killed its prey with a powerful bite.</p>
