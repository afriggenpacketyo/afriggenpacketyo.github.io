          <p>A 60-year-old man was arrested in Sydney after allegedly firing up to 100 bullets at random cars and police on a busy street, injuring 20 people. One man suffered a serious gunshot wound, while 19 others were treated for shrapnel or shattered glass injuries. Police seized two rifles from the scene, and the gunman's motive remains unclear, with no links to terrorism or gang activity identified. Mass shootings are rare in Australia, which has strict gun laws since 1996.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon, deeming his claims of a "war zone" "untethered to the facts." This decision followed an earlier block on Oregon's own Guard deployment. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also condemned Trump's order to send Texas National Guard members to Illinois, calling it an "invasion" and an abuse of power. These deployments, also affecting Chicago, have sparked legal challenges and strong opposition from Democratic state leaders, raising constitutional questions about federal military intervention in states without consent.</p>

          <p>The concept of a "swag gap" in relationships, where one partner is perceived as less fashionable or makes less effort in appearance, is gaining traction on social media. While some argue that mismatched aesthetics can lead to conflicts and feelings of disrespect, others contend that style is subjective and should not dictate a relationship's success. Relationship experts suggest that trying to change a partner's style can be dangerous, advocating instead for acceptance and mutual support. Ultimately, the focus should be on shared values and energy rather than outward appearance.</p>

          <p>Russell Martin's brief and "excruciating" tenure as Rangers manager concluded after just 17 games, making him the fourth boss dismissed in less than three years. Fans and critics widely criticized his performance, marked by poor results, including significant European losses and a lack of improvement. Martin's tendency to blame others for the team's failings further alienated supporters. Despite substantial summer investment in the squad, the club's dysfunctional atmosphere and the manager's inability to deliver immediate success led to his chaotic departure.</p>

          <p>Jim Gavin, the Fianna Fáil candidate and former Dublin gaelic football manager, has withdrawn from the Irish presidential election with immediate effect. His decision followed a news report alleging he owed €3,300 to a former tenant, which he stated was "not in keeping with my character." Taoiseach Micheál Martin supported Gavin's withdrawal, emphasizing the need for the presidential office to remain untainted by controversy. Gavin had previously faced "smears" online and vowed to combat misinformation.</p>

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a mass sexual assault victim, returns to court to face one of her sexual assailants appealing last year's conviction where 51 men were found guilty of sexually assaulting her while she was drugged by her husband. Her defiant public stance was initially seen as a catalyst against sexual violence, but campaigners now observe a "wilting" optimism in France. Despite a surge in reported sexual assault cases, conviction rates remain flat, and sexual assault culture ideas are noted. The case underscores ongoing challenges in combating sexual violence and impunity in France.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, and crucially, in producing high-end chips to power these technologies, directly challenging US dominance. Tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, with Huawei announcing a three-year plan to rival Nvidia. While some experts caution about data transparency, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledges China's rapid progress, warning the US to compete for survival. Beijing's state-led approach aims for self-reliance amidst US tariffs and export restrictions, pushing for domestic chip adoption despite remaining reliant on the US for the most powerful chips currently.</p>

          <p>The US Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), or "vaccine court," offers a no-fault system to compensate Americans for rare vaccine-related injuries, having paid out billions since the 1980s. This system balances public health benefits of vaccination with individual harm, partially shielding manufacturers from lawsuits. However, COVID-19 vaccines are currently excluded, falling under a more restrictive emergency program, leading to calls for their inclusion. The court faces a backlog of over 3,000 cases, highlighting a need for more resources amidst increasing politicization of vaccination issues.</p>

          <p>India is actively working to attract skilled Indian professionals back from the US, prompted by President Trump's abrupt hike in H-1B visa fees to $100,000. This move is seen as an opportunity to reverse the brain drain and boost nation-building, with anecdotal evidence suggesting a rise in inquiries from those looking to relocate. While growth in Global Capability Centres offers new work opportunities, experts argue that a concerted government effort, beyond current initiatives, is needed to create compelling incentives for large-scale reverse migration.

          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms aimed at cutting costs, reducing delays, and halving failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes could save first-time buyers an average of £710 and shorten transaction times by up to four weeks. Proposals include legally requiring sellers to provide upfront property information and introducing binding contracts to prevent late withdrawals. The reforms also seek to boost professional standards in the housing sector, with a full roadmap expected next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work has emerged as a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger teams, creating 2v1 overloads for the right-back. While coach Arne Slot may be allowing Salah to conserve energy for attacking, the team's defensive setup behind him isn't compensating effectively, leading to conceded chances. This tactical imbalance is more pronounced when Liverpool doesn't dominate possession. Despite a recent dip in form and team control, there's optimism that Salah's scoring will improve and the team will find its balance as new players integrate.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that US forces struck another vessel illegally carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela, signaling an expansion of anti-drug trafficking efforts to include land operations. Speaking at a US Navy anniversary event, Trump lauded the navy's role in "blow[ing] the cartel terrorists the hell out of the water." These strikes, which the US defends as countering "narco-terrorists," have been condemned by the United Nations as extrajudicial executions. The announcement comes amidst a federal government shutdown, which Trump criticized Democrats for enabling.</p>
