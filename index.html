The bank reported revenue of $45.68 billion, surpassing estimates, although net income fell compared to the previous year due to a one-time gain from Visa shares in that period. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conflicts, and fiscal deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government established a confidential relocation program for Afghans after a significant data breach in February 2022 exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 applicants. An official from the Ministry of Defence inadvertently released the sensitive information, which was discovered when parts of it were posted on Facebook. The existence of the 'Afghan Response Route,' created in April 2024, was initially kept secret by a court injunction but has now been made public following a High Court decision.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of citizens in Angola's capital, Luanda, participated in mass protests against a government decree that increased fuel prices, leading to a harsh crackdown by police with multiple injuries and arrests. The demonstrations reflect broader public discontent with the ruling MPLA party over the rising cost of living, with taxi and bus fares also increasing. The protests were organized by a social movement and included activists, students, and opposition members, who vow to continue their demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has obtained approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to Chinese companies, reversing a previous ban. CEO Jensen Huang announced the policy change, stating that the U.S. government will grant the necessary licenses for the shipments to resume. This decision is seen as a significant benefit for Nvidia, allowing it to compete more effectively with rivals like Huawei in the large Chinese market and helping to ease trade frictions in the global semiconductor supply chain.</p>

Mexico, which supplies about 70% of tomatoes consumed in the U.S., rejected the dumping accusations.

          <p>A four-person international crew, led by veteran retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, has safely returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The team splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, concluding a 20-day commercial mission to the International Space Station. This flight was the fourth privately funded mission to the station organized by Axiom Space, a company that arranges research trips for non-NASA astronauts. Axiom is using these missions to gain experience for its future goal of building a commercial space station.</p>

          <p>An exploration team has discovered the wreck of the Teruzuki, a Japanese destroyer sunk during a pivotal World War II battle off the Solomon Islands in 1942. The Ocean Exploration Trust located the warship over 2,600 feet below the surface, revealing it is still armed with unused depth charges. The discovery of the ship, which was split in two, provides new insights into its sinking and naval history, as no historical photos of the Teruzuki exist. The find is significant for understanding the fierce naval campaign for Guadalcanal.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Convention on Wetlands warns that the ongoing destruction of global wetlands could result in economic losses of up to $39 trillion by 2050. Since 1970, 22% of the world's wetlands, which are crucial for flood control, water purification, and supporting fisheries, have disappeared. The report identifies land-use change, pollution, and climate change as primary drivers of this decline. It calls for annual investments between $275 billion and $550 billion to protect and restore these vital ecosystems.</p>

Under the proposals, banks would send information about investment options to savers, supported by a government advertising campaign.

The plan aims to boost individual returns and stimulate UK economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The launch coincided with the opening of Tesla's first showroom in Mumbai. The steep price is largely due to India's high tariffs on imported EVs, positioning the Model Y in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market competitors. Analysts suggest this is a 'soft launch' for Tesla to test the market before committing to local manufacturing.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, according to official data, keeping it on track to meet the government's annual growth target of around 5%. The growth was supported by government stimulus and a temporary pause in trade war escalations with the U.S., which allowed for a surge in exports. However, analysts warn this pace may not be sustainable due to underlying issues such as weak consumer confidence, falling prices, and a persistent crisis in the property sector.
