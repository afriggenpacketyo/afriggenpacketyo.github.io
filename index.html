          <p>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory for the state's southern peninsula. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but stated that widespread, large waves are not expected due to the quake's shallow depth. The event was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, a seismically active region known as the "Ring of Fire," but did not pose a threat to Anchorage. Multiple aftershocks were reported following the main quake.</p>

          <p>A research note from Wolfe Research outlines potential negative consequences if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, describing the scenario as a "mess." The analysis suggests such a move would likely trigger a significant equity selloff and could lead to a legal battle ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. The note explores various scenarios, including Powell suing to stop his removal and the unsettling possibility of him being escorted from the Fed building, highlighting the unprecedented challenge to the central bank's independence.

These explosives are a remnant of Angola's 27-year civil war, and despite significant clearing efforts, an estimated 1,000 minefields still pose a threat to local communities.</p>

          <p>Ford has issued a recall for 694,271 Bronco Sport and Escape SUVs from model years 2020-2024 due to a potential fire hazard. The issue stems from a faulty fuel injector that can crack and leak fuel into the engine compartment, increasing the risk of ignition. As an interim solution, Ford dealers will provide a free engine control software update to detect leaks and reduce engine power to prevent fires. A permanent fix is still being developed, and owners will be notified when it becomes available.</p>

The article questions when the financial burden of these tariffs, which have remained at or above 10% on most imported goods, will become apparent to the public. Despite predictions from many economists that consumers would bear the cost, the exact timing and visibility of this impact remain a key question.

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's reversal on the Jeffrey Epstein files could alienate his core supporters. For years, Trump and his allies fueled conspiracy theories about a government cover-up, priming his base to expect a major revelation. Now, his administration's dismissal of the story as a "hoax" and his lashing out at "PAST supporters" creates a direct conflict with the anti-establishment narrative that is central to his political appeal. This situation is unique because it forces Trump to defend the government's official position against a conspiracy he helped popularize.</p>

          <p>President Trump has forcefully dismissed the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation as a "hoax" and a "scam" created by Democrats. In a significant rhetorical shift, he also criticized his own supporters for believing in the controversy, calling them "weaklings" and stating he no longer wants their support on this issue. This comes as his administration faces pressure to release more information from the probe. When pressed, Trump insisted the story was a hoax without providing evidence, further deepening the divide with some Republicans who are demanding more transparency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, calling it "highly unlikely" just hours after reports surfaced that he had discussed the idea with Republican lawmakers. Despite this, Trump continued his criticism, calling Powell a "knucklehead" for not lowering interest rates. The president's mixed signals have created uncertainty, as dismissing a Fed chair would be a significant break from precedent and could undermine the central bank's independence. Analysts note the administration may be building a case for removal "for cause," a legal standard typically implying serious misconduct. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump offered a positive assessment of China's efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, stating that Beijing is "making big steps" on the issue. This contrasts with his previous rhetoric, where he has explicitly used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs. This shift in tone comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests President Trump's strategy of dismissing the Jeffrey Epstein files controversy could backfire by pitting him against his most loyal supporters. By labeling the issue a "hoax" and blaming his own base for falling for it, Trump risks undermining his carefully crafted image as an anti-establishment truth-teller. This approach puts him in the position of defending the official government line against a narrative he and his allies helped create. While most Republican officeholders remain supportive, the grumbling among his base could create a significant political challenge for the president.</p>
