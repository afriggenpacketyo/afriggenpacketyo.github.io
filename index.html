          <p>Two men, Rashid Gedel and Samuel Dodsworth, have been formally charged with the murder of former Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins at Wakefield Prison. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence for a series of severe child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, when he was fatally injured in an incident. The accused are scheduled to appear before Leeds Magistrates' Court. Watkins had previously been attacked in the same prison in 2023, though his injuries on that occasion were not life-threatening.</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas begins, the first group of hostages held for two years in Gaza has been released and returned to Israel. This development coincides with the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to address the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, to discuss the ongoing peace process. The initial release involved seven of the final 20 hostages, marking a significant step in the agreement as Palestinians in Gaza begin to return to their homes and assess the conflict's devastation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa is currently embroiled in a significant legal and social debate over the potential decriminalization of sex work, a practice currently illegal in the country. Proponents, including advocacy groups like SWEAT, argue that decriminalization would protect the estimated 150,000 sex workers from violence, police harassment, and health risks, framing it as a labor rights issue. Opponents, such as the Cause for Justice NGO, contend that it degrades women and promotes trafficking. The outcome of a major court case and a stalled decriminalization bill will determine the future of sex work legislation in the nation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has called for the immediate release of 30 leaders from Zion Church, one of China's largest underground Christian networks, who were detained in coordinated raids across multiple cities. The arrests, which included the church's founder Jin Mingri, are seen by Christian groups as the most significant crackdown on the faith in decades. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the detentions as an affront to religious freedom, while Beijing maintained it governs religious affairs by law and opposes U.S. interference.</p>
