          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak in 2025, with cases exceeding those of recent years, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, particularly in West Texas, where two deaths have occurred. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports over 880 cases across 29 states, emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine in preventing the highly contagious disease. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, urging people to get vaccinated to achieve community immunity. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly supported the measles vaccine as the deadly outbreak spread in the Southwest.</p>

          <p>Amazon initially considered displaying import charges on its low-cost Haul products in response to potential tariff changes but later stated that the plan was not approved and would not be implemented. This decision followed White House criticism, which labeled the reported plan a "hostile and political act." Amazon clarified that the consideration was unrelated to Trump's proposed 145% tariff on imports from China, while discount e-tailers Temu and Shein have already implemented price hikes and added import charges. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy previously stated that sellers would likely need to pass the cost of tariffs on to consumers.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that the Trump administration plans to soften the impact of automotive tariffs, amidst concerns about regulatory uncertainty and additional costs for the car industry. Current tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will remain, but the new measures will prevent adjacent levies, such as additional tariffs on steel and aluminum, from "stacking" on top of the others. While additional tariffs on auto parts are still expected to take effect, there will be some reimbursements available, potentially easing the financial strain on U.S. automakers.</p>

          <p>Renée Richards, a transgender sports pioneer, expressed concerns about increasing restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days, particularly the ban on transgender Americans serving openly in the military. Richards, who famously fought for the right to play in the U.S. Open after transitioning, believes the debate over transgender athletes has expanded to broader restrictions in various sectors. While she supports restricting transgender women who transition after puberty from competing in women's sports, she criticizes the broader trend of anti-transgender policies. She suggests that President Trump's stance is influenced by a small group opposing transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Senator Angus King of Maine delivered a 'Declaration of Conscience' criticizing President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, echoing Senator Margaret Chase Smith's historic speech. King argues that Trump is engaged in a direct assault on the Constitution, citing actions such as dismantling essential agencies, attempting to cut off funds to states based on policy disagreements, and compromising national security. He fears a path toward one-man rule and calls on Congress, the courts, and the American people to uphold constitutional responsibilities. King warns that the current disregard for constitutional means could have future consequences for all Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by significant disruption due to tariffs and executive orders, leading to economic uncertainty and a potential recession. Despite promises of prosperity, his policies have caused market instability, a weakened dollar, and strained international relations, particularly with China. Economists estimate a considerable likelihood of a U.S. recession in 2025, with concerns growing about the global economy. While Trump's actions appeal to his base, his high disapproval rating reflects broader unease about his economic approach and its impact on the U.S.'s global standing.</p>

Susan Burns, the U.S. Consul General, attended a reception in Ho Chi Minh City, though the U.S. ambassador was not present. Critics welcomed Burns' presence but noted that the administration still lacks understanding about postwar reconciliation with Vietnam, a strategic partner against China.

          <p>The Vietnam War, which ended 50 years ago, significantly altered perceptions of war, particularly regarding its long-term psychological and social consequences. The recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) emerged from the experiences of Vietnam veterans, highlighting the invisible wounds carried by soldiers. While PTSD is now recognized and treated, the Vietnamese government's official narrative limited discussion of psychological trauma among its soldiers. Overcoming trauma requires societal engagement through remembrance rituals, popular narratives, reconciliation efforts, and acknowledgment of atrocities and suffering.</p>

Amnesty International and the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) are urging that the officers identified in the documentary "face the law." The Kenyan government has responded by saying "every life is important", the police watchdog is conducting an investigation and criticised the BBC documentary for being "one-sided".</p>
