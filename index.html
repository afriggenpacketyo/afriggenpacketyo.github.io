          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has reignited discussions about his mental and physical fitness. The recording, documenting a portion of the interview regarding classified information, captures Biden's halting speech and memory lapses, reinforcing Hur's description of him as an "elderly man with a poor memory." The release coincides with a forthcoming book detailing concerns about Biden's cognitive decline and advisors' efforts to suppress related discussions, prompting Democrats to reassess their previous defenses of his fitness.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure and declaring it an essential health benefit. Aides are preparing a report on combating infertility, consulting with industry leaders and conservative policy groups. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has not been invited to participate, raising concerns. The White House aims to balance expanding access with the views of Christian conservatives who oppose IVF due to concerns about embryo loss. </p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now playing for the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, faced a hostile reception from Yankee fans in his return to Yankee Stadium.

The game, part of a Subway Series between the first-place Mets and Yankees, saw the Yankees triumph 6-2, underscoring the rivalry and Soto's new position as a Met. </p>

          <p>The potential cancellation of a series of music festivals in Brockwell Park, London, has been described as a 'devastating blow' by the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA).

The NTIA warns that cancelling the festivals would impact thousands of people and the local economy, while the Protect Brockwell Park campaign emphasizes they are not anti-events but seek constructive engagement with the council. </p>
