          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with the investigation. While the suspect remains silent, authorities are gathering information from his acquaintances and family members, who have allegedly pointed to his "deeply indoctrinated leftist ideology" as a potential factor. Cox also confirmed reports that the suspect communicated on Discord after the shooting and that his roommate, who is cooperating, is a transgender woman. A motive has not yet been officially established, and charges are expected to be filed soon.</p>

          <p>An explosion completely destroyed an empty house in Bradford, UK, injuring five people in neighboring properties, including a man, woman, and child who suffered minor injuries. Police have arrested two men in connection with the incident, which is being investigated as a case of metal theft. A 27-year-old man was found seriously injured near the scene and arrested on suspicion of theft, while a 28-year-old was arrested for metal theft after initially fleeing. The blast was powerful enough to shake nearby homes and scatter debris across the street.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham described the current U.S. political climate as a "dangerous place." He argues that political violence historically erupts when fundamental questions about national identity and inclusion are in dispute, creating an existential crisis for the nation. Meacham emphasizes that resorting to violence over political disagreements breaks the American covenant of peaceful contention and debate. He urges political leaders to learn from history and make a compelling case for a more perfect, respectful, and non-violent union to preserve democracy.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has claimed responsibility for a successful drone strike on the Kirishi oil refinery, one of Russia's largest, located in the Leningrad region. The attack caused a significant fire, though Russian officials reported it was extinguished with no injuries. This strike is part of Ukraine's ongoing campaign to disrupt Russia's oil infrastructure, which Kyiv says is crucial to Moscow's war effort. The attacks have contributed to domestic gasoline shortages in Russia, prompting the government to temporarily ban gasoline exports to stabilize the market. This incident highlights the continued strategic use of drones by both sides in the conflict.</p>

          <h2>The U.S. Constitution: A Historical Perspective on Its Enduring Relevance and Modern Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen discuss the U.S. Constitution as a living document, originally designed by its framers to be continually amended and adapted by the people. The article notes that while the Constitution has been changed through amendments like the Bill of Rights and those abolishing slavery, it has not seen a meaningful update in over 50 years. Rosen expresses concern that modern political gridlock, where Congress abdicates its role and courts hold excessive power, is contrary to the founders' intent. Despite current strains, he argues the document's core principles of limited government and rule of law remain timeless and essential for preventing tyranny.</p>

          <p>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has reported that Desmond Holly, the 16-year-old who injured two students before taking his own life at a Colorado high school, was an active user of a website known for graphic violence and extremist content. The report links this site to several other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of radicalization within these online spaces that glorify violence. Holly's social media activity also showed admiration for past mass shooters and engagement with extremist symbols and rhetoric. The ADL highlights the role of such online platforms as a common thread in a growing trend of youth violence.</p>

          <p>A "Social Security tax trap" can catch affluent retirees by surprise, significantly increasing their tax burden due to required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred retirement accounts like traditional IRAs. These mandatory withdrawals, which begin at age 73, increase a retiree's combined income, potentially pushing them over the threshold where Social Security benefits become taxable. This can cause a sudden jump from paying no tax on benefits to paying tax on up to 85% of them, and may also trigger higher Medicare premiums. One strategy to mitigate this is to gradually convert traditional IRA funds into a Roth IRA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a tragedy that should be unequivocally condemned, it is dishonest to retroactively sanitize his public life and political career. The author criticizes commentators for portraying Kirk as a practitioner of good-faith debate, when his public appearances often involved belittling opponents and spreading hateful rhetoric. The piece asserts that one can mourn his violent death without ignoring Kirk's history of opposing civil rights and promoting racist theories. The author suggests that true commitment to democratic values requires both rejecting political violence and honestly confronting divisive politics.</p>

It critiques the lack of a future vision, with political discourse being replaced by a mythical narrative of victimization and retribution. The author suggests that international recognition of a Palestinian state, while symbolic, is a necessary step to challenge this insular perspective and re-establish the rights of Palestinians.</p>

Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is seeing high demand for its AI security and Zero Trust solutions, leading to strong growth projections.

Giuffre alleged Epstein introduced her to Prince Andrew in 2001 when she was 17, leading to three instances of sexual abuse.

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to a state law, passed in August, that permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. While it is not yet clear if the suspect legally possessed the rifle used in the attack, the incident has highlighted the state's permissive gun laws. Utah does not have "red flag" laws and allows permitless concealed carry in most public spaces.

          <p>As UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party sees its popularity decline, some political observers are looking to Zohran Mamdani's successful New York mayoral primary campaign for lessons. Mamdani, a progressive Democrat, has gained significant traction with a laser-sharp focus on economic issues like housing affordability and free public transit. Analysts suggest his success stems from championing clear, compelling policies that connect to a broader narrative of siding with working-class people against the establishment. This contrasts with Labour's shifting priorities and perceived lack of a strong, overarching story, leaving it vulnerable to right-wing populists.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable display of courage, a team of Ukrainian doctors in Kyiv successfully performed a heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during a heavy Russian missile and drone attack. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through the bombarded city to retrieve the donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then conducted the life-saving surgery at the Kyiv Heart Institute as explosions shook the building. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering well, offering a powerful story of hope and resilience amid the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>The family of Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre has stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States due to his close relationship with the disgraced financier. The condemnation follows Mandelson's recent dismissal from the post after emails revealed his supportive messages to Epstein in 2008. A government minister acknowledged that it was "highly unlikely" Mandelson would have been appointed if the full extent of his ties to Epstein were known at the time. The family's statement emphasizes the need for accountability for those associated with Epstein, regardless of their status.</p>

          <p>A scrapbook compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday, recently released by House Democrats, has renewed scrutiny of his connections to powerful men. The book contains numerous messages with sexual innuendo, including an alleged note attributed to Donald Trump stating, "We have certain things in common, Jeffrey," which Trump's team has called fake. The book also lists figures like Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz as "friends." The contents have intensified questions about whether Epstein's criminal behavior was an open secret within his elite social circle and increased calls for transparency regarding his case.</p>

          <p>In this piece, UN Special Rapporteur Mary Lawlor shares the harrowing experiences of ten Palestinian human rights defenders working in Gaza amid the ongoing war and famine. These individuals risk their lives daily, navigating active conflict zones to document atrocities and gather testimonies, all while struggling to find food and water for their own families. They describe a complete breakdown of society and a loss of faith in international law, which they feel has failed to protect them. The defenders urge the international community to act to end the violence and ensure accountability for what they consider a genocide.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is raising alarms that the U.S. may be entering a more dangerous phase of political violence. Data from the first half of 2025 shows a nearly 40% increase in terrorist plots and targeted violence compared to the same period in 2024, with a significant rise in mass casualty attacks. Experts compare the current climate to the 1960s but note that modern social media and the widespread availability of lethal weapons make this era potentially more volatile. The polarized reactions to Kirk's death highlight the risk of escalating retaliatory violence.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state appears to be faltering after facing widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. Ladapo had announced a plan to end requirements for all vaccinations, but Trump publicly defended the efficacy and importance of vaccines for diseases like measles. Following the backlash, the state's health department clarified it would only propose rule changes for immunizations not mandated by legislation for school entry. The future of the broader rollback is now uncertain, as it would require the support of state lawmakers.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the potential danger of door-to-door scams, prompted by a reader's unsettling encounter with an aggressive person offering lawn-mowing services. It advises that while not all door-to-door salespeople are fraudulent, high-pressure tactics, refusal to take no for an answer, and demands for upfront cash payment are major red flags. Common scams involve home repair, utility services, or security system upgrades, often targeting older adults. To stay safe, experts recommend not opening the door to strangers, verifying credentials independently, and always getting a written contract before agreeing to any work or payment.</p>

          <p>Following days of violent anti-corruption protests that led to the ousting of her predecessor and left at least 72 people dead, Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki, has vowed to address the demands of the youth-led movement. Karki, a former chief justice chosen by activists, acknowledged she was brought to power by "the streets" and promised to focus on ending corruption and ensuring good governance. She has also committed to holding new elections within six months and handing over power to a new government. The unrest was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations.</p>

          <p>The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, representing families of Israelis held by Hamas, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to securing the hostages' release. The group claims that every time a potential deal approaches, Netanyahu "sabotages it," pointing to the recent Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar as the latest example. They argue the Prime Minister's actions are designed to prolong the war and help him cling to power, at the expense of the hostages' lives. This statement puts the families in direct opposition to Netanyahu, who has asserted that eliminating Hamas leadership is necessary.</p>

Despite a criminal record for armed robbery, Kelvin underwent significant rehabilitation while incarcerated, earning certifications, taking parenting classes, and building a positive relationship with his children. Upon his release, he was handed over to ICE and deported to El Salvador, where he was immediately imprisoned in a notorious facility.

          <p>Missouri has become the latest Republican-led state to redraw its congressional map at President Trump's urging, passing a plan designed to flip a Democratic-held seat. This is part of a national trend initiated by Trump to create more favorable maps for Republicans to help maintain their U.S. House majority ahead of the midterm elections. In response, Democratic states like California are pursuing their own partisan redistricting to counter the Republican efforts. This race to gerrymander undermines the work of independent commissions and raises concerns about increasing political polarization and the dilution of minority voting power.</p>
