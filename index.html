          <p>A Japanese nutritionist details her visit to a Costco in Kyoto, highlighting the vast and unique selection of foods compared to U.S. stores. She points to the incredible variety of seaweed, soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal Japanese produce that are staples in the local diet but harder to find in America. The article also notes the availability of healthy, ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a wide array of green tea products, reflecting key aspects of Japanese culinary culture that she wishes were more common in U.S. locations.</p>

          <h2>Justin Bieber's New Album Reflects a Somber Cultural Mood</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Justin Bieber's surprise album, "Swag," suggesting its melancholic and subdued sound is capturing the current cultural zeitgeist better than upbeat summer anthems. The piece highlights the lead single "Daisies" and the album's overall production, which departs from Bieber's pop roots towards a more introspective, R&B-influenced style. It argues that this downtempo, gauzy sound resonates with a public mood that is more hungover and anxious than celebratory, fitting into a broader trend of reserved and simmering popular music.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) recently avoided a $400 million budget rescission, providing temporary relief to global health advocates. However, the article details the significant uncertainty surrounding the program's future, as its congressional authorization has expired and the Trump administration has proposed major cuts for the next fiscal year. Experts worry that disruptions have already harmed HIV treatment adherence in some countries and that a shift away from prevention efforts could undermine decades of progress in the global fight against AIDS.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria to fight the spread of dengue fever. The bacteria prevent the dengue virus from replicating inside the mosquitoes, effectively stopping transmission to humans when they bite. A successful pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to build a new factory capable of producing billions of these "Wolbitos" to protect millions of citizens across the country from dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.</p>

          <p>The UK government is collaborating with Jordan to facilitate airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such deliveries. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated his government would "pull every lever" to get support to Palestinians, though aid groups warn airdrops are insufficient and can be dangerous. This action comes as Starmer faces increasing pressure from over 220 MPs, including many from his own party, to officially recognize a Palestinian state as a step toward a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>This article profiles several young Israeli Jews who are refusing mandatory military conscription as a protest against the war in Gaza, a decision that often leads to prison sentences and social ostracism. One 19-year-old, Itamar Greenberg, describes losing friends who now consider him a traitor after he spent six months in a military prison for his refusal to serve. The growing refuser movement remains on the fringes of Israeli society, where military service is a near-universal rite of passage, forcing these activists to navigate complex family dynamics and social alienation for their ideological stance.</p>

Because her eligibility for the WTA's insurance plan is tied to her participation, her break from the sport left her on COBRA, a notoriously expensive option for continuing coverage. The article explains how this situation reflects the broader issue of "job lock," where individuals are tied to their employment for benefits, a system that is particularly challenging for gig workers, athletes, and those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a growing epidemic of loneliness, particularly among its young people, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and social media. Studies show one in five teenagers feel lonely, and sociologists warn this can make them more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. Researchers note that loneliness can lead to feelings of rejection and resentment, which can pose a threat to democracy. The problem is not confined to urban areas, as those in rural regions with fewer opportunities for social interaction are also at a higher risk.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England over a pay dispute has led to the cancellation of numerous surgeries and appointments, causing anger and distress among patients. The article shares stories of individuals whose critical procedures, including for cancer and a rare lung condition in a child, have been postponed, with some fearing their health will deteriorate as a result of the delays. While the British Medical Association expressed regret over the necessity of the strike, affected patients describe living in limbo and feeling let down by the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>An attack on a court building in Zahedan, the capital of Iran's restive Sistan and Baluchestan province, has left at least six people dead, including a child, and wounded 20 others. According to state media, unknown assailants used guns and grenades in the assault before security forces killed three of the gunmen in the ensuing clash. A semi-official news agency has blamed the attack on the militant group Jaish al-Adl. The province, bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, has a history of deadly clashes involving militants, drug smugglers, and Iranian security forces.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a critical meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to avert a trade war, President Donald Trump urged European leaders to "get their act together" on immigration. Speaking from his golf resort in Scotland, Trump claimed Europe would cease to exist without stricter immigration policies and also criticized the use of wind turbines. Intensive negotiations are ongoing between the U.S. and EU, with a potential deal centered on tariffs for cars and pharmaceuticals, as both sides aim for a balanced outcome that provides stability for businesses.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural significance of Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs in the 1990s, portraying him as a formidable ambassador of Black cool who defined an era of ambition and style for a generation. The author describes how Combs's open display of hard work and his ability to bring Black culture into previously exclusionary spaces made him an inspirational figure. This admiration has now curdled into a sense of betrayal and heartbreak following recent revelations of his alleged cruelty and abuse, complicating the legacy of a man who was once a powerful role model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how climate change is transforming summer into a season of avoidance, potentially contributing to a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) typically associated with winter. As extreme heat waves become more frequent, many Americans are forced to spend their days indoors in air-conditioned environments, sacrificing sunlight, exercise, and social opportunities. Experts suggest this isolation and lack of sun exposure could be linked to depressive symptoms, creating a difficult choice between enduring dangerous heat outside or facing the mental health consequences of being confined indoors.</p>

The Dodgers are in urgent need of right-handed relief pitching, and Jansen is having a strong season, though the Angels are unlikely to make the playoffs and could trade pending free agents for prospects. Jansen, who spent the majority of his career with the Dodgers, expressed a willingness to pitch in any role for a contending team, making a reunion a plausible scenario for both clubs.</p>

The article contends that this backroom deal, which bypasses legal and institutional norms, sets a precedent for political repression and will likely be used to control other universities.</p>
