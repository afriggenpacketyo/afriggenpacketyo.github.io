          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyber attack. Initially affecting click and collect and contactless payments, the attack led to suspended online orders, with disruptions expected until July. While fashion items are now available for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, beauty and homeware products will follow soon, with services to Northern Ireland and click and collect resuming in the coming weeks. M&S estimates the cyber attack will reduce this year's profits by £300m, as some customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, was stolen, though payment details and passwords remain secure.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reported that over 100 people were arrested during late-night immigration protests. She noted that while the majority of daytime protesters were peaceful, "fringe groups" led more violent demonstrations and vandalism later in the night. Those arrested will be evaluated for active warrants. The mayor emphasized that the arrests were unrelated to the earlier peaceful protests advocating for immigrant rights and an end to immigration raids.

          <p>With millions of Americans facing unpaid medical debt, experts suggest exploring various debt relief options. Credit counseling, debt settlement, and debt management plans (DMPs) can help individuals tackle these burdens. Negotiating with healthcare providers and checking for billing errors are also recommended strategies. Experts caution against using credit cards or loans to pay off medical debt due to high interest rates and potential negative impacts on credit scores. Recent credit reporting changes ensure that unpaid medical bills should not adversely affect credit scores, provided other financial obligations are met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen police officers were injured in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following disorder that erupted after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. The violence, described by police as "racially-motivated hate attacks," included petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks thrown at officers, damaging PSNI vehicles and homes. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of riotous behavior and attempted criminal damage. Politicians from various parties condemned the violence and called for calm, while emphasizing the need to allow police to investigate the alleged sexual assault thoroughly.

However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient depot space in east London, which is also sought by other firms planning services between London and mainland Europe.

This proposal aims to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which has been a point of contention for President Donald Trump.

          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that could cut billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially causing millions to lose health insurance. A recent KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans. The House passed a tax and spending package that would cut $900 billion from health programs like Medicaid and the ACA. The Senate is now considering the measure, with potential implications for millions of Republican constituents who rely on ACA marketplace coverage. The self-employed nature of many Republicans and the lack of Medicaid expansion in red states contribute to this reliance.</p>

The ruling favors pro-LGBTQ+ nonprofits, who argued that the orders violate the Constitution.

          <h2>US Concerns Over Alienating Chinese Students</h2>

          <p>The US risks losing soft power by alienating Chinese students through visa restrictions, despite recently resuming processing of student visas. While many have highlighted how Chinese students have been hit by the ban, since they account for one-fifth of Harvard’s international enrollment, the visa restrictions imposed by the White House have sent mixed messages. In a phone call last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Donald Trump said the “US loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America”. Earlier, Trump said he welcomed Chinese students, but not those who caused “troubles”. It is still not clear what he meant.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is set to reduce its U.S.-based workforce by 3.5%, involving several hundred employees, as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures. This move comes amid challenges related to the decline of traditional pay-TV and macroeconomic pressures. The company notified staff of the impending layoffs, which may also affect the workforce outside the U.S. over time. The CEOs emphasized that these changes are necessary to address the current environment and position Paramount for future success, aligning with previous plans for job cuts and reduced spending. The layoffs follow similar actions across the media industry, including at Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old student stabbed and killed a 31-year-old teaching assistant during a bag check at a school in Nogent, France. A police officer was also slightly injured in the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack as part of a "senseless wave of violence" in French schools. Education Minister Elisabeth Borne is en route to the school to provide support. The attack has raised concerns about violence in schools, leading to increased bag checks, during which 186 knives were confiscated over two months, and 32 individuals were detained.</p>

          <p>The UK government is investing in small modular reactors (SMRs), with Rolls Royce selected to develop and build the first ones. These "mini nukes" are hoped to meet growing electricity demands, be faster to develop than full-size reactors, and create thousands of skilled jobs. The government also announced significant funding for a new large-scale reactor, Sizewell C. SMRs work on the same principle as large reactors, using nuclear reactions to generate heat that produces electricity, but are smaller and built in factories before being transported. The UK aims to triple nuclear capacity by 2050, but no new nuclear power station has been built since 1995.</p>

This incident follows previous drama involving Gio Reyna's parents after the 2022 World Cup.

The passenger also carried tarantula spiders and tortoises. This seizure follows a recent incident where dozens of venomous vipers were smuggled from Thailand. Wildlife trade monitor TRAFFIC warned of a troubling trend in trafficking driven by the exotic pet trade, with over 7,000 animals seized along the Thailand-India air route in the last three and a half years.

          <p>Congressional Republicans frequently discuss the deficit and federal spending, especially when Democrats are in power, but the United States collects significantly less money as a share of GDP than comparable countries. Tax cuts under George W. Bush and Donald Trump have contributed significantly to the current deficit. The Republican focus on spending obscures the fact that the U.S. collects less revenue as a share of GDP than comparable countries, and less than it has historically. With the Republican base becoming more populist and working class, there is growing support for raising taxes on high-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can harm or kill the birds they are intended to help. Spoiled sugar water in feeders attracts microbes that can cause infections, including candida, which can swell hummingbirds' tongues and lead to starvation. To prevent this, feeders should be cleaned every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. It is also important to use the correct recipe of one part refined white sugar to four parts water, avoiding other sugars, sweeteners, and red food coloring. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has written to UEFA to express concerns over Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. The issue revolves around UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Palace, also owns a 77% stake in Lyon, which has also qualified for the Europa League. UEFA rules prevent an individual or entity from holding a majority of shareholder voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament. Forest, which finished seventh in the Premier League, could benefit if Palace is deemed ineligible to compete in Europe. The club is insisting they are an entity which operates entirely independently, not within the structures of a multi-club model.</p>

          <p>US universities, including Harvard, are navigating ideological shifts amid pressure from the Trump administration, which accuses them of liberal bias and antisemitism. These universities are attempting to resist ideological subjugation while quietly sanding down their left-leaning edges.

The university is now trying to balance its academic freedom with the demands of the government, potentially engaging in a kind of “affirmative action” for conservatives.
