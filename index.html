          <p>Instacart has named Chris Rogers, the company's business chief, as its new CEO, effective August 15.

Simo, who will retain her chair position at Instacart to facilitate a smooth transition, highlighted Rogers' role in transforming Instacart into a profitable technology platform. Rogers, who joined Instacart in 2019, will also join the board of directors, as the company continues to navigate the intersection of technology and the grocery industry.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police have been granted additional time to interrogate a 53-year-old man from West Derby who was arrested after a car drove into Liverpool football fans during the Premier League victory parade. The suspect is being held on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving, and driving while unfit through drugs. The incident occurred in Water Street shortly after 18:00 on Monday, resulting in fifty people, including children, being treated in hospital after a Ford Galaxy evaded a roadblock by tailgating an ambulance responding to a separate medical emergency. The investigation is ongoing as authorities seek to determine the circumstances surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>PDD, the owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, reported a 47% drop in first-quarter earnings due to slower sales growth, falling short of market expectations. The company's Nasdaq-listed shares experienced a significant tumble as the report indicated that continued discounts to attract consumers would negatively impact near-term earnings. PDD's co-founder, Chen Lei, acknowledged that a slowdown in growth is inevitable due to increased domestic competition and external policy changes like tariffs, which create pressure for merchants. UBS analysts noted that management's tone is cautious, emphasizing macroeconomic uncertainties and substantial investments in the ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Power the Future, a pro-energy group, is raising concerns about several Biden administration executive actions related to climate change, suggesting they may be invalid because they were signed by an autopen without public confirmation from Biden. The group reviewed eight executive orders, including an Arctic drilling ban and a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, finding no evidence Biden publicly discussed them. The organization has sent letters to the DOJ, EPA, DOI, DOE, and congressional oversight committees, requesting an investigation to determine who authorized and drafted the orders. The use of an autopen has fueled Republican concerns about Biden's mental acuity, particularly after claims made in the book "Original Sin."</p>

          <p>Relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia have significantly deteriorated since Robert Fico became prime minister of Slovakia in October 2023.

Fico halted military aid to Ukraine and re-established relations with Moscow, accusing the Czech government of warmongering.

          <p>Denmark's parliament has approved legislation raising the retirement age to 70 for citizens born after 1970, sparking debate about similar reforms across Europe. Germany's pension system faces strain due to demographic changes, with economists suggesting raising the retirement age to 70 to address the issue. European pension systems vary widely, with the Bismarck model relying on contributions from workers and employers, and the Beveridge model funded by taxes. As populations age and workforces shrink, governments face pressure to adjust pension benefits, raise contributions, or increase the retirement age.</p>

          <p>A Vox article argues that the United States is squandering its "exorbitant privilege" with the dollar and its dominance in elite universities. The author contends that President Trump's policies, including tariffs and budget deficits, threaten the dollar's supremacy, while actions against foreign students and research funding undermine American scientific leadership. The article highlights the dependence of US science on foreign talent and the mediocre performance of the K-12 education system. It suggests that the US risks losing its ability to compensate for fiscal and educational failures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, ruling that the order violates the U.S. Constitution. Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, stated that an independent judiciary and bar are cornerstones of American justice. This is the third time a judge has struck down a Trump executive order targeting law firms representing his political adversaries. The ruling is unclear whether the Trump Administration will appeal Leon's ruling.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has determined that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) qualifies as "continuing and permanent," rejecting the White House's attempt to portray it as temporary. This ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by 14 states alleging that Musk's sweeping changes to the federal government are unconstitutional. The judge found that Musk's reach extends throughout the executive branch without known limits, and that DOGE had gained "unauthorized access" to "private and proprietary information." The court dismissed Trump as a defendant in the case.</p>

          <p>Recent college graduates are experiencing increased unemployment, accounting for 12% of the rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, according to Oxford Economics. The unemployment rate among recent graduates is nearing 6%, exceeding the national average. This trend is driven by a slowdown in hiring in sectors like tech, creating a mismatch between the supply of graduates and business demand. Economic uncertainty, largely due to President Trump's tariff policies, is also contributing to the slowdown in hiring. (not investment advice)</p>

Danan had struggled with addiction since his early 20s and spent over Â£1 million on rehab and recovery. His mother stated that he helped many but couldn't help himself.</p>
