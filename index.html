        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pivotal election viewed as a choice between closer ties with the West or a return to Russian influence, Moldova's pro-European Union governing party, Action and Solidarity (PAS), secured a clear majority in parliament. The victory comes despite what Moldovan authorities described as a significant "hybrid war" campaign by Russia aimed at destabilizing the country and swaying the vote. The outcome ensures continuity for Moldova's EU accession path, which began in 2022, and allows the party to form a government without needing a coalition, solidifying its pro-Western trajectory for the coming years.</p>

          <p>Officials have identified the suspect in a deadly shooting at a Michigan church as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served a combat tour in Iraq. The suspect allegedly drove his truck into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, opened fire, and set the building ablaze, resulting in four deaths and eight injuries before he was killed in a shootout with police. Sanford served four years in the Marines, reaching the rank of sergeant and specializing in motor transport equipment.

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group jumped nearly 16% in their trading debut on Monday after being spun off from parent company Sony Group. The strategic separation is intended to allow the financial unit, which includes insurance and banking services, to raise its own capital for growth while Sony focuses on its entertainment and semiconductor divisions. The successful IPO provided a bright spot in Asian markets, which were otherwise mixed, with Japan's Nikkei 225 declining while markets in Australia and South Korea saw gains.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Pentagon's defense acquisition system is dangerously outdated and bureaucratic, potentially jeopardizing the United States' ability to win a major conflict. The authors contend that decades of rigid regulations have stifled innovation and slowed the delivery of new weapons systems, while adversaries like China advance rapidly. The article advocates for the Dynamic Tech Defense Reform initiative in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which aims to prioritize commercial options, reduce red tape, and incentivize new companies to enter the defense sector, thereby revitalizing the nation's industrial base.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing blue-collar careers over traditional four-year college degrees, driven by concerns over high tuition debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating entry-level white-collar jobs. Skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, and welders are attracting Gen Z workers with the promise of job security, independence, and the potential for entrepreneurship without the financial burden of a college education. This trend marks a shift in perception, where trade jobs are increasingly seen as a smart and respectable career path rather than a less desirable alternative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal law mandating work requirements for many Medicaid recipients includes a key exemption that could shield millions of people living in areas with high unemployment. According to a KFF analysis, depending on how the Trump administration interprets the rule, between 1.4 million and 4.6 million enrollees in counties with high jobless rates could be exempt from the 80-hour monthly work or volunteer mandate. However, states must apply for these exemptions on behalf of their counties, and health advocates worry that some Republican-led states may choose not to, potentially leaving many without health coverage.</p>

          <p>In a move to support the private sector, China's Hunan province is implementing new regulations to tighten control over non-tax revenue, explicitly forbidding local officials from using fines as a tool to boost government income. This policy is part of a broader effort by Beijing to revive market sentiment and investor confidence by reducing the financial burdens on businesses struggling with a post-pandemic economic slowdown. The changes mandate that proceeds from confiscated goods be remitted to the state treasury and delink law enforcement performance from the amount of fines collected.</p>

          <p>An international team of researchers is formally recognizing a long-neglected form of diabetes, now designated "Type 5," which primarily affects malnourished individuals in impoverished regions. First identified in Jamaica in the 1950s, this type presents differently from Type 1 and Type 2, as patients are thin but do not experience ketoacidosis. The official naming, adopted by the International Diabetes Federation, aims to raise awareness, spur research, and establish proper treatment guidelines to prevent misdiagnoses that can lead to life-threatening complications from incorrect insulin administration.</p>

That single, quiet act of empathy provided a sense of stability that resonated for decades, ultimately shaping Eby's own approach to teaching and demonstrating how small moments of connection can have a lasting, positive impact.</p>

          <p>A surprising trend has emerged where jumping spiders, affectionately nicknamed "spoods," are becoming popular pets, particularly among women who were previously arachnophobic.

Owners are drawn to their unexpected cuteness and distinct personalities, finding that interacting with the tiny creatures helps them overcome their fear of spiders in general.

          <p>To counteract the effects of seasonal depression, also known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), psychiatrists recommend starting bright light therapy in the fall. As daylight diminishes, sitting in front of a 10,000-lux light box for about 30 minutes each morning can help reset the body's internal clock and alleviate symptoms like low mood and energy. Research has shown this therapy to be as effective as standard antidepressant medications for many individuals. Experts advise making it a consistent part of a daily routine to achieve an enduring positive effect throughout the darker winter months.</p>

          <h2>Archaeological Study Suggests Internal Conflict Led to Decline of Ancient Sanxingdui Civilization</h2>

          <p>New research on the 4,500-year-old Sanxingdui ruins in southwestern China indicates that an internal conflict may have caused the ancient city's downfall. According to Sun Hua, an academic director at the Sanxingdui Research Institute, evidence suggests a war for control of the capital occurred in its later period. This conflict likely led to the destruction of city walls, alteration of the water system, and the disappearance of key religious sites, ultimately resulting in a mass exodus of the population and the decline of the mysterious Shu kingdom.</p>

          <p>Typhoon Bualoi has made landfall in Vietnam, leaving a trail of destruction that includes at least 11 fatalities and a dozen missing fishermen. The powerful storm, with winds exceeding 80 miles per hour, ripped roofs from buildings, uprooted electrical poles, and caused significant flooding along the coast. In preparation, Vietnamese authorities had evacuated over 53,000 people to temporary shelters and mobilized thousands of military personnel for assistance. The storm has since weakened as it moves inland towards Laos, after previously causing deaths and flooding in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The emergence of effective but expensive weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is creating a two-tier system that exacerbates health inequalities. While affluent individuals can afford to pay hundreds of pounds per month for private prescriptions, access through the UK's National Health Service is tightly restricted by high BMI thresholds and subject to a "postcode lottery," leaving many without access. This situation disproportionately affects people in deprived areas, where obesity rates are higher, raising concerns that good health could become a luxury reserved for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>The UK's Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is set to announce new government proposals that would require legal migrants to demonstrate their contribution to society to earn permanent settlement status. Under the plan, migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain would need to meet new conditions, including learning English to a high standard, maintaining a clean criminal record, and volunteering in their communities. Labour says the policy is designed to emphasize integration and draw a clear distinction with the rival Reform UK party, which has called for abolishing indefinite leave to remain entirely.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD is implementing significant price cuts in Japan in an effort to stimulate demand in a market where it has struggled to gain a foothold. Despite opening numerous sales locations, the company has seen low sales, largely due to Japanese consumers' strong loyalty to domestic brands like Toyota and a preference for hybrid vehicles over pure EVs. BYD is now offering discounts of up to 1 million yen (US$6,700), a risky tactic in Japan where price cutting can damage a brand's long-term value and resale prospects.</p>

          <p>According to Russian reports, Ukraine has deployed a new naval tactic involving uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) that act as "motherships" for smaller, first-person-view (FPV) drones. These quadcopters are reportedly guided by fiber-optic cables, a technology that makes them immune to Russian electronic jamming systems that disrupt standard radio frequencies. This represents the first publicly known instance of Ukraine using fiber-optic drones at sea, showcasing a significant evolution in naval drone warfare that allows for more resilient and precise attacks against high-value targets in contested environments.</p>
