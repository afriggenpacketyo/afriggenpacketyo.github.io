          <p>The Trump administration announced the closure of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Services program, effective July 17. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration stated the decision aims to focus on serving all help seekers without segregating LGBTQ+ youth services. The Trevor Project, a nonprofit supporting LGBTQ+ youth, expressed concern that this action would eliminate life-saving services for over 1.3 million young people. Studies indicate LGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, making specialized support crucial for this vulnerable population. The specialized program had been providing 24/7 services since March 2023.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin stated his willingness to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and engage in discussions with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Putin addressed various topics during a meeting with international news agencies, including the conflict in Ukraine and tensions between Israel and Iran. Despite previous negotiation attempts, Putin has shown limited interest in halting the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Putin also offered to mediate between Israel and Iran, suggesting a settlement that allows Iran to pursue a peaceful nuclear program while addressing Israeli security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans for Iran but has not yet made a final decision on whether to strike the country, according to intelligence sources. The decision is contingent on whether Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. Trump stated he prefers to make the final decision at the last moment due to the volatile nature of war. Iran has asserted it will not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threat with a counter-threat. Israel began striking Iran early Friday morning, and the U.S. has assisted in intercepting retaliatory missile strikes.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that official U.S. records significantly underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans. The research indicates that the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Native populations is 6.5 years lower than the national average, with a life expectancy of just 72.7 years. Researchers found that 41% of AI/AN deaths were incorrectly classified in the CDC WONDER database, predominantly misrecorded as ‚ÄúWhite.‚Äù The lack of accurate data exacerbates health disparities, hindering targeted responses and funding for interventions and preventative measures.</p>

This disagreement has highlighted a growing rift within Trump's "America First" movement regarding U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. The debate echoes the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, with some warning against overstated intelligence to justify military intervention.</p>

          <p>Aaron Spolin, a Westside lawyer, has agreed to be disbarred for misleading prisoners and their families about their chances of release. Spolin pleaded no contest to misconduct involving eight clients, all current or former California prisoners.

A Times investigation revealed that Spolin used criminal justice reform promises to sign up thousands of inmate clients.</p>

          <p>Republican senators have largely aligned with President Trump's handling of the conflict between Iran and Israel, expressing trust in his judgment regarding U.S. involvement. Senator Lindsey Graham endorsed the use of force if diplomatic efforts fail to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Both Republicans and Democrats desire congressional involvement in determining U.S. action, though Republicans are less forceful. Democrats advocate for de-escalation and negotiation rather than inflaming the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Trump's request to have Justice Department lawyers represent him in the appeal of the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for defaming her in 2019 after she accused him of sexual assault. The DOJ argued that since some of Trump's alleged conduct occurred within his presidential role, they should defend him. Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24.</p>

          <h2>Passing Star Could Disrupt Earth's Orbit</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously thought, potentially disrupting Earth's orbit. Simulations indicate that isolated models of the solar system may underestimate future orbital changes. The study's authors say passing stars are the most probable trigger for instability over the next four billion years. While the odds of a collision are low, a 0.2 percent chance of collision with the Earth is much greater than previous research has found.</p>

          <h2>Heat Dome to Bring High Temperatures and Humidity to US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 17:33:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A heat dome is expected to bring stifling temperatures and uncomfortable humidity to much of the U.S. this week. The heat will be particularly intense across wide stretches of Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa this weekend. The humid conditions will make temperatures exceeding 90F feel as much as 20F hotter. Forecasters recommend minimizing sun exposure, wearing light clothing, staying hydrated, and spending time in air-conditioned spaces.</p>
