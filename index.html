          <p>Following two days of violent unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, police have deployed additional officers to the affected areas, as the violence resulted in injuries to 32 officers and the arrest of six individuals. The disturbances began after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, but escalated into what authorities describe as "racist thuggery" aimed at ethnic minorities and police. Police Scotland has agreed to send officers to assist in managing the situation, and investigations into the incidents are ongoing with plans for prosecutions. Many residents are reportedly living in fear, and the violence threatens to undermine the pursuit of justice for the victim, with some homes displaying signs indicating residents' nationalities in response to the unrest.</p>

          <p>CBS's "48 Hours" examines the death of Daniel Green, an Exeter, California police officer, and the subsequent trial of his ex-wife, Erika Sandoval. Green was murdered by Sandoval after he posted a photo on social media featuring his new girlfriend, which allegedly triggered a violent reaction from Sandoval. Sandoval admitted to the shooting but claimed she found photos of child pornography on Green's phone and feared for their son's safety, leading to the act. The trial focused on whether jealousy or a desire to protect her son motivated Sandoval's actions, raising questions about the role of social media in escalating personal conflicts.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of committing a criminal sexual act in a retrial in New York, while the jury acquitted him on another count and could not reach a verdict on a rape charge. The retrial stemmed from accusations of sexual assault by multiple women, reigniting discussions surrounding the #MeToo movement. Weinstein has consistently denied any non-consensual sexual activity, and his legal team argued that the encounters were consensual. This verdict follows a previous conviction that was overturned, and Weinstein is also serving a sentence in California for similar offenses, highlighting the ongoing legal battles and accusations against the former movie mogul.</p>

          <p>Some parents are adding their young children, even toddlers, as authorized users on their credit cards to help them establish a credit history early in life. Banks like Capital One, Bank of America, and Chase allow children with Social Security numbers to become authorized users. This practice aims to teach children about the value of money and responsible spending habits from a young age. Financial advisors emphasize the importance of a good credit score for future financial opportunities, such as securing better rates on mortgages and car loans, and some employers are even considering credit scores during the hiring process.</p>

He noted that a recent bilateral agreement could provide an opportunity for China to boost domestic consumption and become a more balanced economic player.

The studios argue that Midjourney is a "quintessential copyright free-rider" and that the company uses these images to market its services.

          <p>A review of the live-action remake of "How to Train Your Dragon" finds it lacking the magic of the original animated film. The remake, directed by Dean DeBlois, largely repeats the plot of the original, offering little new or improved content. While the message of empathy and questioning assumptions remains relevant, the reviewer finds the naturalistic approach less effective than the animated version. The reviewer also notes that the film's dark visuals and lack of wind in the flying shots detract from the overall experience.</p>

          <p>Faisal Islam analyzes Chancellor Rachel Reeves's Spending Review, highlighting its emphasis on long-term investment over immediate spending. The plan prioritizes funding for health and directs resources towards the Midlands and the North of England, rather than London. These strategic reallocations are designed to address years of under-investment, with the benefits expected to materialize in the long term. Reeves's approach stems from technical changes made to borrowing rules in the previous budget, enabling increased capital spending and a focus on sustainable economic growth.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) is set to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting production of vehicles currently made in Mexico to the United States. This move is influenced by tariffs imposed on imported vehicles and auto parts. The investment will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox to U.S. plants and convert an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks by 2027. The investment is expected to create jobs and boost U.S. manufacturing capacity.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Scottie Scheffler has deleted his Venmo account after being harassed by bettors who demanded reimbursement when he didn't win tournaments. This incident highlights a growing trend of athletes facing abuse from gamblers who blame them for financial losses. The rise of legal sports betting has exacerbated this issue, with some athletes and their families receiving death threats.

These countries are building an alliance system without the United States, leading to new defense and sanction deals. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that these countries share a goal of predictable, rules-based international affairs, which is no longer shared by the Trump administration. G7 organizers have planned meetings without the United States, as Trump will arrive at the summit at odds on trade and tariffs with essentially every other leader there.</p>
