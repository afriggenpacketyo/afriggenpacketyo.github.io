          <p>Gap's Athleta brand has appointed Maggie Gauger, formerly the head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new CEO. This move is a significant win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales and seen multiple leadership changes, but represents a considerable loss for Nike during a pivotal effort to expand its female customer base. Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran, was central to the company's strategy to attract more women shoppers, a key growth area. Her departure adds another layer of transition for Nike as it competes with rivals like Athleta and Lululemon, while Athleta hopes her expertise will reinvigorate the brand's performance and appeal.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat continues to affect more than 168 million Americans, with about half the country under heat advisories and warnings. The National Weather Service reports that the Midwest, Southeast, and parts of the Northeast are experiencing dangerously high temperatures, with New York City's LaGuardia Airport hitting a record 100 degrees. In many cities, the heat index is forecasted to exceed 110 degrees, significantly increasing the risk of health-related illnesses. Officials are advising residents to stay hydrated and in air-conditioned spaces, while some regions in the Great Plains and Midwest also face threats of severe storms.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other employees from the spa at his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking to reporters, Trump stated this was why he severed ties with Epstein in the mid-2000s, after warning him against poaching his staff. Giuffre, who later accused Epstein of sexual abuse, was allegedly recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell while working at the club. The comments come as the House Oversight Committee declined to grant Maxwell immunity for testimony and as Trump pursues a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a separate Epstein-related story.</p>

          <p>Spotify's shares experienced their worst day in over two years, dropping more than 11% after the company reported financial results that missed Wall Street expectations and provided a weak forecast for the upcoming quarter. The music streaming service posted a net loss of 86 million euros, citing increased personnel and marketing costs, and projected third-quarter revenue below analyst estimates. Despite an 11% increase in monthly active users to 696 million, the company's performance was dragged down by a decline in advertising revenue. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged the execution challenges but expressed confidence in the company's long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The disease, which can only be diagnosed posthumously, has been found in hundreds of former players, including high-profile cases like Junior Seau and Aaron Hernandez. This incident marks a tragic new chapter, focusing attention on the league's handling of head injury risks and its ongoing legal battles with former players.</p>

Companies like Novartis and Roche, with significant overseas manufacturing, are seen as more at risk, while AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly appear better positioned due to their larger U.S. manufacturing footprints. The exact tariff rate remains unclear, but analysts warn that levies above 50% could be punitive, potentially forcing companies to cut R&D spending or aggressively move production to the U.S. The policy has drawn criticism for its potential to disrupt supply chains, raise drug prices, and hinder innovation.

As part of the settlement, which is one of the largest of its kind, UCLA has also agreed to a 15-year provision prohibiting the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas.

          <p>Drugmaker Novo Nordisk's shares fell over 20% after it drastically cut its sales growth forecast for the popular obesity drug Wegovy, from a high of 21% to a maximum of 14% for the year. The company attributes the revision to the rise of cheaper, customized versions of the drug made by compounding pharmacies, which are legally permitted to create copies of drugs in short supply. Novo Nordisk stated it is pursuing legal action to stop this practice, as it has impacted the drug's sales in the cash-pay market. The announcement coincided with the appointment of a new CEO, Maziar Mike Doustdar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian airstrikes across Ukraine have killed at least 25 people and injured dozens more, according to Ukrainian officials. The deadliest attack struck a penitentiary in the Zaporizhzhia region, killing 16 inmates, while other strikes hit a hospital in the Dnipropetrovsk region and a line for humanitarian aid in Kharkiv. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the attacks, calling for tougher sanctions to compel Russia to stop the violence. The strikes occurred as President Trump confirmed an August 8 deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new, sweeping sanctions from the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing a long-held ambition to construct a large ballroom at the White House, a project he believes he is uniquely qualified to oversee. For at least 15 years, Trump has expressed his desire to replace the temporary tents used for large events like state dinners with a permanent, grand structure capable of holding a thousand people. He has reportedly reviewed architectural concepts and suggested construction could begin soon. While Trump sees it as a necessary and beautiful addition, some, like a former Obama-era social secretary, express concern that a large, permanent ballroom could appear tacky and obstruct iconic views of the historic residence.</p>

Legal experts and former prosecutors express concern that his prior role could create the appearance that the DOJ is being used to protect Trump's image rather than pursuing justice.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as “the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” which would repeal resulting emissions regulations for vehicles and other pollution sources. The administration claims this will save Americans $54 billion annually, while environmental groups and scientists condemn the action as a denial of established climate science.
