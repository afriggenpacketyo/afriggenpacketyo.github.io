Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, is considered a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. Nuno's departure came after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having guided the club to a high Premier League finish and European qualification last season.

          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a reform that makes lower-premium "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges accessible to most Americans. Previously, these more affordable plans were restricted, primarily to individuals under 30. By broadening eligibility through a "hardship exemption," the administration aims to lower healthcare costs for families and encourage uninsured individuals, particularly younger and healthier people, to purchase coverage. Proponents argue this will reduce premiums and stabilize the insurance market by improving the risk pool. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, has resigned following escalating anti-government protests that have turned violent, resulting in at least 19 deaths. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on several social media platforms but has since grown to reflect widespread public anger over systemic corruption and nepotism. Despite the lifting of the social media ban and the prime minister's resignation, protests have continued, with demonstrators demanding deeper political change and an end to the corruption that plagues the nation's governance.</p>

          <p>Newly released scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the Nation's Report Card, reveal a continued decline in student achievement across the U.S. The 2024 results show that eighth-graders' science scores and twelfth-graders' math and reading scores have all fallen since 2019, with the lowest-performing students hitting historic lows. This data comes after the Trump administration made significant cuts to the U.S. Education Department, which oversees the testing, raising concerns about both student performance and the capacity to measure it accurately.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation signed by President Trump, which includes substantial cuts to Medicaid, is projected to have a severe financial impact on children's hospitals across the United States. While proponents claim the cuts target fraud, hospital associations warn that the reduction in federal spending will directly affect care for children, who constitute nearly half of Medicaid enrollees. Hospitals that rely heavily on supplemental Medicaid payments to cover costs may be forced to reduce staff and services, potentially jeopardizing care for vulnerable pediatric patients.

          <p>At a recent BRICS summit, India's External Affairs Minister S.

The call for fairer trade within the bloc comes as BRICS members collectively condemn U.S. tariffs, though India's focus highlights internal economic strains even as the group presents a united front against protectionism.

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a U.S. court has decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser or other assets, despite finding that the company illegally monopolized the search market. The judge, Amit Mehta, argued that the rapid emergence of generative AI has fundamentally altered the competitive landscape, potentially disrupting Google's long-standing dominance. This decision suggests that the threat of AI-powered search alternatives, like ChatGPT, was a key factor in avoiding a structural breakup, marking a pivotal moment where AI's influence has reshaped a major regulatory outcome.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu is set to issue a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure funding for its aggressive expansion into artificial intelligence. The move allows the company to capitalize on relatively low Chinese interest rates and strong investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets. This bond issuance comes as Baidu seeks to bolster its financial flexibility and operational capacity for its AI ventures, following a recent report of weak second-quarter earnings which saw both revenue and net profit decline year-over-year.

          <p>Chinese authorities have fined the Shanghai subsidiary of luxury fashion brand Dior for illegally transferring customer data overseas without conducting the required security assessments. According to state media, the company sent personal data of Chinese customers to its headquarters in France without proper security measures, such as encryption, or obtaining separate consent from the individuals involved. This penalty reflects China's increasingly strict enforcement of its data privacy and cross-border data transfer laws, which place significant compliance burdens on multinational corporations operating within the country.</p>

          <p>Paris-based artificial intelligence firm Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion after a new funding round led by Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros to secure an 11% stake in the company, which is considered a leading European rival to OpenAI. This investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation and highlights the continued massive flow of capital into the AI sector. The funding will support the significant infrastructure required to develop and train the large language models that power advanced AI applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year jail sentence, overturning a previous arrangement that saw him spend his sentence in a hospital. The court deemed his transfer to a luxury hospital wing just hours after his initial imprisonment to be unlawful, stating he was not in a critical condition requiring such a move. The decision is a significant development in the long-running political saga of the influential Shinawatra family and addresses public criticism that the powerful receive preferential treatment in the justice system.</p>

This shift indicates that global companies view China not just as a manufacturing base but as a key global market for driving innovation and consumption. A recent HSBC survey of over 5,700 companies found that China remains the top target market for expanding global trade capabilities, with many firms planning to increase their manufacturing and operational presence there in the coming years.

          <p>This opinion article argues that populist right-wing movements, from the Trump administration in the U.S. to Reform UK in Britain, are actively attempting to rewrite national histories to serve their political agendas. By labeling historical accounts of racial injustice or colonialism as "divisive," they seek to create a simplified, patriotic narrative that justifies policies like mass deportations and the erosion of civil rights legislation. The author contends that this historical revisionism is a deliberate tactic to dismantle the democratic and social progress of the 20th century, urging resistance through cross-communal solidarity.</p>

The Trump administration's tariffs of around 25% on goods from China, where the phones are assembled, have fueled speculation that Apple may increase prices for the first time in five years to protect its profit margins. The new models are not expected to feature major technological leaps, following a year where Apple's AI-fueled software improvements were delayed, putting more focus on the economic and political pressures facing the company.</p>
