          <p>Scotland's A9, the nation's longest road, remains a site of tragic fatal crashes, with 48 lives lost on the Inverness to Perth stretch in the last decade. A US family, including Chris Strong's wife, her brother, and mother, perished in a 2022 collision, underscoring the road's perilous nature. The crucial project to dual the remaining single-carriageway sections, originally slated for 2025, has now been delayed until 2035, drawing criticism from affected families and safety campaigners. They argue that most fatalities occur on these undualled parts, stressing the urgent need for accelerated infrastructure improvements to prevent further heartbreak. The ongoing delays highlight significant governmental challenges and the profound impact on communities.</p>

Renowned for his memorable roles as Tony Soprano's confidant Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," Adler's journey exemplified a remarkable career pivot. Hailing from a family deeply rooted in Jewish and Yiddish theater, he transitioned from stage management to consistent film and television work for over 30 years.

          <p>SpaceX has postponed the tenth test flight of its colossal Super Heavy-Starship rocket from its Texas facility, citing an unspecified issue with ground systems during the fueling process. This scrub follows three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures for the ambitious vehicle, which is designed for launching thousands of satellites and eventually transporting settlers to Mars. The planned flight aimed to rigorously test various upgrades and deliberately stress the rocket to gather critical data on its capabilities and performance. This latest delay underscores the inherent complexities of advanced space development, impacting not only SpaceX's ambitious timelines but also NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship for future lunar landings, potentially challenging its 2027 target.</p>

          <p>President Trump challenged Maryland Governor Wes Moore to significantly improve Baltimore's crime situation before he would accept an invitation to visit, additionally threatening to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. This contentious exchange follows Moore's repeated criticisms of Baltimore's crime rates and his deployment of National Guard personnel to Washington D.C. Moore, however, dismisses Trump's rhetoric as "purely performative," citing a 20% statewide decrease in homicides and substantial reductions in Baltimore's gun violence under his leadership. The ongoing dispute underscores a deepening political clash over federal intervention in local governance and the politicization of critical infrastructure funding.</p>

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C. will begin carrying their assigned service weapons, marking a significant escalation in President Trump's domestic law enforcement crackdown. This directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reverses previous guidance that troops would remain unarmed during their deployment. While nearly 2,000 Guardsmen are stationed in the city, primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, their role has not involved direct law enforcement. The decision has drawn strong criticism from local officials, who argue the initiative is unnecessary given the city's declining violent crime rates, directly contradicting the President's assertions of an "epidemic of crime."</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency as the state's infant mortality rate surged to its highest in over a decade, reaching 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births—nearly double the national average. This crisis disproportionately impacts Black infants, who are twice as likely to die before their first birthday. Leading causes include premature birth and congenital malformations, deeply rooted in structural inequities like poverty, limited healthcare access, and housing instability. The emergency declaration seeks to expand prenatal services, regionalize obstetric care, and bolster community health programs. However, these efforts face significant hurdles from federal funding cuts and the state's ongoing refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.</p>

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande is slated for delisting from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a definitive and grim milestone in its spectacular collapse. Once valued at over $50 billion, the company crumbled under an staggering $300 billion of debt, becoming a stark symbol of China's protracted property crisis. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, faced significant fines and a market ban for overstating revenue, with liquidators now scrambling to recover assets for creditors. This delisting underscores the severe drag the property slump has exerted on China's broader economy, leading to widespread layoffs, suppressed consumer spending, and a strategic reorientation of government economic priorities towards high-tech industries.

Luckey contends that current US military technology is largely outdated, championing Anduril's innovative products like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the Dive XL autonomous submarine, which operate with advanced artificial intelligence and minimal human intervention. He dismisses widespread concerns about AI "going rogue," asserting that "smart weapons" are fundamentally preferable to "dumb weapons" that lack target discrimination.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, overriding local leaders' authority. This controversial plan, which includes arming troops, follows similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson vehemently condemned the proposal as "the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century," asserting that city crime rates, including shootings, have significantly dropped. Democratic leaders across various states argue that Trump's actions are politically motivated and represent an abuse of power, particularly given that official statistics often contradict his claims of surging crime in these predominantly Democratic-led cities.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly removed from his position as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a decision that reportedly surprised DIA employees and fueled concerns about the politicization of intelligence. The ousting followed the DIA's assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities had set back Tehran's program by months, a finding that contradicted President Trump's public claim of "decades" of setback. Senator Mark Warner criticized the administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country." This incident, coupled with the recent removals of other senior military officials, indicates escalating tensions between the Trump administration and its intelligence leadership.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) reportedly prohibited a resident from charging a visiting family member's Tesla in their driveway, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but primarily because the visible extension cord was deemed aesthetically displeasing. The HOA's letter cited vague aesthetic concerns and a questionable interpretation of the National Electrical Code (NEC 625), which actually permits standard Level 1 charging using manufacturer-supplied equipment. Critics and legal experts argue the HOA overstepped its authority, focusing on appearance rather than genuine safety concerns, and that their claims were legally dubious. This incident vividly highlights the ongoing challenges homeowners face with overly restrictive community rules, particularly concerning the integration of emerging technologies like electric vehicle charging.</p>

Kushner, who is Jewish and whose son is married to Ivanka Trump, echoed recent Israeli criticism of France's position on recognizing a Palestinian state, claiming such gestures embolden extremists and fuel antisemitic incidents. The French foreign ministry vehemently refuted these "unacceptable" allegations, emphasizing that ambassadors are not permitted to interfere in a country's internal affairs under the Vienna Convention. This diplomatic spat underscores deep and growing divisions between France, the US, and Israel regarding the Gaza conflict and its complex global repercussions, particularly concerning the recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A devastating multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula, California, resulted in four fatalities and two injuries on Saturday night. A black BMW M4, reportedly driven recklessly, veered violently over the concrete median into oncoming southbound traffic, colliding head-on with a white Nissan Sentra before bursting into flames. Tragically, three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed instantly, as was the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. The 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries, and a Sentra passenger remains in critical condition. Authorities are actively investigating the collision, with charges pending against the BMW driver, though alcohol is not currently considered a factor.</p>
