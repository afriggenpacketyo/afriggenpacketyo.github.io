          <p>Spirit Airlines is progressing significantly in its restructuring, having secured up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing and an additional $150 million from a major aircraft lessor, pending court approval. The struggling budget airline entered its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in less than a year due to mounting losses from high costs and weak demand, forcing substantial operational changes. To cut expenses, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft and 12 airport leases, alongside furloughing approximately one-third of its flight attendants. These crucial agreements aim to stabilize the carrier, ensuring its continued operation and future viability in the competitive aviation market.</p>

          <p>Nike significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal first quarter, reporting a surprising 1% increase in revenue, contrary to its own forecast of a mid-single-digit decline. The world's largest sneaker company achieved earnings per share of 49 cents, nearly double the anticipated 27 cents, and recorded $11.72 billion in revenue, exceeding the $11.0 billion consensus. This robust financial performance suggests effective strategic adjustments and resilient consumer demand, particularly in a challenging economic environment.

          <p>Congressional leaders are locked in a partisan blame game as the 12:01 a.m. Wednesday government shutdown deadline rapidly approaches. Senate Majority Leader John Thune attributes Democratic resistance to political opposition against President Trump, pushing for a "clean" continuing resolution. Conversely, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer insists on including the reversal of Medicaid cuts and a permanent extension of Obamacare subsidies, holding Republicans responsible if funding lapses. This deep ideological divide, exacerbated by a lack of direct negotiation, makes a federal government shutdown appear increasingly inevitable. The article highlights the political gridlock preventing a resolution.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has initiated a lawsuit against real estate giants Zillow and Redfin, accusing them of violating federal antitrust laws through a recent agreement. The FTC alleges Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to re-host its multifamily rental listings, with Redfin subsequently agreeing to terminate existing advertising contracts and withdraw from the multifamily advertising market for up to nine years. This arrangement, according to the FTC, illegally reduced competition in a critical market for renters and property managers. Zillow, however, asserts the partnership is pro-competitive and beneficial for consumers by increasing listing accessibility across multiple platforms.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit has been initiated against the Trump administration, alleging its unprecedented efforts to aggregate personal data from various federal agencies violate privacy laws and the U.S. Constitution. Filed by groups including the League of Women Voters, the suit contends the administration is creating "national data banks" in secret, risking security breaches and potential voter disenfranchisement. It specifically targets changes to the Department of Homeland Security's SAVE system, now repurposed as a citizenship lookup tool for U.S.-born citizens, which could mislabel eligible voters. This article highlights significant concerns about data privacy, governmental overreach, and the security of sensitive personal information.</p>

          <p>Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district in Des Moines, has resigned following his arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week. Roberts, who entered the U.S. illegally from Guyana in 1999 on a student visa, had a final order of removal and lacked work authorization after his card expired in 2020; a loaded handgun was found in his vehicle upon arrest. Concurrently, the Justice Department launched a probe into the Des Moines Public Schools' hiring practices, investigating potential discrimination based on race or national origin. This article highlights the complex legal and administrative challenges faced by both Roberts and the school district.</p>

Critics argue the plan lacks concrete guarantees for Palestinians and transfers the burden of compliance to regional governments.

Importantly, it showed good tolerability with modest gastrointestinal side effects and a low discontinuation rate, suggesting a potential advantage over existing treatments. While head-to-head studies are still needed, the results indicate MET-097i could become a competitive entrant in the lucrative obesity market, potentially generating over $5 billion in peak annual sales.

Experts warn this move could unleash a flood of claims, threatening the program's financial stability and severely undermining public trust in vaccines, as the scientific consensus has thoroughly debunked any link between vaccines and autism. The VICP, established in 1986, is a no-fault system designed to compensate for specific vaccine-related injuries without proving causation, but autism is not currently on its table.

The enhanced premium tax credits currently make health insurance more affordable for 22 million ACA enrollees, and their lapse would lead to significant financial pain for millions.

          <p>Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan proposes an international transitional body to oversee post-war governance, with former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair named as a potential member. Trump publicly praised Blair, who has been actively involved in drafting peace proposals alongside figures like Jared Kushner. Blair himself lauded the plan as "bold and intelligent," presenting it as the "best chance" for regional peace. However, Blair's potential role is highly controversial due to his historical involvement in the 2003 Iraq invasion, which severely tarnishes his reputation in the Middle East. Critics, including UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, question his credibility with Palestinians and his perceived alignment with US and Israeli positions.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman has officially filed for divorce from country music star Keith Urban in Nashville, citing "irreconcilable differences" after 19 years of marriage. Kidman, 58, is seeking primary residential parent status for their two teenage daughters, Sunday and Faith, as outlined in her complaint. The couple, who first met over 20 years ago and married in 2006, had separated earlier this year, with Urban having already moved out of their shared Nashville family home. The divorce complaint indicates their date of separation as the filing date, and they have also signed a "Marital Dissolution Agreement" that includes a parenting plan.</p>

          <p>For older homeowners, reverse mortgages offer a way to convert home equity into cash without monthly loan payments, appealing amidst high home values and inflation. However, this article warns against common pitfalls, including ignoring true costs like origination fees, mortgage insurance premiums, and ongoing property expenses, which can be substantial. Borrowers must also consider the significant impact on heirs, who will need to repay or refinance the loan to keep the property. It advises against borrowing more than necessary, understanding the potential effect on means-tested benefits like Medicaid, and crucially, seeking independent professional guidance beyond a lender's pitch.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally by adopting a policy targeting noncitizen pro-Palestinian students and faculty for deportation, violating their First Amendment free speech rights. Judge William Young's scathing 161-page ruling found that State and Homeland Security officials misused their sweeping powers to "strike fear" and effectively curb lawful pro-Palestinian speech on college campuses. The case was initiated after immigration authorities arrested recent Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, and the administration has since canceled visas for hundreds of students and scholars.

          <p>House Democrats allege the Trump administration may be "improperly" seizing defaulted student loan borrowers' tax refunds without providing the required 60-day notice, leading to severe financial hardship for American families. Following a half-decade pause in collection activity, federal student loan garnishments resumed, but lawmakers question if warnings issued years ago, before the pandemic, are sufficient. Experts note there's no legal precedent for such a long delay between an initial notice and the subsequent offset. Concerns are also raised about the accuracy of borrower data and contact information, potentially exacerbated by recent staff cuts at the Education Department. (not investment advice)</p>
