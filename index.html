          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deputies were members of the Arson Explosives Detail and were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that the investigation is ongoing and that this incident marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. Federal and local agencies are assisting in the response to the tragic event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones & Co., and two Wall Street Journal reporters. The legal action responds to an article claiming Trump sent a sexually suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003, which allegedly included a hand-drawn naked woman. Trump has vehemently denied authoring the letter, stating the words are not his and that he does not draw pictures. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a directive from President Donald Trump, the Department of Justice has formally requested that federal judges unseal the grand jury transcripts from the criminal cases of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This move comes after the DOJ initially stated no further disclosures were necessary, but reversed course citing "extensive public interest" and the administration's commitment to transparency. The request specifies that victim-related information and other personal identifying details will be redacted before any public release. This action aims to address growing pressure from the public and Trump's own supporters for more information.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a common gene variant and certain gut bacteria that can trigger severe intestinal inflammation characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by some bacteria over-activates an immune pathway in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene. This finding helps explain the variability of the disease and why some patients respond poorly to existing treatments. The discovery could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific mechanism rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>

Ogles accuses the university of pushing a "radical agenda" under a new name and potentially violating state law.

Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns warned that many educational and local programs will no longer be viable.

          <p>President Trump's decision to seek the unsealing of Jeffrey Epstein-related grand jury testimony marks a significant reversal, driven by pressure from his own base and a damaging Wall Street Journal report.

However, a report about an alleged bawdy letter from Trump to Epstein forced the president's hand, prompting him to pivot and order the release of documents. This strategic shift aims to quell the furor among his base and redirect their anger toward the media.</p>

          <p>In an interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency will use government data, including from Medicaid, to locate immigrants in the U.S. illegally, particularly those with criminal records or deportation orders. He also stated that while he is not a proponent of agents wearing masks during arrests, he will continue to allow the practice due to safety concerns for his officers. Lyons cited a more than 800% increase in attacks against ICE personnel this year, which he partly attributes to the agency's increased visibility and the prevalence of sanctuary city policies.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese officials and businesses are anxiously awaiting the outcome of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States, which could determine whether the island faces steep new tariffs. The Trump administration had previously slated Taiwan for a 32 percent tariff rate but paused the action for 90 days to allow for negotiations. Analysts suggest the lack of a final decision indicates that both sides are actively working towards a deal to keep any new tariffs at a manageable level. As a major supplier of advanced semiconductors to American tech firms and a country with a significant trade surplus with the U.S., Taiwan is in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>Prominent Democrats are questioning the motives behind CBS's decision to cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," suggesting it may be politically motivated. The announcement came just days after Colbert criticized the network's parent company, Paramount, for settling a lawsuit with Donald Trump, which he called "a big fat bribe." Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, among others, have raised concerns about the timing, linking the cancellation to Paramount's pending merger with Skydance, owned by the son of a Trump ally. CBS and Paramount maintain the decision was purely financial and unrelated to the show's content.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, citing him as a flight risk amid an ongoing investigation. Bolsonaro is facing charges of plotting a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. The court also imposed a curfew and barred him from contacting foreign diplomats or using social media. The move has intensified a feud with the U.S., as President Trump, a Bolsonaro ally, has demanded the case be dropped and threatened tariffs, a move Brazilian President Lula da Silva has labeled as "blackmail."</p>

          <p>The latest big-screen adaptation of "Smurfs" is being described as a strained and messy film that fails to capture the charm of the original characters. The review criticizes the movie for its chaotic plot, which involves an overly complex origin story, portals to other dimensions, and a random assortment of gags and songs. Despite a voice cast including Rihanna and John Goodman, the story feels disjointed and relies on the noisy, attention-driven wackiness common in modern CGI films. The article concludes that the movie is an incoherent vehicle for its message of togetherness and may test the patience of parents and fans.</p>

          <p>This article argues that members of Congress are increasingly abdicating their legislative responsibilities, particularly by voting for bills whose outcomes they publicly oppose. It highlights several Republican senators who criticized recent White House priorities, such as Medicaid cuts and budget rescissions, yet ultimately voted in favor of them, effectively hoping other governmental branches would fix the legislation. This behavior is contrasted with President Trump's clear vision for executive power, as outlined in plans like Project 2025. The author contends this "preening cowardice" from Congress allows the executive branch to seize more authority, a trend legislators may later regret.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% this week, largely driven by the enthusiastic endorsement of hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had previously invested in the company, posted on social media that he was back in the stock and believed it could be a "100-bagger." This sparked a massive trading volume, lifting the stock from near-delisting levels to over $2 per share, despite no fundamental improvements in the cash-burning business. The event highlights the significant influence of social media sentiment on speculative, downtrodden stocks in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the mechanisms for collection and reimbursement have not yet been established.

          <p>The Druze, a religious sect currently involved in violence in Syria, originated about 1,000 years ago as an offshoot of Ismaili Shiite Islam.

A core tenet is the defense of fellow Druze, creating a strong sense of collective identity. In Syria, the Druze have historically navigated a complex path, maintaining a degree of autonomy and armed militias for self-protection, and their relationship with the country's new leadership remains uncertain.</p>
