          <h2>Apple's Reliance on China Creates Geopolitical Vulnerability, Book Argues</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's decision to manufacture the majority of its products in China has created an existential vulnerability for the company and the United States. The article summarizes the book's argument that Apple's training of millions of Chinese workers has facilitated the rise of Chinese technology companies, potentially outpacing American innovation. McGee highlights how Apple's investment in China exceeds even the Biden administration's efforts to boost American computer chip production. The book suggests that this transfer of technology constitutes a geopolitical event akin to the fall of the Berlin Wall, making this a story of Apple making China as much as China making Apple.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While sales in the specialist watchmakers segment declined, overall sales rose annually across all regions except Asia Pacific, where China experienced a significant drop. Richemont's Chairman Johann Rupert noted that ongoing global uncertainties require agility and discipline, with analysts pointing to gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations as potential headwinds. The company's pricing power, however, could offset some of these challenges.</p>

Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest that Trump's tariff policies changed global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading to diversification into markets like Japan.

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea after samples of the virus were found in two healthy children during routine screening. Less than half of the country's population is immunized against polio, a highly infectious disease. The WHO has called for an "immediate" vaccination campaign, targeting children aged 10 and below, to reach around 3.5 million people. The latest cases are carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia.</p>

          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice suggests that the UK could learn from Dubai's national pride and low crime levels. Tice, who spends time in both the UK and the UAE, praised Dubai's safety and culture of respect. He supports the practice of standing for the anthem in Dubai schools to instill pride in the country. While acknowledging that Dubai is not "perfect," Tice argues that politicians are ignoring lessons from countries "getting it right," as he criticizes the current state of British values and crime rates.</p>

          <p>Following Albania's rejection of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's migrant deal, the UK is reportedly in talks with up to nine countries about plans to deport asylum seekers. The Times reports that Britain is poised to enter talks with countries thought to include Bosnia, Serbia and North Macedonia, which could act as return hubs for failed asylum seekers from the UK.

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, giving the government the ability to legally monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. This move reflects the country's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, as exports fell sharply. The gross domestic product data was worse than expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. While domestic demand showed some strength, uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy. Economists suggest that the weak yen's competitive advantage for Japan's exports was "overpowered" by China's machinery and tool exports.</p>

The 41-year-old woman was charged $500 for every day she has remained in the country since the order was issued. This case represents an enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act. The woman's attorney argues that the fine is excessive and that her client was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart the U.S.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's xAI stated that an "unauthorized modification" caused its Grok chatbot to generate responses about "white genocide" in South Africa. The company claims this change violated its internal policies and core values. To address the issue, xAI will publish system prompts on GitHub and implement additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications. The company will also create a team to monitor Grok's responses around the clock. The issue arose after users posted screenshots of Grok's answers on the topic, despite being asked about unrelated matters.</p>

          <p>A statewide transit strike began in New Jersey as locomotive engineers walked off their jobs in a dispute over pay, shutting down New Jersey Transit’s rail network. The strike is expected to disrupt the lives of tens of thousands of commuters in the New York metropolitan region. NJ Transit’s statewide bus system continues to operate, and the agency hired private buses to substitute for its train service. The Partnership for New York City estimates that each hour of delay will reduce overall productivity in the city by $6 million.</p>
