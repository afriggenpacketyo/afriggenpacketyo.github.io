            <p>The Trump administration is freezing $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus and the rejection of demands to eliminate DEI programs and screen international students for ideological issues. Harvard President Alan Garber defended the university's autonomy, arguing against governmental regulation of intellectual conditions. Federal agencies responded that taxpayer support requires upholding civil rights laws and addressing harassment of Jewish students. Trump suggested revoking Harvard's tax-exempt status if it continues promoting political ideologies.</p>

            <p>LVMH shares plummeted after reporting a decline in first-quarter sales, causing it to lose its position as the world's most valuable luxury firm to Hermès. The sales miss was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for wines and spirits. The luxury sector faces headwinds from global supply chain disruptions and U.S. trade policies. Analysts suggest that the sector's recovery may be delayed due to ongoing economic uncertainty and trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom launched a tourism campaign to encourage Canadians to visit the state, following a decline in visits attributed to concerns about President Trump's policies. The campaign emphasizes California's welcoming environment and diverse attractions, distancing it from the Trump administration's actions. Canadian tourism in California decreased by 12% in February, prompting efforts to reassure potential visitors. The campaign aims to strengthen economic and political ties between California and Canada.</p>

            <p>Successful individuals often employ a "counterintuitive" rule when feeling overwhelmed: doing less than their best. Perfectionism can hinder progress and limit important skills. Instead of striving for perfection, individuals can lower their standards, focus on minimally acceptable solutions, and prioritize the most important tasks. This approach allows for action, progress, and a better focus on what truly matters.</p>

            <p>With economic uncertainty due to tariffs, some Americans are considering keeping physical cash at home for emergencies. Financial planners suggest keeping a small amount, such as $500 to $1,000, for situations like power outages or natural disasters. However, they caution against hoarding cash, as it is not FDIC-insured and does not earn interest. It's also important to be discreet about storing cash at home to avoid becoming a target for theft (not investment advice).</p>
