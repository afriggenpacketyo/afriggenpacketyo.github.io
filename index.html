          <p>Manchester City, a dominant force in the Premier League for nearly a decade, is experiencing its worst start to a season since 2004-05 following a recent loss to Brighton. Despite significant summer spending and the return of key players like Rodri and a goal-scoring Erling Haaland, the team has shown uncharacteristic inconsistency. Coach Pep Guardiola acknowledges the team's struggles, particularly their tendency to lose focus after conceding goals, but maintains that the season is long. Historical precedent suggests a difficult path to the title from this position, raising questions about their championship contention this year.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has formally requested all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the Treasury Department. The request is part of the committee's broader investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking network and his subsequent death. This move follows the establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and the issuance of deposition subpoenas to high-profile figures. The committee has set a September 15 deadline for the Treasury to produce the requested financial documents.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker strongly criticized the Trump administration's plans to deploy federal agents, and potentially National Guard troops, for immigration enforcement in Chicago. Pritzker described the potential operation as an "invasion" that is illegal, dangerous, and intended to inflame tensions rather than address crime. He argued that such actions are un-American and disruptive to communities where many residents are law-abiding contributors. The governor stated that his administration has not been contacted by the White House and urged for coordination and federal support for local law enforcement instead of military-style deployments.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a revered CBS News correspondent and the unofficial historian of the White House press corps, has passed away at the age of 73. For decades, Knoller was known for his meticulous, self-imposed task of recording every presidential action, trip, and statement, creating an invaluable public record. His colleagues remember him not only for his encyclopedic knowledge but also for his generosity in sharing his data with fellow journalists, historians, and even White House aides. After a long career in radio, he reinvented himself on Twitter, sharing his unique insights with a large online following until his departure from CBS in 2020.</p>

Zirinsky recounts convincing Knoller to join CBS News and his eventual transition to his dream job covering the White House, where he became the unofficial record-keeper of presidential statistics. She highlights his obsessive dedication to logging every detail of a president's day, a resource even the White House itself would often consult.

          <p>Demetre Daskalakis, the former immunizations director for the CDC, has expressed grave concerns about the future of U.S. public health under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. After resigning in protest of the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, Daskalakis stated that he foresees harm from what he calls an ideological push to undo vaccination progress. He criticized recent changes to the childhood COVID-19 vaccine schedule and questioned the qualifications of the new CDC chief, Jim O’Neill. His warnings coincide with growing bipartisan criticism of Kennedy's leadership and the spread of questionable medical information from the health department.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay, the renowned celebrity chef, revealed that he recently had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from the side of his face. He shared the news on Instagram, posting photos of the bandage and stitches while urging his followers to use sunscreen. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to offer public advice, having previously advocated for wearing helmets after a serious bicycle accident. Dermatologists note that basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer but has a very high cure rate with early detection and treatment, reinforcing Ramsay's preventative message.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the administration has not ruled out expanding immigration enforcement operations to other U.S. cities, following recent actions in Los Angeles and planned operations in Chicago.

She defended the administration's focus on so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions and fighting urban crime, suggesting that city leaders should cooperate with the White House.

This follows his first hole-in-one, which he made while playing alongside his father at the PNC Championship in December 2024.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's inconsistent and improvisational approach to the Russia-Ukraine war has created a dizzying and dangerous situation for Ukraine. While Trump positions himself as a potential peacemaker, his vacillating statements on U.S. involvement and his relationship with Vladimir Putin are seen as an abdication of strategic leadership. The author suggests that Putin is exploiting this unpredictability, using diplomatic delays and confusion as a strategy to wear down Western resolve. The article concludes that while Trump has an opportunity to secure a historic peace through decisive action, his current dithering risks cementing a victory for Russian imperialism.</p>

The deal is expected to support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates designed to operate jointly in northern Europe. The agreement marks a significant victory for the UK's defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States who were also vying for the contract.</p>

Government lawyers contended the children were being reunited with parents at their request, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.

Rangers, despite their poor start to the season, showed resilience and organization, earning a much-needed clean sheet that may have relieved some pressure on manager Russell Martin. In contrast, Celtic's performance was notably feeble, with the team failing to create any significant scoring opportunities and registering an expected goals (xG) of just 0.17. The result leaves Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers with significant work to do to improve his team's attacking prowess before the transfer window closes.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest kelp restoration projects off the coast of Southern California has achieved significant success by removing nearly 5.8 million invasive purple sea urchins. Over the past 13 years, divers have cleared 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the vital kelp forests, known as the "sequoias of the sea," to regrow. These ecosystems, which had declined by 80%, are crucial for storing carbon and providing habitat for hundreds of marine species. The project, led by The Bay Foundation, demonstrates that manual removal of the voracious urchins can lead to a rapid and dense recovery of the underwater forests.</p>

          <p>Many vulnerable Afghans who were promised entry to Germany after the Taliban takeover are now living in fear of deportation in Pakistan. After fleeing Afghanistan, these individuals have been waiting, sometimes for years, for their German visas to be processed, but a pause on deportations from Pakistan is set to expire. One family described the constant fear of police raids and being sent back to Afghanistan, where they face persecution. While the German government has announced it is ending a freeze on admissions and resuming security checks, the process remains slow, leaving thousands in a precarious and dangerous limbo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to President Donald Trump, has sharply criticized a recent appeals court decision that ruled most of the administration's tariffs illegal. Labeling the ruling as "weaponized partisan injustice," Navarro warned that the country's future is at stake if the Supreme Court ultimately blocks the tariffs. The 7-4 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals found that the president overstepped his authority, placing a core component of his economic agenda in jeopardy. The administration remains optimistic about its chances on appeal to the Supreme Court, which will likely have the final say on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan aims to focus solely on "maximising extraction" to get all available resources from the region. Badenoch argues that current net zero measures are a burden on producers and lead to higher energy bills for households. The move represents a significant shift in climate policy and has been criticized by the Labour government and environmental groups as reckless and environmentally damaging, warning it would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering bills.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the right-wing backlash against Cracker Barrel for updating its "Old Timer" logo reveals the cynical and authoritarian motives of the modern culture war. The author contends that the outrage, amplified by figures like Donald Trump Jr., was a manufactured controversy designed to attack a company for perceived "wokeness." The article connects this incident to a broader strategy by activists like Christopher Rufo to "lay siege" to American institutions, from museums to corporations, using any pretext available. The author concludes that the goal is not to preserve tradition but to intimidate and enforce ideological conformity across all aspects of society.</p>

A decade later, the country is grappling with the complex legacy of this policy. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of the refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges related to integration, joblessness, and a surge in support for the far-right continue to dominate the national conversation.</p>

The article outlines six "magic phrases" designed to calm a child's nervous system and foster a collaborative environment rather than a confrontational one. Phrases like "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together" defuse shame and prevent power struggles. Others, such as "You can feel this. I'm right here," validate a child's emotions during a meltdown, helping them regulate and become receptive to guidance, ultimately making listening a natural outcome.</p>
