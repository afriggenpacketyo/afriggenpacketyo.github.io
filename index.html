        <p>The US Department of Education announced the layoff of 1,300 employees, reducing its workforce by approximately half.  This action, described by Education Secretary Linda McMahon as a step towards greater efficiency, has drawn criticism from Democrats.  The department will continue core functions like distributing federal aid and managing student loans, despite plans to close some offices and terminate leases. President Trump's campaign promise to close the department and Secretary McMahon's statements regarding potential cuts and reorganization are also highlighted.</p>

        <p>The US Department of Education is planning to lay off approximately half its workforce, impacting nearly 2,100 employees.  This is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government. While President Trump has previously aimed to eliminate the department entirely, this requires Congressional approval. The department's core functions, including funding for public schools and student loan administration, will continue.</p>
