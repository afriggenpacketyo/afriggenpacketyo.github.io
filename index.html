        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an attempted carjacking and assault on a former administration staffer, President Trump stated he is considering federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force. The president described crime in the nation's capital as "totally out of control" and said his lawyers are studying the possibility of overturning the city's Home Rule Act. This 1973 law grants D.C. a degree of self-governance, though Congress retains ultimate oversight. While Trump cannot unilaterally federalize the district, the threat represents a significant escalation in his criticism of the city's leadership and could be used as political leverage in negotiations with local officials.</p>

Lee Claydon, a landscape gardener and father, was described as a "hardworking family man" who was a lifelong fan of the band. He was attending the concert with his brother and nephews when the tragic accident occurred. While the venue has assured the public that it operates to high safety standards, the victim's father has echoed concerns from other attendees about slippery conditions and the adequacy of the safety barriers at the stadium.</p>

          <p>A grand jury has indicted the man accused of killing two Israeli Embassy employees in Washington, D.C., on additional charges of hate crimes resulting in death. Elias Rodriguez, 31, was already facing murder charges for the May shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum. According to charging documents, Rodriguez told police he "did it for Palestine" after the attack. The new indictment includes special findings that would permit the Justice Department to seek the death penalty, aligning with President Trump's directive to pursue capital punishment for severe crimes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that people returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii after the city was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. It is believed that some survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others seeking shelter, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. According to the site's director, this informal "favela" existed among the ruins until the 5th century. This discovery revises the long-held understanding of Pompeii's history, suggesting a period of reoccupation that was previously overlooked in the focus on the well-preserved artifacts from the moment of the disaster.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and computer chips to incentivize domestic production. However, he specified that companies actively "building in the United States" will be exempt from this significant new duty. The move is part of a broader strategy to pressure businesses to relocate their manufacturing operations to the U.S. While the announcement signals a major escalation in trade policy, specific details regarding the criteria for exemption were not immediately provided. This follows recent commitments from major chipmakers like TSMC and Nvidia to invest billions in new U.S. facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

His departure comes just one day before the finalization of Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of the historic entertainment company. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had previously announced its own leadership team for the studio, which will now be co-chaired by Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, oversaw major franchises like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible" during a tumultuous period for the company that included significant business pressures and ownership uncertainty.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes has been widely praised for his courage after batting in the final Test against India despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder on the first day. With England needing just 17 runs to win, Woakes emerged to bat at number 11 with his arm in a sling, stating he "wouldn't have been able to live with himself" if he didn't try. Although he did not face a ball, he ran four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India. His selfless act of putting the team first, even with a painful injury, has been hailed as an extraordinary display of sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that the true death toll from the Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County could be significantly higher than official figures. The study estimates there were 440 more deaths than typically expected during the period of the fires, compared to the 31 deaths directly attributed by the coroner. Researchers argue that official counts often miss indirect fatalities caused by factors like poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services. The findings highlight the hidden public health burden of climate-driven disasters and the difficulty in quantifying their full impact on affected communities.</p>

In a bizarre turn of events, the same woman was arrested the following morning after she returned to the location and was caught trying to climb back onto the same roof.

          <p>This article marks the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with a collection of historical and contemporary photographs. The images starkly contrast the utter devastation of 1945 with the vibrant, rebuilt metropolises that stand today. The piece recounts the immense human toll, with an estimated 210,000 deaths by the end of 1945 and long-term suffering from radiation. It also reflects on the legacy of the bombings, noting that the two cities remain the only ones ever targeted by nuclear weapons, serving as a powerful reminder of their destructive capacity amid renewed global tensions.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty announced a 30% drop in net income for its fiscal first quarter, attributing the decline directly to new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China. The company, which sources approximately 75% of its products from China, has been significantly affected by the increased duties. Citing the volatile and uncertain trade environment, E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year revenue forecast. The results illustrate the tangible impact of the administration's trade policies on American companies with global supply chains, forcing them to absorb higher costs or pass them on to consumers.

          <p>This article provides a comparison for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. While current interest rates are similar for both products, the key difference lies in their structure. A CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas a money market account has a variable rate that can fluctuate with market conditions. Given the potential for future interest rate cuts, the article suggests a CD may offer more security and a slightly higher guaranteed return over the six-month period, though it requires sacrificing liquidity.

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), has petitioned state regulators for a rate hike totaling nearly $10 billion over the next four years. The company argues the increase is necessary to ensure grid reliability, invest in solar generation, and reduce fuel costs. If approved, the move would represent one of the largest utility rate increases in U.S. history. Environmental and consumer advocacy groups have voiced strong opposition, arguing the hike would place a significant financial burden on vulnerable residents and is primarily aimed at boosting corporate profits rather than improving infrastructure.

Ukrainian prosecutors are meticulously documenting this evidence to build war crimes cases against Russia. As the U.S. threatens more sanctions, officials on the ground express hope but also pragmatism, acknowledging that economic pressure has yet to cripple Russia's military capabilities or stop its deadly attacks on civilian areas.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores President Trump's recent, and largely unsuccessful, efforts to divert media and public attention away from the Jeffrey Epstein case and his own past association with the late sex offender. The article argues that the president's tactics—including ordering supporters to stop discussing it, creating distractions, and selectively releasing information—have only fueled more suspicion and scrutiny. Each attempt to change the subject, such as his recent walk on the White House roof, is interpreted by many as a diversion, paradoxically bringing more focus back to the Epstein saga. The piece suggests that Trump's heated denials are feeding a belief that there is more to the story.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has had $584 million in federal research grants suspended by the Trump administration. The action was taken over allegations that the university violated civil rights laws by not adequately addressing antisemitism on campus. UCLA's chancellor stated that the suspension will be "devastating" and will defund "life-saving research" supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. This move follows a similar pattern of the administration freezing or pausing federal funding for universities, both public and private, over allegations of civil rights violations related to campus protests and policies.</p>
