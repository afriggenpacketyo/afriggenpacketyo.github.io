          <p>Former President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a nearly hour-long phone call to discuss the war in Ukraine, during which Trump reportedly pushed for an immediate ceasefire. The conversation followed a U.S. decision to pause some missile and ammunition shipments to Ukraine, a move that has fueled concern among those skeptical of Trump's commitment to aiding the country. The Pentagon described the pause as part of a pragmatic review to balance Ukrainian aid with U.S. military readiness. Ukrainian officials have stressed that any delay in support only encourages further aggression from Russia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard successfully intercepted and offloaded over $20 million worth of cocaine and marijuana at its Miami Beach base. The seizure, which included approximately 2,220 pounds of cocaine and 3,320 pounds of marijuana, was the result of four separate encounters with alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea. The operation was a collaborative international effort involving the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, and the U.S. Navy. A Coast Guard commander emphasized that such missions are a critical team effort to prevent illicit drugs from reaching American communities.</p>

          <p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries set a new record for the longest speech on the House floor, speaking for over eight hours in opposition to a major Republican-backed spending and tax cut bill.

He framed his lengthy address as a necessary effort to ensure the American public fully understood the damaging consequences of what he called a "big, ugly bill."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that a massive tax cut package championed by President Trump would primarily benefit the wealthiest 1% of U.S. households. The top earners in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, stand to gain the most, with average tax cuts exceeding $100,000 annually. The legislation extends the 2017 tax cuts and introduces other breaks for high earners and business owners, while also cutting social safety net programs. Conversely, wealthy residents in high-tax states like California and New Jersey would see smaller benefits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has announced it will take up cases from West Virginia and Idaho concerning state laws that prohibit transgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports. The court will decide whether these bans violate the Constitution's equal protection clause or Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. This move follows a recent ruling where the court's conservative majority upheld state bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors. The cases, which will be argued in the fall, place the Supreme Court at the center of the contentious national debate over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new comet, named 3I/ATLAS, that originated from outside our solar system and is currently passing through it. This marks only the third time such an interstellar visitor has been detected, offering a rare opportunity to study material from another star system. The comet was spotted by a NASA-funded telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles away, posing no threat to Earth. Scientists are racing to observe the object before it moves out of view, anticipating a future increase in such discoveries with the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p>

The verdict concludes a high-profile criminal trial, but his legal troubles are ongoing as he still confronts dozens of civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault and other misconduct.

Health experts attribute the surge in this preventable disease to declining vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for community immunity.

          <p>Following a recent war involving Iran and Israel, the Trump administration is promoting the expansion of the Abraham Accords to include Syria and Lebanon. However, experts express deep skepticism, citing the complex and active conflicts between Israel and these nations, unlike the previous signatories. While Syria's new leadership has shown some openness to peace, significant obstacles remain, such as Israel's control of the Golan Heights. Analysts suggest that a comprehensive peace deal is unlikely, viewing the diplomatic push as a way for Trump to seek a foreign policy victory rather than a realistic resolution.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that the Republican "One Big Beautiful Bill" could cause a self-inflicted energy affordability crisis by repealing clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act. With U.S. electricity demand soaring due to AI data centers and EVs, the bill would make new wind and solar projects significantly more expensive, stifling the main source of new power generation. This could lead to sharp price increases, more frequent blackouts, and disproportionate economic harm to Republican-leaning states that have heavily invested in renewables. The author suggests the move is driven more by political polarization than sound energy policy.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that prominent conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon do not genuinely speak for the MAGA movement, but rather project their own ideologies onto it. The article uses President Trump's decision to strike Iran, which was widely supported by his base despite Carlson's vocal opposition, as a key example. It argues that "Trumpism" is defined solely by Trump's own impulses, not by any coherent ideology from his supposed intellectual allies.

          <p>The Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap has rapidly risen from a Belfast-based group to a globally recognized and controversial act. The band, known for rapping about youth culture and a united Ireland, uses the marginalized Irish language as a political statement. Their vocal criticism of the British government and pro-Palestinian advocacy have drawn both acclaim and condemnation, leading to a terrorism investigation in the U.K. and calls for performance cancellations. Despite the controversy, the band drew a massive crowd at Glastonbury, solidifying their status as a powerful voice for a new generation in Northern Ireland.</p>
