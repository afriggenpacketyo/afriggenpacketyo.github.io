        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California DMV is seeking public comment on proposed regulations for self-driving vehicles, encompassing both light-duty robotaxis and heavy-duty driverless trucks. These rules aim to enhance public safety and foster innovation in autonomous vehicle technology. While Tesla has been promising self-driving capabilities, it has yet to obtain the necessary permits for driverless vehicle deployment in California, unlike competitors like Waymo and Zoox, which already operate robotaxi services. Shares of Tesla experienced a 10% climb amidst these developments, recovering from a previous dip. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While generative AI holds promise for contributing to scientific discovery, particularly in cancer research, its applications are more akin to a faster engine than a self-driving car. AI models can assist in summarizing scientific literature and identifying potential drug candidates, but they are not yet capable of replacing the extensive laboratory and human trials required to prove drug safety and efficacy.  Some AI systems are being developed as collaborative tools to help scientists judge ideas, and are showing promise by efficiently considering large amounts of information, while other AI tools can contribute to drug design by helping scientists more efficiently balance various molecular traits.</p>

          <p>California is experiencing a sharp rise in Valley fever cases, with the first three months of 2025 showing roughly double the 10-year average. The increase is attributed to cycles of drought and precipitation, which contribute to the spread of fungal spores in drier regions.  Health officials are concerned about the potential for a record year, especially as cases have been reported in counties that previously had low numbers.  Efforts are underway to study the disease and address potential resistance to antifungal medications.</p>

          <p>President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff met with President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow to discuss US proposals for ending the war in Ukraine. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov described the meeting as constructive and very useful, and indicated that possible direct Russia-Ukraine talks were discussed. The mayor of Kyiv has suggested that Ukraine might need to give up land to achieve a temporary peace with Russia after a deadly attack on the Ukrainian capital.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), days after researchers announced the funding had been cut. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it will restore funding to the 30-year study, which has led to discoveries in women's health on cancer, hormone therapy, chronic disease, aging, and osteoporosis. Researchers expressed concern that the reversal has thrown their work into chaos, but are hopeful funding will be restored without impacting other studies.</p>

          <p>Two recently published books, Charlotte Beradt’s reissued 'Third Reich of Dreams' and Laila Lalami’s novel 'The Dream Hotel,' connect dream behavior to real-world implications, proposing that dreams, though beyond conscious control, might be our purest expressions of free will. Beradt’s book documents the dreams of Germans during Hitler’s rise, showing how the Nazis infiltrated their minds, while Lalami’s novel imagines a surveillance state monitoring dreams to incarcerate potential criminals. Both works explore the idea that dreams, though private, can reflect or influence our behavior and societal control.</p>

          <p>Federal judges are reportedly concerned that the Trump administration could withdraw the security protections provided by the U.S. Marshals Service. The concern stems from the president's direct control over the Justice Department and a perceived rise in threats against judges.

          <p>Despite signaling eagerness for a trade agreement, China feels little need to negotiate with the U.S., believing it can wait out President Trump. China's intransigence stems from its greater need for U.S. dollars, the lack of allied support for America's trade war, and the greater political damage the trade war inflicts on the GOP. China's ability to compensate for declining consumer demand and its control over essential resources like rare earth minerals give it the upper hand.</p>
