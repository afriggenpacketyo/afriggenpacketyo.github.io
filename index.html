        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a significant campaign finance case challenging federal limits on coordinated spending between political parties and their candidates. Brought forward by Republican committees, the lawsuit argues that these long-standing restrictions are an unconstitutional violation of First Amendment free speech rights. This case follows a series of rulings where the court's conservative majority has loosened campaign finance laws, such as the 2010 Citizens United decision. A final ruling, expected before the 2026 midterm elections, could dramatically alter the landscape of political funding in the United States.</p>

          <p>Armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has led to a dramatic surge in sexual violence, particularly in the North and South Kivu provinces. Civil society groups and aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders report that fighters from all sides are systematically using sexual assault as a weapon of war to destabilize communities. Survivors face immense barriers to justice, and fear and shame often prevent them from reporting the crimes. The crisis is compounded by recent cuts in international financial aid, which have depleted stocks of emergency medical supplies for victims.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to release further details on concessions made to its proposed welfare reforms in an effort to prevent a rebellion among Labour MPs. Following a threatened revolt from over 120 backbenchers, the government was forced to scale back its plans, which originally included significant cuts to disability benefits like the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). New modeling suggests the revised plans will push 150,000 people into poverty by 2030, a lower figure than initially projected. Despite the changes, some MPs remain opposed, viewing the reforms as a leap in the dark without a clear understanding of their full impact.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's major domestic spending package. The procedure allows senators to introduce unlimited amendments, leading to a series of rapid-fire votes that serve both procedural and political purposes. Democrats are using the opportunity to force Republicans into difficult on-the-record votes regarding controversial elements of the bill, such as Medicaid changes. With a narrow majority, Senate Republican leadership faces a significant challenge in passing the legislation, which also faces an uncertain future in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced it will rescind its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies, a move aimed at restarting stalled trade talks with the United States. The decision came after President Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." The 3% tax would have affected revenues of tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta, and was set to be collected just as Canada announced its reversal. This climbdown is seen as a crucial step toward de-escalating trade tensions and focusing on a new comprehensive economic partnership between the two nations.</p>

The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combination vaccine but plans to resubmit it with the new efficacy data later this year.

The succession is a point of major contention with China, which views him as a separatist and intends to control the selection of his successor.

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, according to preliminary data, bringing Europe's largest economy in line with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in years. This development provides positive news for the ECB, suggesting that its monetary policy has been effective in taming price pressures across the eurozone. However, analysts caution that persistent service inflation and volatile energy prices remain potential risks to this disinflationary trend. The data may support the case for one final interest rate cut by the ECB later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany plans to make substantial cuts to its foreign aid budget for the second consecutive year, with the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development set to receive nearly a billion euros less in 2025. This reduction comes amid a global trend of donor countries pulling back funding, even as displacement and humanitarian needs are rising worldwide. Aid organizations have criticized the move as short-sighted, warning of devastating consequences for the world's most vulnerable populations. The cuts also mean Germany's Official Development Assistance will fall below its long-held target of 0.7% of gross national income.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a second major heatwave in June, with temperatures forecast to exceed 34°C, an event climate scientists say is becoming more common due to climate change. Analysis shows that days with temperatures over 35°C have occurred in half the years between 2015 and 2024, a significant increase from the latter half of the 20th century. Experts are clear that while a "heat dome" of high pressure is the immediate trigger, the intensity of such events is inevitably boosted by the 1.36°C of warming the planet has already undergone. This highlights the growing challenge of adapting UK infrastructure to more frequent extreme heat.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, reducing tariffs on key exports like British cars and aerospace parts. The deal allows UK carmakers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles annually to the U.S. at a lower tariff rate, providing a competitive advantage. However, the agreement notably excludes steel and aluminum, which remain subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a separate deal is not reached by a July 9 deadline. This uncertainty is causing significant concern for the UK steel industry, which fears being priced out of the critical U.S. market.</p>

This penalty means individuals facing unforeseen circumstances could receive less money than they originally contributed.

As the U.S. grapples with its own democratic instability and the rise of authoritarian politics, the region's long history of social movements grounded in the common good provides an alternative model.</p>

While the presence of great-grandparents offers families a valuable connection to their history and lineage, it also presents significant caregiving challenges.
