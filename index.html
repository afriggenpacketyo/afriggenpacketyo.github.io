          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai as part of a major trade mission involving over 100 British CEOs and leaders. The visit aims to expand business ties following a landmark UK-India trade deal signed in July. The deal is set to significantly reduce tariffs on goods like Scotch whisky and luxury cars, with projections suggesting it could boost the UK's GDP by £4.8 billion annually and create thousands of jobs. During the visit, Starmer also announced that three major Bollywood films will be produced in the UK starting in 2026.</p>

However, it also cautions that the war is not over, as crucial details still need to be resolved, including the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza, which present formidable political hurdles for all parties involved.</p>

          <p>Five water companies in England, including Anglian and Southern, have successfully appealed to the Competition and Markets Authority to raise customer bills further than previously announced. The regulator granted an average additional increase of 3%, arguing it was necessary to fund essential infrastructure investments, especially with rising interest rates on borrowed money. This decision comes as water firms face intense public and governmental pressure to address widespread pollution caused by outdated infrastructure and sewage overflows.</p>

          <p>Germany's once-dominant automotive sector is facing a severe crisis marked by slowing electric vehicle sales, fierce competition from Chinese brands, and high operational costs, leading to significant job losses. In response, the German chancellor convened a high-stakes auto summit with industry leaders to devise a survival strategy. Key proposals under discussion include extending tax breaks for EVs and potentially delaying the EU's planned 2035 ban on new internal combustion engine vehicles to ease the transition and protect the industry.</p>

          <p>The owner of Sresan Pharmaceuticals has been arrested in connection with the deaths of at least 17 children who allegedly consumed a contaminated cough syrup. India's Health Ministry confirmed that test samples of the product, Coldrif, contained diethylene glycol, a highly toxic industrial solvent.

          <p>This opinion article posits that Donald Trump's direct, personal involvement was the decisive factor in brokering the initial peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. The author argues that by leveraging his political influence over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and using regional allies to pressure Hamas, Trump forced a breakthrough where previous efforts had failed. The success of this high-pressure diplomatic strategy, if it holds, could signal a new approach for Trump's engagement in the broader, long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>This column asserts that the Dodgers' 8-2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 3 was a significant strategic blunder that has dangerously revived their opponent's hopes. The author argues that by failing to clinch the series at home despite having every advantage, the Dodgers have lost critical momentum and allowed the Phillies to regain confidence. The defeat now frames Game 4 as a virtual must-win to avoid returning to Philadelphia's hostile environment for a high-pressure, decisive Game 5.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies avoided a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-2 in a crucial Game 3 of the National League Division Series. After falling behind early, the Phillies' offense was ignited by a massive 455-foot home run from Kyle Schwarber, who had been struggling at the plate. Dodgers starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was unable to regain control after the homer, and a late-game offensive surge by Philadelphia against reliever Clayton Kershaw secured the victory, forcing a Game 4.</p>
