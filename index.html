          <h2>Germany Implements Stricter Border Controls, Turns Away Asylum Seekers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 06:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new German government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has begun enforcing stricter border controls, turning away asylum seekers at its borders with other European countries. According to Bild am Sonntag, 19 asylum seekers were among the 286 migrants and refugees sent back out of 365 undocumented entries over two days. The move is justified by Merz as necessary because Germany is surrounded by safe EU states where migrants should initially seek refuge. The policy has drawn criticism from German politicians and neighboring EU countries, who argue it violates European law and disrupts the EU's internal market, while polls indicate that approximately two-thirds of Germans support the measure.</p>

Ngumbi's mother, Bertha, worked as a teacher and farmer, instilling in her children the values of hard work and selflessness. Despite feeling resentment as a child, Ngumbi now appreciates her mother's sacrifices, recognizing that they enabled her to achieve a Ph.D. in entomology. In a conversation with her mother, Bertha explains that her high standards were driven by a belief in her children's potential and a desire to rescue them from poverty, and that she would make the same sacrifices again.</p>

          <p>A recently agreed ceasefire between India and Pakistan has been strained by renewed fighting overnight in the disputed Kashmir region, with reports of heavy exchanges of fire. The truce, aimed at de-escalating tensions following a recent gun massacre, was announced a day prior after high-level talks. Both sides accuse each other of violating the agreement shortly after it was declared. Residents in both Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir have reported intense shelling and uncertainty despite the ceasefire announcement, as both armies continue to blame each other for initiating skirmishes along the Line of Control.</p>

          <p>This article examines the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, detailing the rapid escalation and use of new-generation technology. The initial airstrikes by India led to a protracted engagement with conflicting reports of casualties. The conflict escalated over subsequent days, with both sides targeting sensitive military sites and engaging in drone and missile strikes. The United States intervened to push for a ceasefire, alarmed by the potential for further escalation between the two nuclear powers. The article concludes that the conflict has shifted the paradigm towards noncontact warfare, raising concerns about the future of conflict in the region.</p>

Donald Trump reacted optimistically, hinting at a potential end to the war on his Truth Social platform.

          <p>This article addresses concerns about capital gains taxes from selling a long-time home, especially when transitioning to assisted living. It explains that capital gains are calculated by deducting the tax basis (purchase price, construction costs, and qualifying home improvements) from the sale proceeds. Up to $500,000 in profits can be sheltered from capital gains taxes for married couples. The article clarifies that what you do with the money from the sale does not affect the capital gains taxes owed, and it suggests consulting a tax professional for personalized advice and exploring options like installment sales or renting the property.</p>
