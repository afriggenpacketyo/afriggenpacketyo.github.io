          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the antitrust lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's X and xAI against Apple and OpenAI will proceed in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to the area. Judge Mark Pittman, who has previously criticized the practice of selecting specific judicial districts for favorable rulings, sarcastically encouraged the tech giants to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth. The lawsuit accuses Apple of favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store and deprioritizing competitors like xAI's Grok. This decision highlights the ongoing legal battles over alleged anticompetitive practices in the burgeoning artificial intelligence market and the intricacies of judicial venue selection.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequently used by Air Force One during former President Trump's travels to Florida. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the finding, which appeared to be a hunting platform situated high in a tree across a highway, over 200 yards from the flight path. Although initial assessments suggest it had been there for months and posed no immediate threat, its discovery during routine security sweeps after construction ended raised concerns. This event highlights the constant vigilance required for presidential security, especially in light of a previous assassination plot targeting Mr. Trump in the vicinity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its seventh strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel, resulting in three fatalities, as confirmed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This operation targeted a boat in international waters linked to the Ejército de Liberación Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. The administration justifies these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug cartels, citing the severe impact of narcotics on American lives. However, this aggressive policy has drawn criticism from lawmakers, who question the legal and constitutional basis for these strikes and demand more evidence regarding the vessels' contents.</p>

          <p>Thieves carried out a brazen daytime heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, employing a basket lift to force entry through a window and steal jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The incident, which occurred during museum operating hours, forced an immediate closure and prompted a major investigation by French authorities. Officials described the operation as the work of "professionals," noting the thieves' quick escape on motorcycles after smashing display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon. Stolen items include crowns and necklaces from historical figures like Napoleon and Empress Eugénie, raising serious concerns about the security of national treasures and echoing past high-profile museum robberies in Europe.</p>

          <p>The fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced its first major test after Israel reported that Hamas targeted its forces, resulting in the deaths of two IDF soldiers. In response, Israel launched retaliatory air and artillery strikes across the Gaza Strip, which Gaza hospital sources reported killed at least 38 people. Hamas denied any involvement in the incidents, reiterating its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. Concurrently, Israel halted aid transfers into Gaza "until further notice," linking the reopening of the Rafah crossing to the return of deceased hostages' remains. This significant escalation underscores the delicate and precarious state of the peace process in the region.</p>

          <p>A California Highway Patrol vehicle was struck by metal shrapnel from an explosive ordnance during a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire demonstration near Camp Pendleton, an event attended by Vice President JD Vance. The shrapnel, from a prematurely detonated ordnance, damaged the patrol car while officers were managing traffic on I-5, which was closed for the exercise. No injuries were reported, and the Marine Corps ceased further live ordnance firing. This "unusual and concerning situation" has sparked calls for an after-action review into coordination between federal, state, and local governments, intensifying a political dispute between Governor Gavin Newsom and the Trump administration over the event's safety.</p>

          <p>China's top leaders are convening to draft the next Five Year Plan, a crucial blueprint for the world's second-largest economy from 2026 to 2030. Historically, these plans have profoundly reshaped the global economy, as seen with Deng Xiaoping's 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up" that led to the "China shock" in Western manufacturing. Later plans, like 2011-15's focus on "strategic emerging industries," established China as a leader in green technology and rare earth monopolies. More recently, Xi Jinping's "high quality development" (2021-2025) aims for technological dominance, leading to international bans on Chinese tech and diplomatic disputes, illustrating the plans' far-reaching geopolitical implications.</p>

These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with ministers also proposing an alternative to GCSE maths and English resits to reduce student demoralization. While the Sixth Form Colleges Association warns V-levels may not fully fill the gap left by BTecs, the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's emphasis on vocational training. The goal is to provide clearer pathways for students, allowing them to combine V-levels with A-levels or pursue apprenticeships.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a truly awesome and potentially greatest individual performance in baseball history during a playoff game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Ohtani pitched a two-hit, 10-strikeout gem over six scoreless innings while also hitting three monstrous home runs, including one that cleared Dodger Stadium. This unprecedented "10-strikeout, three-home-run game" solidified his status as a unique talent, comparable only to Babe Ruth in dual-threat ability. The article also highlights Ohtani's impeccable character and humility, describing him as "the perfect person" in Japan.

          <p>Millions across the U.S. participated in the "No Kings" demonstrations, protesting President Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. The peaceful rallies, larger than expected, showcased a unified Democratic, liberal, and anti-Trump Republican front, despite the party's limited formal power in national politics. While the White House dismissed the protests, the turnout and Trump's negative approval ratings hint at a Democratic opportunity to rebound from recent electoral defeats. The article notes the ongoing government shutdown, with Democrats using their Senate minority power to push for healthcare subsidies, a strategy that carries risks but has garnered public support against Trump and the Republican majority.</p>

          <p>What appears to be China's very large stealth 'cranked kite' flying-wing drone, unofficially named the GJ-X, has reportedly been seen in flight for the first time. Satellite imagery previously indicated a wingspan of approximately 42 meters, placing it in a rare class for stealthy uncrewed aircraft. The short video clip shows distinctive features like split rudders and a counter-shaded paint job, possibly for camouflage. While its exact purpose remains contentious—ranging from a large unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) to a high-altitude reconnaissance drone—its development signifies China's stunning speed in advanced combat aircraft technology, with much more likely progressing behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries campaigned at Black churches in Los Angeles for California's Proposition 50, a redistricting effort aimed at adding five or six Democratic representatives. Amid a congressional deadlock over healthcare subsidies and a government shutdown, Jeffries linked the ballot measure to gaining power against Republicans whom he accused of refusing to negotiate. The initiative, proposed by Governor Newsom, would temporarily bypass the independent redistricting commission to redraw maps, countering a similar move by Texas Republicans. This partisan battle over electoral maps highlights the high stakes in congressional control and the ongoing political polarization, with critics calling it a "big scam."</p>

Despite admitting "some luck," Amorim praised his side's spirit and resilience, particularly in securing a late winner after Liverpool equalized. While caution is urged given past false dawns, this performance has injected much-needed optimism and a foundation for Amorim to build upon, providing fans with a memorable day.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former US congressman George Santos, released from prison after President Trump commuted his sentence, described his time served as a "large slice of humble pie" but deemed the sentence "disproportionate." In his first interview, Santos lashed out at critics, dismissed intentions of returning to Congress, and called for a commutation for his former staffer. Trump's commutation, part of several pardons and commutations in his second term, released Santos less than three months into his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Santos expressed surprise at the commutation and, despite agreeing to pay restitution in his plea deal, stated he would only do so if "required by the law."</p>

Despite significant investment in new players like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, their contributions have been minimal. The team, once an efficient machine, now appears disorganized and prone to counter-attacks, dropping to fourth in the table.
