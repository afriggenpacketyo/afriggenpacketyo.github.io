          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," has released a new movie called "Mountainhead," a satire of tech oligarchs holed up in Utah. The film depicts billionaires who unleash deepfakes on social media, leading to global instability and contemplating taking over failing nations. Armstrong drew inspiration from figures like Zuckerberg, Altman, Andreessen, and Thiel, and the film explores the frightening power and philosophical approach of tech barons.

          <p>A slowdown in international travel to the U.S. is impacting tourist hubs, particularly border towns like Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, which relies on visitors from Canada. The U.S. Travel Association reports a 14% drop in international travel in March, with the biggest dip from Canada. Experts attribute the slowdown to stricter immigration policies, a strong U.S. dollar, and trade policies. Local communities are shifting their focus to attracting domestic travelers to offset the decline in international tourism.</p>

Critics say it is a dangerous plan that will force civilians to walk miles through Israeli military lines to find food, and likely accelerate an Israeli goal to displace people from northern to southern Gaza.</p>

          <h2>Medvedev's Proposal for 'Buffer Zone' in Ukraine Would Take Nearly a Century</h2>

          <p>Russia's former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has proposed a gigantic "buffer zone" in Ukraine to shield Russia from Western weapons. However, analysts estimate that achieving this would require seizing nearly all of Ukraine and would take approximately 91 years at Russia's current pace of advance. The proposal would also entail significant costs in terms of soldiers and resources. The ISW said its estimate also didn't account for a "number of geographic and defensive barriers that Russian forces would have to overcome to seize the remaining 80% of Ukraine."</p>

          <p>Xiaomi, known for its smartphones, is targeting Tesla's bestselling car in China with its longer-range YU7 electric SUV. The YU7 boasts a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, surpassing Tesla's Model Y. Analysts expect the YU7 to be priced competitively and to significantly erode Tesla's China market share. Xiaomi plans to announce the YU7's price at the car's official launch in July.

          <h2>Japan Implements New Rice Sales System to Lower Prices</h2>

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles via direct contracts to lower soaring prices, with a target of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The move aims to address public criticism of ineffective price control measures amidst rising inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. This new system also do not require retailers to comply with previous requirements that suppliers who bought auctioned rice would have to return an equivalent amount to the government.</p>
