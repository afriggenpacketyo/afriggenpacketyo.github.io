          <h2>Kraft Heinz to Eliminate Artificial Dyes from U.S. Products by 2027</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and immediately cease making new products with these dyes, following pressure from health officials to use natural alternatives. The company, which manufactures brands like Jell-O and Capri Sun, stated that 10% of its products contain artificial dyes and they have been investing in replacements. The FDA currently permits 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, though some states have enacted bans to restrict their use. The move reflects a broader industry trend towards healthier and more natural food ingredients, driven by consumer demand and regulatory scrutiny. The shift is intended to align Kraft Heinz with evolving consumer preferences and regulatory expectations. </p>

          <p>Despite Russia and Iran's strategic partnership, the Kremlin is unlikely to offer military aid to Iran in its conflict with Israel, according to DW. Although Putin condemned Israel's attacks and expressed condolences to Iran, analysts suggest Russia prefers to avoid regional chaos and jeopardize its relations with other nations. While Russia and Iran have deepened economic ties, including Iran's supply of drones to Russia for use in Ukraine, a formal defense pact is absent. Russia is reportedly open to mediating between Iran and its opponents, but its primary focus remains on advancing its interests in Ukraine amid Western distractions. </p>

          <p>The Senate is progressing towards passing the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a $250 billion cryptocurrency market. The bill initially faced Democratic opposition due to concerns about corruption and consumer protection, particularly regarding President Trump's family's crypto ventures. Bipartisan negotiations led to amendments requiring disclosure of stablecoin holdings by government officials, stronger bankruptcy protections, and Treasury monitoring of suspicious transactions. While some Democrats still express concerns, the bill is expected to pass, aiming to provide regulatory clarity and safeguard against scams in the digital asset space. </p>

The Vice President JD Vance spoke with Walz about the shootings and coordinated with federal law enforcement. The suspect, Vance Boelter, faces federal and state charges for the attacks, which have been described as politically motivated.

          <p>Downing Street reports a worsening situation with small boat crossings in the English Channel, with over 16,000 migrants arriving this year, a 42% increase from last year.

The Conservative shadow home secretary criticized the Labour government's response as inadequate. Ministers are urging France to tighten border security, while the Labour government has scrapped the Rwanda plan and redirected funds to border security. Despite increased interceptions, Channel crossings have risen, prompting accusations of blaming the weather for the surge. </p>

          <p>U.S. retail sales fell 0.9% in May, exceeding expectations of a 0.6% drop, signaling a pullback in consumer spending amid economic unease. The decline was influenced by decreased gas sales and concerns over tariffs and geopolitical tensions, with sales rising 3.3% year-over-year. Excluding autos, sales decreased 0.3%, while building materials and gasoline stations experienced significant drops. Despite improved consumer sentiment surveys, the ongoing trade war and tariffs have impacted consumer and business optimism. Economists suggest families are becoming more selective with their spending, seeking deals amid wariness of higher prices. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is introducing legislation to prohibit law enforcement, including federal agents, from concealing their faces during public interactions. This proposal comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) increases arrests in California, sparking protests and unrest. Wiener argues that masked federal agents create fear and undermine democracy, while ICE officials contend that face coverings are necessary for officer safety due to increased assaults and doxxing attempts. Critics, including legal experts and former law enforcement officials, argue that the state cannot regulate federal law enforcement attire.

          <p>Spanish authorities have released a report stating that the massive power outage in Spain and Portugal in April was due to technical and planning errors, not a cyberattack. Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen explained that small grid failures in southern Spain triggered a chain reaction, exacerbated by poor planning by grid operators who failed to replace a critical power plant. The outage disrupted businesses, transit systems, and internet connectivity, causing Spain to lose 60% of its electricity supply in seconds. Government analysts found no evidence of cyber-sabotage, but the incident has sparked debate about the role of renewable energy in grid stability, though officials maintain the country's commitment to transitioning to renewables. </p>

          <p>The recent deployment of active-duty U.S. military in Los Angeles raises concerns given the rarity and potential perils of such actions, drawing parallels to the period from 1957 to 1968 when military forces patrolled U.S. soil on eight occasions. While past deployments resulted in few fatalities due to bipartisan consensus and well-planned rules of engagement, today's political climate is more polarized, potentially undermining restraint. The absence of military police trained in crowd control alongside deployed marines is a departure from past practice, adding to the unease. The Army's historical restraint was rooted in political elites' trust in apolitical expertise and the development of procedures aimed at minimizing force, but the current administration's actions raise doubts about adherence to these guidelines. </p>

          <p>A doctor charged with providing Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the actor's death has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine. The agreement, filed in court, stipulates that prosecutors will drop additional charges in exchange for the plea, which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. According to court documents, the doctor referred to Perry as a "moron" to be exploited for money. Perry's death was attributed to the acute effects of ketamine, with contributing factors including drowning and coronary artery disease; he had been seeking more ketamine than his regular doctor would prescribe. The case highlights the dangers of off-label ketamine use and the potential for exploitation of individuals struggling with addiction. </p>

          <p>Experts are discussing whether gold could reach $4,000 per ounce, citing factors like inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, and central bank buying. Ben Nadelstein suggests that if gold maintains its percentage gains from last year, hitting $4,000 in 2025 is possible. Brandon Aversano expects gold to reach $4,000 within a year, pointing to global instability and strong central bank demand. Thomas Winmill takes a more measured approach, suggesting it may take one to two years without a serious geopolitical event. Strategies for investing in gold include maintaining a long-term outlook, leasing out gold, and considering gold mining mutual funds. (not investment advice) </p>
