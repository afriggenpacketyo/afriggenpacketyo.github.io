          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:23:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has released declassified documents related to the 2016 election, claiming they show evidence of a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials to undermine Donald Trump. The move has reignited partisan conflict, with Democrats accusing Gabbard of misrepresenting intelligence and dangerously politicizing her role. Critics argue the released materials do not change the fundamental conclusion of multiple investigations that Russia conducted an influence campaign to aid Trump's candidacy. The release was praised by President Trump and his allies, who see it as vindication of their long-held grievances against the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a large collection of previously classified documents related to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., including extensive FBI surveillance files. The release, which had been blocked since 1977, was met with mixed reactions from King's family, with some condemning it as a potential misuse of information intended to undermine his legacy. The documents offer a deeper look into the government's invasive monitoring of the civil rights leader, a campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover. The release fulfills a campaign promise by President Trump to declassify files on major assassinations from the 1960s.</p>

          <h2>Former Officer Sentenced to Nearly Three Years for Role in Breonna Taylor Killing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:14:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge sentenced former Kentucky police officer Brett Hankison to 33 months in prison for his role in the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. Hankison was convicted of violating Taylor's civil rights by using excessive force when he fired ten shots into her apartment, though none of his bullets struck her. The judge's decision for significant prison time directly countered a Justice Department recommendation for a sentence of time served, which the judge called inappropriate. This marks the first prison sentence for any officer involved in the high-profile case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly utilizing the judicial system and executive orders to enact its policy goals, reshaping the balance of power between the presidency and the courts. A series of favorable Supreme Court rulings have emboldened the administration, which has also launched a rhetorical assault on lower court judges who have blocked its initiatives. This strategy has led to concerns among legal experts and former judges about an unprecedented attack on judicial independence and a rise in threats against the judiciary.

          <p>A new analysis from The Atlantic argues that President Trump's second term is primarily driven by personal pettiness and retribution rather than a coherent policy agenda. The article cites numerous examples, including the renaming of military bases, purges of perceived enemies within government agencies like the FBI, and erratic shifts in foreign policy toward Ukraine. According to the author, these actions stem from Trump's emotional reactions and desire to settle personal scores, particularly with his predecessor Barack Obama. This approach, the article contends, creates a chaotic and vengeful atmosphere within the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic figures for the first half of 2025, many citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of wage stagnation and job insecurity. The article highlights personal stories, such as an accountant in Chengdu who has not had a raise in five years and fears being laid off, illustrating a growing disconnect. Experts note that while official data may appear positive, the sentiment among households and businesses reflects a weak job market and significant uncertainty about the future. This challenges the government's narrative of a strong economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The federal judge assigned to President Trump's $10 billion libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch is the same judge who presided over Trump's previous lawsuit against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Judge Darrin Gayles' assignment raises the possibility that Trump could again face a deposition under oath, a situation that preceded his decision to voluntarily drop the Cohen case. The new lawsuit concerns a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein, and a deposition could force Trump to answer questions about his past relationship with the deceased sex offender.</p>

          <p>At the urging of the Trump administration, the Texas Legislature is meeting in a special session to potentially redraw the state's congressional district map. The goal is to create more Republican-leaning districts to help the GOP maintain its narrow majority in the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections. The move is highly unusual, coming mid-decade and after the state already implemented a new map following the 2020 Census. Critics argue the effort is a politically motivated gerrymander that could illegally dilute the voting power of minority communities and is likely to face immediate legal challenges.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's recently signed tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, with the resulting $4.5 trillion in lost revenue only partially offset by $1.1 trillion in cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. These cuts are expected to leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034, while the bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston federal court over the government's decision to freeze over $2 billion in federal research grants.

Judge Allison Burroughs expressed skepticism about how cutting funds for medical research would address anti-Jewish bias, calling the government's claims "mind-boggling."
