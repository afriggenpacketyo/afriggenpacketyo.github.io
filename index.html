        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The platform Substack is experiencing a surge in popularity within the literary world, becoming a vital space for discourse and discovery for both established and emerging writers. Unlike short-form video platforms, it fosters in-depth conversations and has helped lesser-known authors gain significant media attention for their new novels, a phenomenon dubbed "Substack summer." This trend is seen by many as a revival of the early 2000s blogosphere culture, providing a monetizable connection between writers and readers in a struggling book media ecosystem. Many authors credit the platform for creating a vibrant, supportive literary scene that has been diminishing in traditional media.</p>

          <p>A cluster of Legionnaires' disease in the Harlem area of New York City has resulted in two deaths and at least 58 confirmed illnesses. Health officials are urging residents, especially those over 50 or with compromised immune systems, to seek immediate medical care for flu-like symptoms. The disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria found in warm water systems, is not transmissible from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics. The city's health department has completed remediation of 11 cooling towers that initially tested positive for the bacteria as part of its ongoing investigation into the source of the outbreak.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street expectations, largely due to declining sales in its U.S. operations for KFC and Pizza Hut. Both chains saw a 5% drop in domestic same-store sales, facing stiff competition and reduced consumer spending on dining out. While international performance for KFC helped its overall figures, the domestic struggles highlight significant challenges for the company. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, with a 4% increase in same-store sales globally, solidifying its position as a strong performer in Yum's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Storm Floris, which brought gusts of up to 90 mph, thousands of homes in Scotland remain without electricity and train services are suspended. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) reported that 22,000 homes were still without power, though 50,000 have been restored, calling it the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. The disruption, primarily caused by fallen trees, has led to numerous flight and train cancellations. While most power is expected to be restored soon, some complex repairs may extend into the week, and authorities are providing support with welfare vans and meal reimbursements for affected customers.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Flood of Nebraska encountered a hostile audience during a town hall in Lincoln, where he was repeatedly heckled while defending his support for President Trump's recent major policy and tax bill. The crowd expressed strong disapproval of the bill's provisions, particularly its impact on Medicaid and tax policies, with chants of "Tax the Rich!" and "vote him out!" erupting throughout the event. Flood argued the bill was a middle-class tax cut and that changes to Medicaid were aimed at able-bodied adults who refuse to work. Despite his attempts to explain his vote, the audience remained largely unsatisfied with his responses.</p>

          <p>Pfizer raised its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong business performance, which caused its shares to rise in premarket trading. The pharmaceutical company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs like Vyndaqel. The updated outlook now projects adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive forecast comes as the company navigates potential impacts from the Trump administration's calls for lower drug prices and planned tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.

          <p>Russia has entered the trade dispute between the United States and India, with the Kremlin stating that India is a sovereign nation with the right to choose its own economic partners. This statement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose significantly higher tariffs on India if it continues to purchase Russian oil. The Kremlin dismissed these threats as illegitimate attempts to force countries to sever trade relations with Russia. Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, India has become a major importer of discounted Russian crude oil, a practice that has created tension with Washington's efforts to isolate Moscow economically.</p>

          <p>The July jobs report, which showed a meager 73,000 nonfarm payrolls added and included significant downward revisions for the previous two months, has intensified concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing sharply.

This weak labor market data, combined with pressures from tariffs that could depress consumer spending and business investment, paints a gloomy outlook despite a seemingly strong second-quarter GDP figure.

          <p>This article delves into the complex question of what constitutes "evil," using the case of Bryan Kohberger, convicted of the University of Idaho murders, as a starting point. The author challenges the simple application of the label "evil," arguing it can be a way to stop thinking critically about the root causes of violence. Comparing Kohberger's case to that of the 1966 Texas tower sniper, who had a brain tumor, the essay explores how biological and environmental factors can influence horrific actions. Ultimately, it suggests that a deeper, more compassionate understanding of human dysfunction is necessary to prevent future tragedies, rather than relying on simplistic labels and vengeance.</p>

An informal alliance of rural and urban educators, along with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, pushed back against the hold, arguing it disrupted hiring and planning for the school year.

He is scheduled to appear in court in mid-August to face these allegations. In a separate legal matter, Blades has also denied a charge of controlling or coercive behavior, for which he is currently on conditional bail. The presenter, who gained fame since the show's 2017 launch and received an MBE in 2021, stepped back from his hosting duties last year amid these developing legal issues.</p>

          <p>China's beleaguered property market may be approaching its bottom, according to analysts who point to a resumption of credit flow to developers and a decrease in the inventory of unsold homes. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast for the decline in new home sales for the year from 15% to a more moderate 7%, citing a better-than-expected first half. The market has seen rapid consolidation, with state-owned developers increasing their market share, a factor that HSBC suggests has been key to stabilizing the sector. These developments are providing a glimmer of hope for a potential recovery in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Explainer Delves into the Strategic Debate on Whether a Nuclear War Can Be 'Won'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the complex and resurgent debate over whether a nuclear war could be fought and won on a limited scale, challenging the long-held maxim that such a conflict is inherently unwinnable. It contrasts the Cold War doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) with the concept of Nuclear Utilization Target Selection (NUTS), where tactical nuclear weapons could be used to achieve specific military goals without escalating to global annihilation. As superpowers like the U.S., Russia, and China modernize their arsenals with lower-yield options, some strategists argue for preparing for limited nuclear conflict to maintain deterrence, while critics warn this thinking makes such a catastrophic war more likely.</p>

          <p>Despite recent airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza by several countries, humanitarian organizations and local Palestinians report that the method is insufficient, dangerous, and poorly distributed. Residents describe chaotic scenes where only the strongest can access the supplies, some of which land in hard-to-reach or militarized zones. Aid groups like the UNRWA consider airdrops a costly and inefficient last resort compared to land deliveries via trucks, which can carry more aid safely. The UN and foreign officials continue to call on Israel to fully open land crossings to prevent mass starvation as the humanitarian crisis deepens and malnutrition-related deaths rise.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that police guidance regarding the disclosure of personal information about crime suspects, including their immigration status and ethnicity, "needs to change." Her comments follow a debate surrounding a case in Warwickshire where two men, reportedly Afghan nationals, were arrested for the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl. While acknowledging that it is an operational decision during a live investigation, Cooper emphasized the need for greater transparency to provide local communities with more information.

According to the official notice, this 12-month program is designed to curb visa overstays and will target individuals from countries with high overstay rates or where security screening is considered deficient. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader agenda to tighten immigration controls.

          <p>Byron Black, a 69-year-old triple-killer, is scheduled to be executed in Tennessee by lethal injection, making him the first person to be put to death with a functioning defibrillator implanted in his chest. His lawyers had sought a delay, arguing that the device could deliver an electric shock during the execution, potentially causing unnecessary suffering and prolonging his death. Despite a lower court judge initially agreeing, the state Supreme Court overturned the order to deactivate the device. State lawyers contend the lethal injection protocol will not trigger the implant, but the case raises new questions about the execution process.</p>

The piece contends that these silos are monuments to a time when human extinction was a core part of national security strategy.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration's proposal to rescind the EPA's 2009 "endangerment finding" is its most radical anti-climate action yet. This finding, which concludes that greenhouse gases harm human health, is the legal foundation for all major federal climate regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and power plants. By attempting to remove it, the administration is effectively repudiating the federal government's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The author claims this move defies scientific consensus and legal precedent, and even if it fails in court, it will paralyze crucial climate action for years, leaving the U.S. behind in clean energy innovation.</p>
