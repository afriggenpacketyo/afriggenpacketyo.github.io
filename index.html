            <p>NASA astronaut Don Pettit, celebrating his 70th birthday with a landing, along with cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, returned to Earth after a 220-day mission on the International Space Station. The trio's Soyuz spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan, marking the end of their expedition, during which they orbited the Earth 3,520 times, traveling 93.3 million miles. Their return facilitates a crew rotation involving SpaceX Crew 10 and Soyuz replacements, while concerns regarding the ISS's aging infrastructure and budget shortfalls are increasingly discussed. The ISS faces risks related to air leaks and the need for a dedicated deorbit vehicle to ensure safe disposal in 2030.</p>

            <p>Thousands of protesters participated in a "National Day of Action" across all 50 U.S. states and territories, targeting President Donald Trump's policies. Organized by the "50501" movement, over 700 events took place, addressing concerns such as civil rights rollbacks, executive power, and deportations. Demonstrators in Washington, D.C., marched near the White House, while others protested Elon Musk's role as a Trump advisor and Tesla's government efficiency initiatives. The protests coincided with the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, drawing parallels between the current political climate and the American Revolution.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on the deportations of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, responding to an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting. This action follows concerns that immigration authorities were resuming deportations under the AEA without allowing detainees to argue their cases in court, as previously mandated by the Supreme Court.</p>

While Kyiv stated it would adhere to the truce, Zelensky reported ongoing fighting in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions, as well as continued use of Russian drones. Ukraine remains ready to extend a truce beyond April 20, referencing a previous proposal for a 30-day ceasefire.</p>

            <p>Superman's enduring appeal lies not only in his role as a beacon of hope but also in his relatability across diverse backgrounds. Gene Luen Yang, who wrote "Superman Smashes the Klan", draws parallels between his experience as a Chinese-American and Superman's dual identity. The article delves into Superman's Jewish roots and how the character's narrative resonates with themes of self-sacrifice and doing good without seeking recognition. Despite the religious undertones, Superman's universal appeal transcends religious boundaries, encapsulating American civil religion and a pragmatic philosophical approach.</p>

Legal experts warn that the agreement between the US and El Salvador could normalize institutional violence and undermine democratic principles. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported, has sparked further criticism and highlighted the disregard for judicial orders.</p>
