          <p>Former President Donald Trump stated his dissatisfaction with Vladimir Putin's recent military actions in Ukraine, citing the loss of life and continued attacks on cities despite ongoing negotiations. Trump mentioned that he has always maintained a positive relationship with Putin but is troubled by the current situation and is considering implementing additional sanctions in response to the escalating violence. He expressed surprise at the attacks, especially given the ongoing discussions between the two countries. This marks a shift in Trump's rhetoric, as he has previously been seen as sympathetic to Russia's position in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has agreed to extend trade negotiations with the European Union until July 9, averting a potential trade war after threatening to impose 50% tariffs on all EU imports. The decision followed a discussion with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who requested additional time to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Trump had previously expressed frustration with the slow pace of negotiations, but von der Leyen's assurance of swift progress led to the extension. The EU has also expressed a commitment to securing a deal that works for both sides, guided by mutual respect.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized President Vladimir Putin's escalation of attacks in Ukraine and stated he is considering imposing more sanctions on Russia. Trump expressed his unhappiness with Putin's actions, citing the killing of people and the ongoing attacks despite negotiations for a cease-fire. He mentioned being surprised by the escalation and emphasized that the attacks are happening while the two countries are in the midst of discussions. This marks a notable shift in Trump's stance, as he has previously been perceived as sympathetic towards Russia.</p>
