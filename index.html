          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank would have likely lowered interest rates by now if not for the Trump administration's tariff policies. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell explained that the announcement of widespread tariffs forced the Fed to revise its inflation forecasts upward, effectively putting its plans for monetary easing on hold. The Fed has maintained its key borrowing rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December, despite pressure from the White House to implement cuts. Powell indicated that future decisions will be data-dependent and made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. (not investment advice)</p>

The facility, located at a remote airport, is intended to house up to 5,000 people as part of an expanded deportation effort. Administration officials have highlighted the isolated and dangerous location, surrounded by alligators and pythons, as a feature to deter escapes and house what they describe as "criminal illegal aliens."

          <p>Senate Republicans are struggling to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's extensive tax and spending bill, with four GOP senators currently opposing the legislation. With a slim majority, leadership can only afford three defections and is actively negotiating to win over at least one of the dissenters. The bill, which extends Trump's first-term tax cuts and reduces spending on social programs, must pass the Senate before returning to the House for another difficult vote. While President Trump had set a July 4th deadline, he has since conceded that meeting it would be very challenging.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering large amounts of inventory to avoid duties, a practice known as front-loading. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial costs or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments, waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers and expect prices to rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies become unsustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

He is accused of one count of sexual assault and 36 counts of indecent assault against 13 women, with one victim alleging he sexually assaulted her at his home.

          <p>To determine a company's true values beyond corporate platitudes, NYU professor and author Suzy Welch recommends a specific question for job interviews. Instead of asking about a company's values directly, she suggests asking, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" Welch argues this question often catches managers off guard and elicits more honest and revealing answers about the actual work environment and expectations. She advises asking this question late in the interview process, after an offer has been made, to gauge whether the company's real culture is a good fit for the candidate.</p>

The report found that the bottom 20% of households would see their annual income decrease by an average of 2.9% ($700), largely due to sharp cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Conversely, the top 20% of earners would see an average income increase of 2.2% ($5,700) from the bill's tax cut extensions. These findings align with other analyses suggesting the legislation's net effect would be regressive. (not investment advice)</p>

The case against Letby herself remains controversial, with experts and her lawyer challenging the medical evidence used for her conviction and seeking a formal review.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to clarify how it plans to implement the executive order targeting birthright citizenship. The order came after the Supreme Court partially lifted nationwide injunctions against the policy, which seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. During a hearing, Judge Deborah Boardman pressed the Department of Justice on whether it would begin deporting babies affected by the order who are not currently plaintiffs in the case. The DOJ stated that guidelines are still being developed, and the judge has requested a written statement by Tuesday detailing the government's enforcement plans.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the investigation into the November 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. It traces the case from the discovery of the victimsâ€”Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalvesâ€”to the recent announcement of a plea deal. Key events detailed include the initial police press conferences, the search for a white Hyundai Elantra, and the eventual arrest of Ph.D. student Bryan Kohberger in Pennsylvania. The timeline concludes with Kohberger's agreement to plead guilty in exchange for life in prison, a development that spares him from the death penalty.</p>

          <p>An analysis of recent comments by Vice President JD Vance suggests the Republican party's primary focus for its massive budget bill is immigration enforcement. In a social media post, Vance stated that funding for ICE and other enforcement measures is the most critical part of the legislation, describing all other elementsâ€”such as the bill's impact on the national debt or Medicaidâ€”as "immaterial." This rhetoric frames the bill's controversial aspects, like cuts to social programs and increased debt, as secondary to the goal of cracking down on immigration, a message aimed at the party's base.</p>

          <p>North Korea is preparing to send thousands more military personnel to Russia to aid in the war against Ukraine, a move that benefits both regimes. For Russia, the influx of North Korean troops, including military engineers, helps offset its significant troop losses without requiring a broader mobilization of its own citizens, which could be politically risky. In return, North Korea receives vital supplies like fuel and food, as well as access to advanced military technology, helping it bypass international sanctions.

Trump suggested on social media that he might use the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a cost-cutting agency Musk once helped lead, to investigate and cut subsidies for Musk's companies. Musk has been a vocal critic of the budget bill, arguing it increases the national debt and undermines his previous work to cut government spending. The feud highlights a growing rift between the former allies, with Musk even threatening to support primary challengers against Republicans who vote for the bill.</p>

According to tax records, the payment came from a non-profit group called American Resolve Policy Fund for fundraising assistance. This same "dark money" group later funded social media ads attacking news outlets that had reported on Noem's alleged misuse of taxpayer funds as governor. While not necessarily illegal, the arrangement has raised ethical questions, with one Republican lawmaker stating that a governor should not have a private side business unknown to the public.</p>

          <p>As the jury deliberates in Sean Combs' federal trial, the verdict hinges on a central narrative conflict: whether his sexual encounters were the result of coercion or consent. The prosecution portrayed Combs as a violent and controlling figure who used his power and resources to force his partners into illegal sex acts, presenting evidence of an enterprise involving his employees. In contrast, the defense argued that while Combs' lifestyle was unconventional and his relationships were toxic, the sexual encounters were consensual and did not constitute federal crimes.

          <p>The e-commerce sector is facing its most significant disruption in over a decade, largely due to the impact of President Trump's tariffs, according to a new survey. The data reveals double-digit declines in online purchases for home delivery across major categories like electronics and furniture. The survey indicates that tariffs are directly influencing consumer behavior, with 34% of respondents delaying purchases due to price uncertainty and 66% stating they would seek domestic alternatives if prices on foreign goods rise. Retailers are also tightening shipping and return policies to offset rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Planned Parenthood is facing an existential threat from the combined actions of the Trump administration and the Supreme Court. The administration has repeatedly cut the organization's funding and excluded it from federal programs, while a recent Supreme Court ruling now allows states to ban Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs. The author contends this will force the closure of hundreds of clinics, effectively creating a de facto ban on care from pro-choice providers for millions of low-income women.

          <p>The CEO of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, announced that the retailer's online shopping services should be fully operational within four weeks following a major cyber-attack. The attack in April locked up M&S systems, disrupting sales and stealing some customer data, with an estimated profit impact of Â£300 million. While online orders have resumed in most of the UK, services like click-and-collect are still down, and the retailer is focused on getting its main distribution center fully functional again. The company hopes to have the vast majority of the issues resolved by August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling a portion of its shares in Broadcom following a significant rally in the stock's price. The semiconductor and software company's stock has risen nearly 90% since its April lows, prompting the move to book an approximate 220% gain on the shares being sold. The decision is also framed as a disciplined measure to raise cash while the market is considered overbought, though the club remains bullish on Broadcom's long-term potential in artificial intelligence.

          <p>Official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 14.2% increase in the number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales in 2024 compared to the previous year. Out of nearly 600,000 live births, 1,076 had fathers in this age group. The data also reflects a continuing trend of people waiting longer to have children, with a decrease in births to mothers under 30. Overall, the total number of births in England saw a slight increase for the first time since 2021, bucking a recent trend of decline.</p>

Ukrainian defense firms are mounting the reliable and widely available .50 caliber weapon on autonomous vehicles designed to attack Russian positions. This adaptation allows Ukraine to leverage existing Western weapon supplies for its emerging robotic warfare systems, which can perform tasks from surveillance to direct firefights. The use of the M2 highlights the blend of old and new technology on the Ukrainian battlefield, combining a proven, historic weapon with cutting-edge artificial intelligence.</p>

          <h2>Health Report Identifies Common Medications That Can Impair Body's Ability to Cope with Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:50:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five common types of prescription medications that can interfere with the body's natural ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of heat-related illness. Drugs such as certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, beta-blockers, diuretics, and stimulants can affect processes like sweating, blood flow, and thirst response. For example, some heart medications limit blood flow to the skin, making it harder to release heat, while diuretics can lead to dehydration. The report advises patients on these medications to stay hydrated, avoid peak heat, and consult their doctor if they have concerns, but not to stop taking their prescriptions.</p>
