          <p>Germany is facing several domestic challenges, including a new record high for domestic violence, with over 256,000 victims reported in 2024. This represents a significant increase over the last five years, with women comprising the vast majority of victims. In separate news, a key railway line between Düsseldorf and Duisburg reopened after suspected arson by left-wing extremists caused major disruptions. Additionally, a German consumer group is suing several budget airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, arguing that their fees for standard hand luggage are illegal and violate a 2014 European court ruling.</p>

Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong urged local authorities in the manufacturing hub to enhance prevention measures, eliminate mosquitoes, and implement strict port quarantines to stop the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. As of late July, Guangdong province had reported over 4,800 cases, with nearly 60% concentrated in Foshan, a city of 10 million people. While there have been no fatalities, the scale of the outbreak has prompted significant public health responses.</p>

          <p>A growing number of professionals are opting to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen while commuting to their jobs in Hong Kong, a trend driven by the desire for more affordable and spacious living arrangements. These commuters endure lengthy daily journeys, often over 90 minutes each way, involving multiple modes of transport and a border crossing. The phenomenon is gaining traction on social media, where individuals share tips on navigating the cross-border lifestyle. This trade-off between a long commute and lower living costs highlights the significant expense of renting property in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has expressed that the transfer situation involving star striker Alexander Isak is "far from ideal" and complex. The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish international, whom they value at approximately £150 million. Isak, who was the team's top scorer last season, is currently training alone at his former club in Spain, a development Howe learned about through the media. The manager stated his wish is for Isak to remain with Newcastle, but acknowledged he is removed from the ongoing negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just hours after the agency released disappointing jobs data. Trump accused the agency of rigging figures to make him look bad, a claim he made without evidence. The move, which critics have called authoritarian, sent US stock markets plunging and drew condemnation for politicizing vital economic data. The dismissal followed the release of a report showing only 73,000 jobs were added in July, far below forecasts, which many economists attribute to the uncertainty caused by Trump's own tariff policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest round of import tariffs has triggered negative reactions across the global economy, with US, European, and Asian stock markets experiencing significant declines. The new duties target numerous countries, including key allies like Canada, India, and Switzerland, with some facing rates as high as 39%. Various nations are now scrambling to negotiate exemptions before the August 7 implementation date. The French wine industry warned of a "brutal" impact, while other nations like South Africa and India expressed hope for a last-minute resolution to protect their economies and jobs.

By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that about nine million years ago, a forerunner of the modern tomato hybridized with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This event was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the edible part that has made the potato a staple food crop worldwide.

          <p>Two men from Los Angeles County have been charged with murder for their role in running an illegal cannabis extraction operation where five workers died in two separate incidents. Prosecutors allege that Ted Chien and Han Quan Jiao operated a network of labs, including one in Irwindale where an explosion killed four workers in 2023, and another in South El Monte where a fire killed a fifth employee. The men are accused of gross negligence and putting profit over safety. If convicted, Chien could face the death penalty, while Jiao could receive a life sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Motorists on a busy Pennsylvania highway experienced a unique traffic delay when a truck carrying hot dogs had an accident, spilling its entire cargo across the road. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to scrape against a concrete divider, which ripped it open and scattered the sausages over the roadway. The incident occurred during the morning commute in Shrewsbury, creating a slippery and unusual cleanup challenge for fire crews. A front-end loader was eventually brought in to scoop the discarded wieners into a dump truck, clearing the way for traffic to resume.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled arguments for a major case next term that will examine the constitutionality of racial redistricting. The case centers on Louisiana's newly created second majority-Black congressional district, which a lower court had invalidated as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The high court has asked parties to submit briefs on whether creating the district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. The eventual ruling could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and the balance of power in the House of Representatives for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>
