          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who prosecuted cases against Donald Trump. The probe centers on potential violations of the Hatch Act, a law limiting the political activities of federal employees, following a referral from Senator Tom Cotton. Cotton alleged that Smith's push for a rushed trial before the election constituted illegal political interference. The cases against Trump were closed after his reelection, and Smith resigned from his position in January.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the "Son of Sam" attacks through the experiences of two survivors, Robert Violante and Carl Denaro. Violante was shot on his first date, losing his sight but surviving, while his date Stacy Moskowitz tragically died. Denaro was also shot and seriously injured, with a metal plate placed in his head. Both men reflect on how the attacks by David Berkowitz in the late 1970s irrevocably changed their lives. They express relief that Berkowitz remains incarcerated, preventing him from harming anyone else.</p>

          <p>An Ottawa County Sheriff's new patrol boat, which had its maiden voyage just two months ago, sank at a marina in Port Clinton, Ohio, during a severe storm. Officials believe a seiche, a rapid rise in water level caused by strong winds, may have compromised the boat's dive doors and dragged it under. The $360,000 vessel, funded by a Homeland Security grant, was quickly recovered but sustained significant damage to its electronics and interior. The sheriff's office is investigating the exact cause and is confident the boat will eventually return to service on Lake Erie.</p>

          <h2>Prosecutors Theorize Bryan Kohberger May Have Used a Second Weapon and Fled in Panic</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the case against Bryan Kohberger for the University of Idaho murders, prosecutor Bill Thompson has suggested a second weapon might have been used. This theory stems from injuries on victim Kaylee Goncalves that appeared inconsistent with the primary knife. Thompson also speculated that Kohberger spared a surviving roommate because he panicked after being in the house longer than planned and feared law enforcement had been called. The prosecutor emphasized the critical role of DNA evidence found on a knife sheath in identifying and building the case against Kohberger.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant protesters and counter-demonstrators outside hotels housing asylum seekers. Protests occurred in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police imposing special restrictions to keep the opposing groups separated. The events highlight ongoing tensions surrounding the UK's asylum system, which the government aims to reform by fast-tracking appeals and reducing the use of hotels for housing. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated a goal of restoring "order and control" to the system amid these demonstrations.</p>

          <p>The average monthly cost for a nursing home in Germany has surged to €3,248, a sum that is crippling for many retirees whose average pension is around €1,100.

With an aging population, the system is under immense strain, and nearly one in three residents now relies on welfare to cover costs. German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system to address the growing financial crisis facing seniors.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the new Labour MP for Stourbridge, is under investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner for failing to declare a sponsored trip within the required timeframe. The investigation centers on a visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, valued at £2,600 and sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel, which took place in late May. According to parliamentary rules, such interests must be registered within 28 days, but the trip was not filed until early July. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the delay to an administrative error rather than an attempt to conceal the visit.</p>

          <p>The Tea app, which allows women to anonymously share information about men in their dating pools, has experienced a major data breach, exposing users' personal data online. Hackers accessed and leaked sensitive information, including driver's licenses and direct messages, which was then circulated on the message board 4chan. The app, which markets itself as a safe space, now faces class-action lawsuits. The incident highlights the inherent risks of digital "whisper networks," where the potential for protecting women can be compromised by cybersecurity failures and the potential for misuse.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of young adults are turning to TikTok for news, relying on "newsfluencers" and algorithm-driven content rather than traditional media outlets. According to a Pew poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, consuming information through rapid-fire summaries, skits, and memes. While creators like Aaron Parnas aim for fact-based reporting, the platform's nature raises concerns about misinformation and a lack of depth. The trend highlights a major shift in media consumption, where convenience and entertainment value often take precedence over comprehensive, traditional journalism.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the administration cannot use a presidential proclamation to unilaterally ignore laws that protect migrants from being deported to countries where they face torture or persecution. While the court allowed the ban on discretionary asylum applications to continue, it affirmed that mandatory protections must still be granted to those who qualify. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging the legality of the border closure order issued by President Trump upon his return to office.</p>

          <p>A Ninth Circuit appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The court agreed that such sweeps, which were a hallmark of the Trump administration's enforcement strategy, likely violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The ruling requires agents to have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before detaining them. The decision was praised by immigrant advocates as a crucial protection for the region's diverse communities.</p>

The investigation found at least 52 instances where individuals said their names were forged, including three who are deceased, or claimed they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to gather them.

          <p>U.S. markets experienced a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high before a four-day losing streak. The volatility was fueled by several major events, including the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady and a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which saw only 73,000 positions added. President Trump reacted by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and imposing new "reciprocal" tariffs on trade partners like Canada. The confluence of weak economic data and political actions left investors guessing and pushed major indices to a weekly loss. (not investment advice)</p>
