          <p>Former President Barack Obama delivered a speech at Hamilton College, imploring Americans to actively defend democratic values in response to what he views as threats posed by Donald Trump's agenda. Obama criticized Trump's economic policies, specifically tariffs, but expressed greater concern over federal actions that undermine academic freedom and free speech on university campuses. He challenged universities and law firms to resist intimidation and uphold their values, even if it means sacrificing government funding or facing political repercussions. Obama's remarks emphasized the need for citizens to take a stand and protect the principles of democracy in a changing political landscape.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic raises serious questions about President Trump's continued interest in acquiring Greenland, a territory of Denmark, suggesting his ambitions may violate international and American law. The author argues that Trump's pursuit of Greenland goes beyond mere jest and has progressed into actionable policy, as evidenced by White House meetings and dispatched emissaries. The article contends that any attempt to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government would constitute an act of aggression against a NATO ally and potentially trigger a civil-military crisis in the United States. It calls upon senior military commanders to refuse any illegal orders to seize Greenland.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley is experiencing significant market repercussions following President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, with the Nasdaq experiencing its worst week since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tech giants have lost substantial market capitalization, and IPOs are being delayed due to market instability. While some venture capitalists defend Trump's policies, economists warn of a potential recession. Tech executives remain largely silent, but the market turmoil is causing concern among employees, and economists are concerned about potential recession.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new hacking technique called "doubleclickjacking" is turning double-clicks into account takeovers, posing a significant threat to online security. This method allows hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command when a user double-clicks on a website, potentially granting access to sensitive information or device settings. Traditional security measures often fail against doubleclickjacking, as they primarily protect against single clicks. The article advises caution when double-clicking on unfamiliar websites, keeping browsers updated, using strong antivirus software, and limiting unnecessary permissions to mitigate the risk of falling victim to this type of attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political scientists Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argues that liberals were wrong about the pandemic and that aggressive Covid-19 policies, such as lockdowns and mask mandates, were not always grounded in science and lacked rigorous public debate. The authors suggest that public health authorities and progressive elites often pushed measures without considering their costs and benefits, and ostracized dissenting voices. They point to data showing no significant difference in Covid mortality rates between Democratic and Republican states, despite differing policies. The book also highlights the economic and social costs of shutdowns, including learning loss, inflation, and increased crime rates.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted a large-scale missile defense test in the Gobi Desert, firing as many as 16 ballistic missiles on a single target.

According to a paper published by a senior PLA engineer, the radar system successfully detected and tracked all missiles, achieving a 100% success rate in hitting the target. This test marks the first public disclosure of China's land-based early warning radar capabilities and signals its growing confidence in countering advanced threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A "dead" investor, referring to an inactive trader with a "buy and hold" strategy, often outperforms living, active investors. Experts suggest that human behavior, particularly emotional decision-making during market fluctuations, poses the biggest threat to investor returns. Data indicates that the average stock investor's return lags behind the S&P 500 due to buying high and selling low. While investors shouldn't do nothing, basic steps like reviewing asset allocation and rebalancing are recommended over impulsive trading decisions.

          <p>President Trump's tariff announcement has led to significant economic and market turmoil, with stocks experiencing a sharp sell-off. China retaliated with tariffs, and the EU is considering countermeasures, creating an antagonistic global trade environment. Economists criticize the rudimentary math behind the tariffs, and investors are selling risky assets due to uncertainty about future earnings. The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates further dampened market sentiment, leading to substantial losses in market value.

          <p>Theodore McCarrick, a former Catholic cardinal who was defrocked in 2019 after being found guilty of molesting adults and children, has died at the age of 94. The McCarrick scandal created a crisis of credibility for the Catholic Church, as there was evidence that Vatican and U.S. church leaders were aware of his misconduct but failed to take action. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) expressed frustration that McCarrick never faced trial for his crimes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump remains defiant about his tariffs, saying this is "an economic revolution." In a new social media post, Trump appeared to acknowledge that American consumers will feel pain in the interim and tells them that in the long run it'll be worth it. He also jabbed China, reiterating that other countries have treated the United States "unsustainably badly." The baseline tariffs went into effect this morning at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday, April 5.</p>

          <p>President Trump hopes his tariffs will boost manufacturing in the U.S., but experts say it's not so simple. While tariffs could help, a strong dollar and workforce development are also key. Businesses are proceeding cautiously due to tariff uncertainty and the long lead times for building industrial capacity. Research suggests previous tariffs had limited impact on reshoring. Experts say the U.S. needs infrastructure, workers, and a willingness to work in factories to truly reshore.

          <p>The world's richest individuals, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk, have experienced significant losses in net worth due to the market downturn triggered by President Trump's tariff announcement. Tech stocks, in particular, are being hit hard due to their reliance on manufacturing and IT services from countries affected by the tariffs. Musk, who is working with Trump on government efficiency, has seen his fortune decline substantially this year, though not all billionaires lost money during the market rout.

          <p>Tesla's June robotaxi deadline approaches amidst rising political opposition against Elon Musk. Musk has promised investors for a decade that Tesla cars will become robotaxis, but the technology has yet to fully materialize. Tesla's Full Self-Driving system, while advanced, is only partially automated and requires constant driver attention. Musk's association with President Trump and his political rhetoric have led to a backlash against Tesla, affecting sales and stock prices. The company is under pressure to deliver on its robotaxi promises to revitalize investor sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led Senate has approved a revised budget plan, bringing Congress closer to finalizing a multi-trillion dollar agenda focused on defense, energy, immigration, and tax policy. The plan extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and includes additional funds for border enforcement and defense. However, it faces challenges in the House due to disagreements over spending cuts and how to pay for the tax cuts. The Senate plan also addresses the debt limit, aiming to avoid a financial default.</p>

          <p>A study in Wales suggests that older adults who received a shingles vaccine were 20% less likely to develop dementia over seven years. This finding raises the possibility that a known, inexpensive vaccine could offer real protection against dementia. The study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by a virus, which could change the approach to preventing and treating these conditions. Researchers theorize that the vaccine reduces inflammation around nerve cells, which is linked to cognitive deterioration.</p>
