            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) reporters from accessing the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other secure spaces where journalists from other media outlets are admitted. The ruling stated that blocking AP journalists is contrary to the First Amendment, after the White House curtailed the wire service's access in mid-February. The curtailment happened after the AP did not reflect the change in its references to the Gulf of Mexico after President Trump renamed it the "Gulf of America". The judge's order is stayed until Sunday to allow the White House time to appeal.</p>

Tanzi confessed to beating, robbing, and strangling Acosta before leaving her body on an island in the Florida Keys. The US Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal from Tanzi's attorneys. This marks the third execution in Florida this year, with another scheduled for May 1. The execution was carried out using a three-drug cocktail for lethal injection.</p>

            <p>A Republican lawmaker in Colorado is raising concerns that the state's Democratic legislature may face consequences from the Trump administration due to recently passed bills. These bills include measures expanding healthcare access for illegal immigrants, mandating insurance coverage for transgender procedures regardless of age, and prohibiting cooperation with out-of-state investigations on transgender procedures and abortion services. State Rep. Jarvis Caldwell warns that Colorado could risk losing federal funding for programs like Medicaid and education, as these policies potentially violate orders from President Trump, particularly concerning gender ideology and immigration. The bills have sparked controversy, with Republicans criticizing the limited debate time and the inclusion of provisions they view as harmful, such as gender-affirming surgeries for minors.</p>

            <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has finalized an agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to share tax information about some immigrants without legal status. Under the agreement, ICE officers can request information about immigrants who have final orders of removal or are under criminal investigation. Immigrant advocates express concerns that this decision threatens the safety of workers, forces them further into the shadows, and discourages tax compliance, despite assurances of confidentiality from the IRS in the past. The Treasury Department maintains that the agreement is founded in longstanding authorities granted by Congress to protect privacy while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals.</p>

            <p>President Trump's administration is reportedly planning to cut a $500 million grant from the Biden administration slated for Cleveland-Cliffs, a steel manufacturing giant in Middletown, Ohio, the hometown of Vice-President JD Vance. The grant was intended to help the company upgrade its blast furnaces to be powered by hydrogen, natural gas, and electricity instead of coal. Critics argue that this move contradicts Trump's promises to bolster the US manufacturing industry. The decision has sparked concern among residents and unions who were anticipating new jobs and a more climate-friendly agenda.</p>

The research aims to provide insights into how nutrition, sleep, and maternal care can help, while also highlighting the stark realities of poverty's impact on brain development. Professor James Boardman's team is examining how premature birth affects brain development, with key findings showing the impact of poverty.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claims the measles outbreak in western Texas is slowing down, citing data since early March. However, data from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates cases are increasing, with more counties reporting infections. Public health officials project a year-long timeline for control of the outbreak and believe cases are likely much higher than official counts. Kennedy also promoted treatments not intended for all measles cases, including aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin, which experts say are not standard treatments for measles.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, adding to a three-day sell-off that has wiped out trillions in market value. The sell-off is attributed to anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs. Economists suggest the tariffs are likely to drive up inflation, potentially stalling U.S. economic growth and increasing the risk of a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

The analyst, Laura Martin, states that such a move is unlikely and would significantly increase Apple's costs, with one analyst estimating the cost of an iPhone produced in the U.S. at $3,500. Martin also notes that moving Apple's supply chain to the U.S. would take years, and most experts believe it is impossible to make iPhones completely in the U.S. The comments come as Apple shares decline due to its manufacturing exposure to China and the new tariff rates.</p>

Critics argue that coal is not "clean" energy due to its greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.

Unlike the pandemic, where the Federal Reserve quickly slashed interest rates, the Fed is not expected to immediately intervene due to concerns about rising inflation alongside slowing growth.

            <p>President Trump signed four executive actions aimed at reversing policies that transitioned the country away from coal production, intending to boost the U.S.'s "beautiful clean coal industry." The actions include defining coal as a "mineral" to give it more leeway on its use, lifting barriers to coal mining on federal lands, and directing agencies to rescind policies transitioning away from coal. Trump emphasized coal's importance for affordable and reliable energy, using the Defense Production Act to "turbocharge" coal mining. Environmental groups criticized the move, suggesting it is a step backward and will lead to more pollution and health issues.</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares continue to decline, CEO Elon Musk has intensified his attacks on President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Musk criticized Navarro's comments about Tesla being a "car assembler" and questioned his economic expertise. The public spat highlights the division within the Trump administration regarding tariffs. Tesla's stock has declined significantly, attributed to the tariffs on materials and parts from foreign suppliers, impacting the company's production costs. Musk has previously advocated for a zero-tariff situation between Europe and North America.</p>

            <p>Economist Oren Cass argues that tariffs are necessary to rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector, which he believes is essential for the economy. He contends that making things matters and that economists have wrongly dismissed the importance of domestic production. Cass supports President Trump's tariffs, stating that they will encourage domestic production and balance trade. He believes that Americans are willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. to support a stronger industrial base and improve social stability.</p>

            <p>Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Trump and House Republicans to garner support for the Senate-approved budget bill. GOP leaders are relying on Trump to help pass the bill, which is crucial for funding Trump's agenda, before the House takes a two-week recess. Johnson expressed confidence that Trump is persuading Republicans to support the budget blueprint, offering commitments and assurances. However, some Republicans remain opposed, arguing that the plan does not adequately reduce the deficit.</p>

The labor-intensive garment factories in Cambodia cannot continue to operate with a 49% additional tariff. Companies are pausing orders and exploring alternative locations for their supply chains, such as Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

Coal stocks rose following the president's order, despite the ongoing decline of coal plants due to competition from natural gas and environmental concerns.</p>
