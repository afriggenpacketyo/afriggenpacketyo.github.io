          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed President Donald Trump's significant spending bill following an overnight session where Republican leaders worked to secure the necessary votes. The legislation, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term while cutting social programs, faced resistance from some party members until the president personally intervened. Democrats have strongly opposed the bill, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and could lead to millions losing health insurance. The bill, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over a decade, now heads to the president's desk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Maryland man has been arrested and charged with a felony for allegedly trying to bring a 'ghost gun' into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. The firearm, which lacked a serial number and was fully functional, was detected in the man's bag during a routine security screening. The individual claimed he had forgotten the weapon was in his bag and is not licensed to carry a firearm in Washington, D.C. This incident is part of a rising trend, with over 20 arrests for unlawful firearms possession on Capitol Hill this year.</p>

          <p>An American novelist, Eleonor "Gay" Courter, and her husband are facing potential charges in France for their alleged role in selling gold bars plundered from a French shipwreck that sank in 1746. French prosecutors claim the couple helped a diver illegally sell bullion from the wreck of Le Prince de Conty. The investigation began after suspicious online sales were traced back to the couple, who deny any knowledge of wrongdoing. Investigators believe the diver retrieved 16 gold bars over several decades, with the Courters allegedly selling at least 18 ingots for over $192,000.</p>

          <p>The U.S. retail industry is reacting with mixed feelings to President Trump's announcement of a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a significant reduction from the initially proposed 46%. While executives are relieved to have avoided the worst-case scenario, many still believe the new rate will negatively impact businesses and lead to higher prices for consumers. Vietnam has become a critical manufacturing hub for apparel and footwear companies moving their supply chains out of China. Companies are now strategizing how to absorb the increased costs, with price hikes on consumer goods being a likely outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retail theft in Germany has surged, with a 2024 survey estimating that losses have reached nearly €5 billion, a 3% increase from the previous year. The study by Germany's Retail Institute (EHI) indicates that theft by customers, employees, and delivery workers is the primary cause of these inventory discrepancies. Organized shoplifting is also on the rise, accounting for a third of the total losses from theft. Criminologists suggest these are often "poverty crimes," committed by those with no money, though retailers also point to opportunistic theft and protest against rising prices as contributing factors.</p>

However, several GOP representatives stated they were focused on passing the president's agenda and were not concerned by Musk's warnings. They defended the legislation, highlighting its spending cuts and alignment with promises made to their constituents, asserting their unity with the president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was significantly powered by hiring in the public sector, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. State and local governments added 73,000 jobs, accounting for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month, with most new positions in education. This robust government hiring helped the overall job numbers exceed expectations. In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink its workforce, shedding 7,000 jobs, consistent with the Trump administration's focus on reducing the size of the federal bureaucracy.

While current calculations show a high-yield savings account earning slightly more over 18-month to three-year terms, this assumes static interest rates. The article notes that CDs offer a fixed rate, providing protection against anticipated future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

          <p>President Trump's major legislative package, nearing final approval, contains several significant tax changes that are expected to primarily benefit wealthy Americans. The bill makes many of the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces new breaks, such as raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for certain incomes. It also enhances benefits for investors in small businesses by increasing the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption and makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent. These changes are projected to increase the after-tax income of millionaire earners by an average of 3%. (not investment advice)</p>

It also increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, terminates many clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

This pattern of viewing younger generations as a subject of study, often with condescension, has persisted through various eras. The challenge for writers is to document generational shifts with humility and nuance, avoiding stereotypes and recognizing young people as individuals navigating the unique circumstances of their time.</p>

This included tracking Kohberger's car and phone near the crime scene and, crucially, matching DNA from a knife sheath left at the scene to his father's DNA obtained from a Q-tip in the family's trash. The summary detailed how Kohberger killed the four students but did not establish a motive or a prior connection to the victims.

This decision sets the stage for a landmark ruling with nationwide implications, as two dozen other states have enacted similar laws. The case follows a recent Supreme Court decision that upheld a ban on gender-transition care for minors, a ruling seen as a significant setback for transgender rights.</p>

          <p>Brazilian teenage star Estêvão Willian is set to play for his current club, Palmeiras, against Chelsea in the Club World Cup quarter-finals before he officially joins the English team. The 18-year-old, who agreed to a deal that could be worth up to £52m, has admitted feeling anxious as his departure approaches. The match is seen as a crucial test for Estêvão, who has yet to deliver a defining performance in a major game for Palmeiras. While Chelsea are considered the favorites, the match represents a significant moment for the young talent to prove himself on a global stage.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful explosions at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven people unaccounted for, according to officials. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics caused a large fire that spread to nearby grasslands and prompted mandatory evacuations in the rural Yolo County area. Two people were confirmed to have been injured, and family members have gathered nearby, anxiously awaiting news of loved ones believed to have been working inside. The business has an active license for importing and exporting commercial fireworks, and Cal Fire is leading the investigation into the cause.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a case concerning a Montana law that would have required minors to obtain notarized parental consent for an abortion. By refusing to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves in place the Montana Supreme Court's decision, which struck down the law on the grounds that it violated the state constitution's right to privacy. Conservative Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch agreed with the decision not to hear this specific case but indicated they are open to addressing the constitutional rights of parents in a future, more suitable case.</p>

          <p>Shares of online travel company Tripadvisor surged 17% after activist investment firm Starboard Value revealed it has acquired a significant stake of over 9%. Starboard is known for taking positions in companies and pushing for strategic changes, such as new leadership or cost-cutting measures, to boost shareholder value. Tripadvisor's stock had been underperforming, and the company had previously formed a special committee to explore potential strategic options. This move by a prominent activist investor has sparked speculation about potential changes ahead for the travel review and booking platform. (not investment advice)</p>
