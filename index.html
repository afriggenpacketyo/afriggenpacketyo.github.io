          <p>Authorities are continuing the search for Grant Hardin, the former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," who escaped from an Arkansas prison. The Arkansas Department of Corrections released an updated image of Hardin, showing how he might look with facial hair and a slimmer appearance after being on the run for over a week. The search is focused on north central Arkansas, and investigators are using tips from the public to guide their efforts. A reward for information leading to Hardin's capture has increased to $25,000, and the corrections department is investigating how he obtained or manufactured a correctional officer uniform to aid in his escape. The updated image aims to assist the public in identifying Hardin as the manhunt intensifies. Optimism is low given the nature of the situation and the ongoing search. </p>

          <p>A commencement speech delivered at Harvard University by Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, the first Chinese woman chosen as Harvard‚Äôs student commencement speaker, has ignited debate in China regarding access to elite education. Jiang's speech called for global unity, however, some Chinese internet users have raised questions about the lack of access for many ordinary students who struggle to be considered for prestigious universities, citing an uneven distribution of financial and educational resources. Critics have also questioned her privileged background, including her education in the UK and her father's role in a foundation that provided her with a recommendation letter. The debate centers on whether merit or privilege plays a larger role in accessing elite educational opportunities in China. The discourse surrounding access to higher education is complex. </p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers have revealed the development of an artificial intelligence system designed to enhance the accuracy of high-speed torpedoes in submarine warfare. The system, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, is designed to distinguish real submarines from decoys with unprecedented accuracy. Tested against data from classified high-speed torpedo ranges, the technology achieved an average 92.2 percent success rate, marking a significant improvement over legacy systems. This development aims to counter underwater deception tactics, potentially enhancing China's naval capabilities.

          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a decline in extended trading following the release of a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast, despite the company surpassing earnings expectations. For the fiscal first quarter, CrowdStrike reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents on revenue of $1.10 billion, in line with revenue expectations. The company's costs increased due to higher sales and marketing expenses, as well as increased research and development and administrative costs, partly due to a broad software outage from the previous summer. CrowdStrike has earmarked $1 billion for share buybacks and anticipates a free cash flow margin above 30% for the 2027 fiscal year. (not investment advice) </p>

The bill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, is projected to add trillions to the national debt, raising concerns among senators like Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, and Rand Paul. Elon Musk criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination," further complicating Trump's efforts to gain support. Some Republicans also worry about the bill's impact on Medicaid, while others are concerned about the rollback of green energy funding.

          <p>The Israeli military (IDF) has declared roads leading to aid distribution centers in Gaza as "combat zones," prompting the closure of these sites for a day. This decision follows a deadly incident where at least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire near a distribution center, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US and Israel-backed aid network, has temporarily closed its sites for "efficiency improvements." Humanitarian organizations continue to warn about insufficient access to food and water for Palestinians in Gaza, and the GHF aims to replace the UN-led aid distribution network, which Israel accuses of failing to prevent supplies from being hijacked by Hamas. The safety and accessibility of aid distribution in Gaza remain critical concerns. </p>

During the confirmation hearing, Boren acknowledged some disagreements but stated that resolutions were reached after initial disputes. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing approximately 200 million acres of public land.

          <p>Middle and major powers are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology as tools of influence. Triangular diplomacy involves balancing and maneuvering between two other powers to build leverage and reduce dependency. This approach, reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik, is being adopted by leaders navigating a world where post-war institutions are declining and multilateral commitments are being reassessed. While offering agility and tactical scope, triangular diplomacy carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability.

The asset cap had prevented Wells Fargo from growing key lines of its business for years, and the removal now allows the firm to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. Under the proposal, the issuance of new work permits would be suspended until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeline difficult to meet given current backlogs. Even if the processing average is reached, asylum-seekers would be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit, instead of six months. Advocates argue that this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, potentially driving them to work illegally. The proposed rule is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten immigration policies. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with steep fines and legal action over policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports, following a transgender athlete's success in statewide high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has called California Interscholastic Foundation (CIF) policies "unconstitutional," alleging that they deprive female students of athletic opportunities. President Trump has singled out a specific athlete, stating that "large scale fines" will be imposed on the state. The Justice Department is investigating California high school sports, and the Trump administration has sued Maine over similar transgender athlete policies. The situation highlights the ongoing legal and political battles surrounding transgender rights. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is considering renaming multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders, including the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. The proposal to change the ship's name comes during Pride Month, with documents showing other vessels named after prominent leaders also under consideration for renaming. The memo said the renaming of naval ships was to realign the U.S. military with Trump administration priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture." The decision has sparked criticism, with some viewing it as a shameful erasure of those who fought for civil rights. The potential renaming reflects ongoing tensions between honoring civil rights legacies and prioritizing a specific military culture. </p>
