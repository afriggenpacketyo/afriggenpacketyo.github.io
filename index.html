          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and tripled cost estimates, with no track laid to date. The project, intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, is now reduced to a 171-mile stretch between Bakersfield and Merced by 2033. The article focuses on the eminent domain lawyer Mark Wasser, who represents landowners affected by the rail project, and argues that eminent domain is not the primary cause of the delays.

Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities can receive up to $30,000. Democrats argue that the legislation will harm public schools, as most of the students taking part in the program will be wealthier students who already attend private school.

          <p>Saúl Álvarez's recent fight with William Scull was criticized for being unentertaining, leading to questions about his upcoming bout with Terence Crawford. Experts suggest the Crawford fight, promoted by Turki Alalshikh and Dana White, may also be uneven due to Crawford moving up two weight divisions to challenge Álvarez. While Crawford is a highly skilled boxer, his lack of experience at super middleweight raises concerns about his ability to compete with Canelo's strength. Julio César Chávez predicts Canelo will knock out Crawford, citing the weight disparity.</p>

          <p>Fairhope, Alabama, is facing a culture war centered on its public library, with residents debating books containing sexual content or L.G.B.T.Q. themes. The state's library board paused funding to the library, demanding the relocation of certain books. The conflict has divided the city, with some residents supporting the move as safeguarding children, while others see it as censorship and a violation of Fairhope's history of independent thought. The library's board maintains it is in compliance with the state code and voted to keep the challenged book, “Sold,” in the teen section.</p>
