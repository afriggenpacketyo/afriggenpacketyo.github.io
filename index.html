          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Peter Welch and Tammy Baldwin, will hold hearings next week to examine the impact of widespread terminations at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The restructuring, which aims to reduce HHS employees by nearly 25%, has raised concerns about the functioning of key health programs like food and drug safety monitoring and pandemic preparedness. Welch criticized Kennedy's actions as a "destructive rampage" tearing apart institutional structures, while Kennedy defended the changes as necessary to eliminate redundancies and streamline the agency to make America healthy. GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy emphasized the need for reassurance that the reforms will improve lives.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock has turned positive for the year, joining Meta Platforms and Microsoft as the third "Magnificent Seven" member to achieve this milestone amid a broader market recovery. The surge followed CEO Jensen Huang's announcement of a significant AI chip sale to Saudi Arabia, potentially mitigating revenue headwinds from China restrictions. Analysts suggest this deal could offset billions in revenue losses tied to China's shipping constraints. While Nvidia's market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, the stock remains below its 52-week high from January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, alleging that the bank misled customers about its "360 Savings" account by failing to inform them of a new "360 Performance Savings" product with substantially higher interest rates. The suit claims that Capital One froze the interest rate of its 360 Savings product at 0.3% while increasing the rate of the 360 Performance Savings accounts to as high as 4.35%, causing New York customers to lose millions of dollars in interest. The lawsuit mirrors a similar case by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that was dropped earlier this year. Capital One disputes the claims and plans to defend itself in court.</p>

          <p>Alex Jacobsen, owner of Nashville-based Auratone, is contemplating moving his family's loudspeaker business overseas due to the financial strain caused by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs, which affect imported parts from China and Europe, have significantly increased the company's costs. Jacobsen fears that these tariffs, combined with retaliatory tariffs from other countries, could double the price of Auratone's speakers, making them uncompetitive. He is considering relocating manufacturing to Europe to benefit from free trade agreements, a move that underscores the potential unintended consequences of the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plans to lower prescription drug prices face uncertainty due to the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system and the influence of pharmaceutical companies. Americans pay significantly more for prescription drugs compared to other high-income countries, largely due to the lack of universal healthcare and limited negotiation power. While the executive order aims to address drug costs, similar efforts have faced legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices could hinder innovation. The article suggests that congressional action is needed for substantial change.</p>

          <p>With inflation declining and interest rate cuts on the horizon, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is emerging as an attractive borrowing option for homeowners.

As home equity levels remain elevated, homeowners can access substantial funds while maintaining a healthy equity buffer.

          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, debt consolidation is a viable option for borrowers seeking relief. Strategies include taking the initiative to consolidate debt now, shopping for lenders to find the best rates, and determining the right approach, whether independently or through a debt relief company. Borrowers should also consider alternatives like HELOCs and home equity loans, which may offer lower interest rates. By taking proactive steps, borrowers can regain financial freedom and reduce their debt burden.</p>

Critics argue that the policy is designed to fail, creating complex reporting demands that will cause eligible recipients to lose their health care.
