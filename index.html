          <h2>TikTok Shop Food Listings Pose Allergen Risks to Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 04:29:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation revealed that food sellers on TikTok Shop are failing to list allergen information, potentially endangering consumers with allergies. Listings were found selling snacks and sweets without declaring the 14 main allergens required by UK law. TikTok removed the highlighted listings, but sellers continue to offer products without full allergen details. Allergy charities emphasize the responsibility of both sellers and TikTok to ensure consumer safety and proper labeling, especially in light of Natasha's Law, which mandates full ingredient and allergen labeling for food made on premises. The lack of adequate measures on TikTok raises concerns about the safety of individuals with food allergies. </p>

          <p>Train services between Glasgow and London faced significant disruptions due to a fallen tree damaging overhead electric lines in southern Scotland. Avanti West Coast reported that all lines were blocked between Lockerbie and Carstairs, causing delays and cancellations.

Passengers were advised to use alternative east coast rail services or seek refunds.

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in Havering-atte-Bower, east London, have been kept indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground.

While intervention options are limited due to the buzzard being a protected species, the school has turned the situation into a learning experience. Pupils have named the bird Brenda and are creating art, stories, and newspaper articles about it, even receiving a visit from a bird of prey expert with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle.</p>

The report criticizes Trump and his movement for transforming the U.S. into an authoritarian regime and undermining international institutions.

          <p>Erin Patterson, on trial for the murder of three relatives after serving them a meal containing death cap mushrooms, testified that she has long enjoyed foraging for wild mushrooms due to their superior flavor. She detailed her experience picking field mushrooms and her experimentation with various wild fungi, preserving them using a food dehydrator. Patterson claimed the mushrooms used in the fatal meal were primarily purchased from a supermarket, with some possibly sourced from an Asian grocery store, and accidentally mixed with foraged ones. She also discussed her strained relationship with her estranged husband and his parents, expressing remorse for critical messages she sent about them.</p>

Pre-election polls suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public dissatisfaction with the conservatives after Yoon's martial law declaration. The winner will be immediately sworn in and face challenges including a slowing economy, trade tensions with the U.S., and North Korea's nuclear threats.

While talks with Sunderland have not yet commenced, Dortmund anticipates reaching an agreement, bolstered by their successful end to the season and Champions League qualification.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts that U.S. economic growth will decelerate to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% the previous year, due to President Trump's trade policies. The OECD projects further slowing to 1.5% in 2026, attributing the decline to disruptions in global commerce, increased costs, and uncertainty for businesses and consumers. Trump's tariffs have significantly raised average U.S. tariff rates, impacting both consumers and manufacturers.

The review calls for clearer direction from the government, improved long-term investment strategies, and greater community involvement.

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of excessive visitor numbers, a phenomenon known as overtourism. This issue stretches infrastructure, strains local resources, and disrupts local ecosystems through noise, litter, and landscape alterations. The rise in tourism emissions, particularly from air travel, exacerbates the climate crisis, while short trips contribute disproportionately to CO2 emissions. Some cities and regions are implementing measures such as limiting traveler numbers, imposing tourist taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers. Copenhagen is rewarding climate-friendly travelers with incentives, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts of overtourism.</p>

The withdrawal is attributed to the politicization of the water industry, deterring potential investors.

          <p>Red Bull's decision to order Max Verstappen to concede a position to George Russell after a Turn One incident in the Spanish Grand Prix is being questioned. The stewards later determined that no further action was necessary, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. Red Bull's decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires under a safety car is also under scrutiny, with Horner admitting they should have left him on his soft tires. These strategic missteps cost Verstappen valuable track position, impacting his overall race result.</p>

          <p>Beijing has increased warnings about cutthroat price wars among Chinese carmakers, citing concerns over deflationary pressures and the long-term health of the industry. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and state media have cautioned that these price wars could hinder sustained investment in research and development, ultimately affecting product quality. The MIIT vowed to increase governance over such competition, describing it as an example of "involutionary" competition. Concerns are growing about shrinking profit margins and industrial overcapacity within the domestic carmaking sector (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply reduced its growth forecast for the U.S. economy, projecting only 1.6% growth this year and 1.5% in 2026. The downgrade is attributed to the fallout from President Trump's trade policies, increased economic uncertainty, and a slowdown in net immigration. The OECD also adjusted its inflation forecast, noting that higher trade costs will likely push up inflation, though this may be partially offset by weaker commodity prices.

The decision follows concerns from President Trump about the fairness of Tesla building a factory in India.
