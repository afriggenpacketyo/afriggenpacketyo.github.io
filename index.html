          <p>The $TRUMP meme coin experienced a surge of over 50% after the top 220 holders were promised a dinner with former President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., alongside a VIP White House tour. Launched in January, the coin's market cap briefly soared to $15 billion, fueled by Trump's social media posts, before losing much of its value. Concerns remain about the coin's fundamentals, as it lacks an underlying product or service, and a large portion of the supply is held by insiders with a vesting schedule. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's proposed plan to end the war between Ukraine and Russia would reward Moscow for aggression and war crimes, according to this analysis. The plan involves lifting sanctions against Russia, accepting a cease-fire in place, and recognizing Crimea as part of Russia.

The proposal is viewed as an instrument of surrender that would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future aggression.</p>
