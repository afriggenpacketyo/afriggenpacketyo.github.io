        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investigators discovered seventeen bodies inside an abandoned house in Irapuato, Guanajuato, a Mexican state known for its high levels of cartel violence. The grim find occurred shortly after seven individuals, including children, were fatally shot in the same region. Authorities used ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs to locate the bodies, also uncovering knives, machetes, pickaxes, and shovels at the scene. Five of the victims have been identified as missing persons, with their families being notified by officials. The region's violence is attributed to conflicts between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the Jalisco New Generation cartel, both major players in Mexico's drug trade. The state recorded the highest number of homicides in Mexico last year, underscoring the severity of the ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Super Heavy-Starship rocket from its Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, after two previous flights ended in upper-stage failures. This mission incorporated several upgrades aimed at improving the rocket's performance and reliability. The Super Heavy first stage successfully separated from the Starship and executed a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage is targeting a splashdown in the Indian Ocean after releasing eight dummy Starlink satellites to test the deployment system and conducting other in-space experiments.

          <p>Former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, convicted on fraud and bribery charges, received a pardon from President Trump, who described Jenkins as a victim of the Biden Department of Justice. Jenkins had been found guilty of accepting $75,000 in bribes in exchange for making businessmen sworn law enforcement officers without proper training or vetting. Federal prosecutors asserted that Jenkins violated his oath of office by using his authority for personal enrichment. Jenkins, a long-time Trump supporter, is the latest ally of the president to receive a pardon. Trump stated that Judge Ballou refused to allow evidence to be shown, which Trump claims could have helped Jenkins' defense.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States between 2016 and 2023. Only about a quarter of mothers report having "excellent" mental health, with increases in those reporting "good" or "fair/poor" mental health. Declines were observed across all socioeconomic subgroups, but were more pronounced among single female parents, those with lower educational attainment, and those with publicly insured children. The study's authors suggest that these findings align with broader increases in depression and anxiety within the general U.S. adult population.</p>

Kennedy Jr. announced that the CDC would remove its recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and pregnant women, a move that has sparked controversy.

Experts fear this decision could limit access to vaccines for these groups and increase out-of-pocket costs, potentially conflicting with the FDA's stance on vaccine eligibility for pregnant women.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested a 20-year-old Venezuelan student at a New York City immigration courthouse, marking the first reported instance of a public school student being apprehended in the city this year. The arrest signals a shift in strategy by ICE to expedite deportations, targeting migrants attending scheduled hearings. The student, Dylan, was detained after attending a mandatory hearing and is now facing expedited removal proceedings. Mayor Eric Adams distanced himself from the arrest, stating it was a federal issue beyond his control.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering taking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move supported by investor Bill Ackman. This would end 17 years of federal control over the U.S. housing market. The government took control of the firms in 2008. Skeptics, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, warn it could disrupt the mortgage market. Trump confirmed that the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors.

          <p>The Colorado River basin has lost 27.8 million acre-feet of groundwater in the past 20 years, nearly equivalent to the full capacity of Lake Mead, according to a new study. This depletion is occurring 2.4 times faster than the loss of surface water, raising concerns about food production and economic stability across the U.S. The majority of groundwater losses have occurred in the Lower Colorado River basin, including Arizona, Nevada, and California. Experts attribute the losses to "overpumping," particularly for agriculture, and advocate for better management of groundwater supplies.</p>

One such clinic, Al-Basma Fertility Centre, was shelled, resulting in the loss of nearly 4,000 frozen embryos and over 1,000 samples of sperm and eggs. The clinic's director estimates that between 100 and 150 women have lost their only chance at having children.
