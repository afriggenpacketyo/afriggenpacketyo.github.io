With Sino-U.S. rivalry intensifying, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. Experts suggest a new loan could be announced during a visit by a Chinese leader to Japan later this year.

Prime Minister Starmer has repeatedly called for de-escalation, and questions have been raised within the government about the legality of getting involved. Washington's decision to act alone meant the UK did not have to make a difficult decision about authorizing US warplanes to use UK military bases.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil.

The call comes after Iranian state-owned media reported that Iran's parliament backed closing the Strait of Hormuz. Such a move could have profound consequences for the global economy, as a significant portion of the world's crude oil flows through the strait.</p>

The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. This has resulted in a thriving EV start-up sector and the world's largest public charging network.</p>
