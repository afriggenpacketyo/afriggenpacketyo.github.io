        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will immediately cease producing new products containing these dyes. This decision follows a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic food dyes with natural alternatives. The company stated that 10% of its products currently contain artificial dyes and that they have already invested in finding natural replacements, with many products already using natural or no colors. The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, but some states have enacted bans to restrict their use. The company plans to focus on beverages and desserts portfolios, including certain products sold under brands like Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range at its upcoming meeting. This decision reflects a cautious approach as the Fed monitors the impact of President Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs. While consumer sentiment has shown some improvement, uncertainty remains, and the inflation rate slightly increased in May to 2.4%. Experts predict a very high probability that the Fed will hold steady, citing a lack of compelling reasons to cut rates given the current economic conditions. The Fed's decision will be announced at 2 p.m. EST, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase after President Trump called for the evacuation of Tehran amidst escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. The U.S. crude oil contract for July delivery rose by 2.2% to $73.35 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent for August increased by 2.49% to $75.05. Trump stated that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and demanded the evacuation of Iran's capital city, though he mentioned there was no specific threat that led to his call for people in Tehran to evacuate. Despite the conflict, the oil market has remained relatively stable due to ample global crude supplies, with OPEC+ increasing production and U.S. output remaining at record levels.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are proceeding with an investigation into the alleged cover-up of former President Joe Biden's reported mental decline during his time in office. The hearing will feature testimony from former Trump administration officials and a legal scholar, who will offer their perspectives on how Biden's inner circle and the media purportedly concealed his declining health. Witnesses include Theodore Wold, Sean Spicer, and John Harrison, each expected to provide insights into the constitutional questions raised by a president whose health was reportedly declining.

Trump dismissed French President Macron's claim of a ceasefire offer, stating his return to Washington was due to more significant issues.

This milestone marks a significant shift in viewing habits, with streaming's share increasing by 71% since 2021, while broadcast and cable have declined. The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, the rise of YouTube, and traditional media companies shifting to streaming-centric models. YouTube now represents the highest share of any streamer, accounting for 12.5% of all television viewing.</p>

          <p>A cultural shift is occurring in which women are increasingly embracing strength training, challenging traditional beauty standards that prioritize thinness. Three new books explore the meaning of women embracing strength and the cultural symbolism of muscles. While strength training is seen as an empowering alternative, there is concern that old body neuroses from the pursuit of thinness are transferring to the new muscular ideal. The trend of women getting stronger is part of a larger wellness culture, where optimizing health is increasingly valued.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has reported that the small boats situation in the English Channel is "deteriorating," ahead of a key UK-France summit on border security. More than 1,500 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats last week, bringing the year's total to over 16,000, a 42% increase compared to the same period last year. The leaders of the UK and France have agreed to work closely to address the crossings, focusing on enhanced border security initiatives. Despite increased efforts, French authorities have intercepted fewer than 58% of recorded boat crossings this year.</p>

The new song warns of the consequences of drug trafficking, while the Jalisco prosecutor's office has reacted positively, suggesting the investigation could be suspended.
