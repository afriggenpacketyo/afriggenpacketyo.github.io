          <p>Recent widespread layoffs at the U.S. State Department have caused significant chaos and are raising concerns about national security, according to multiple sources. The Trump administration's move, intended to streamline the agency, was reportedly executed poorly, with some key offices like the Office of Casualty Assistance being entirely eliminated. Current and former officials warn that the arbitrary nature of the cuts, which affected even staff on official travel, could severely damage U.S. diplomatic capabilities and foreign relations. The disarray has left managers struggling to identify remaining team members and has disrupted critical functions, including consular services.</p>

          <p>A package of cryptocurrency regulation bills has advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives after a contentious, record-long 10-hour vote. The legislation faced opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, creating a two-day stalemate that raised doubts about the party's ability to unify on crypto policy. Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, the struggle to pass the debate rules highlighted significant internal divisions. The bills include measures to define the regulatory landscape for digital assets and a proposal to prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency.

          <p>An Emirates flight from Dubai to Hong Kong was forced to divert to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, after making at least two unsuccessful landing attempts. The Boeing 777 aircraft circled over the Hong Kong area before changing its destination, with passengers and crew staying overnight in Taiwan before returning to Hong Kong the next day. While the airline has not specified the exact cause, an aviation observer cited by media reports suggested that adverse weather conditions, including sustained winds of about 12 knots, may have contributed to the difficulties the pilots experienced during the landing approach.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced that "specific steps" have been agreed upon to end intense sectarian violence in southern Syria, following Israeli airstrikes on Syrian military targets in Damascus. The Israeli intervention was a response to clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes in Suweida province, which have reportedly killed over 300 people. Israel's Prime Minister stated the strikes were to protect the Druze community, while Syria's foreign ministry condemned them as "treacherous aggression." U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed optimism that the agreement would end the horrifying situation, and Syrian state media reported a military withdrawal from Suweida was underway.</p>

Seven & i, which operates the 7-Eleven chain, expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian firm's statements. The failed deal highlights the challenges foreign companies face with acquisitions in Japan, with one analyst noting that the "moat of Japanese protectionism" and the company's status as core to national security made the takeover highly unlikely from the start.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," newly obtained ICE data shows that a small fraction of those deported had convictions for violent crimes. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and most documented infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. The data, broken down by conviction type, indicates that about 1.8% of convictions were for sex offenses and 15.2% for assault. This report suggests the administration's deportation push has primarily affected undocumented immigrants without the severe criminal records that have been the focus of public messaging.</p>

A fruit vendor named Marta describes how she initially stopped working out of fear, impacting her family's income, and now works cautiously, constantly scanning her surroundings. She notes that sales are down because many in the community are also staying home and spending less. The story highlights the broader human and economic consequences of intensified immigration enforcement, forcing families to create emergency plans and altering the daily life of working-class communities who feel targeted regardless of criminal history.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June, marking the second straight month of decline and raising fears of a potential recession for the export-reliant economy. The drop was unexpected by economists and is exacerbated by ongoing trade disputes with the United States, which is set to impose a 25% tariff on Japanese imports. Shipments to key partners like the U.S. and China saw significant decreases, with automobile exports to the U.S. plunging by over 26%. The continued weak performance and tariff pressures could tip Japan's economy, which already contracted in the first quarter, into a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

While Trump publicly stated firing Powell is "highly unlikely," his history of contradicting such statements has kept concerns alive. Experts believe an attempt to remove the Fed chair would almost certainly lead to a legal battle resolved by the Supreme Court, creating unprecedented uncertainty and undermining the central bank's crucial independence from political pressure.

          <p>A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging a coordinated effort to arrest and deport people attending their own immigration hearings. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of twelve plaintiffs, claims the government is unconstitutionally turning immigration courts into traps, violating due process rights. The plaintiffs, many of whom were seeking asylum from violence, were arrested at hearings and placed in expedited removal proceedings. The suit argues this practice abandons legal norms and discourages people from complying with their legal obligations to appear in court, creating widespread fear within immigrant communities.</p>

The Czech team, including four cadaver dogs, arrived to help locate approximately 100 people still missing. This collaboration is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which has linked Texas with the Czech Republic for military training since 1993. The aid is reciprocal, as a Texas drone unit previously assisted the Czech Republic during its own severe flooding. Governor Greg Abbott surveyed the damage, emphasizing the intensive search for the unaccounted for.</p>

The picture, taken by photographer Chris Jackson, shows the Queen smiling in a casual setting at her private home in Wiltshire.

Unlike last year, when her birthday coincided with the State Opening of Parliament, she is expected to celebrate this year's occasion privately. The release comes after a busy period of public engagements for the Queen and King Charles, including a state visit and international travel.</p>

Crusoe, an AI cloud platform, is utilizing used EV batteries supplied by Redwood Materials to provide reliable, clean energy for its facilities near Reno, Nevada. This innovative approach addresses the growing concern that data centers could consume up to 12% of all U.S. electricity by 2028. By repurposing batteries that have lost some capacity but are still functional, the system offers a scalable, renewable alternative to building new gas-fired power plants.</p>

In a separate issue, he repeated a threat to redraw California's congressional districts to favor Democrats if Republicans proceed with similar partisan gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas.

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on businesses are exposing significant flaws in the E-Verify system, which is designed to confirm employment eligibility. One business owner in Nebraska, who used the system diligently, was a victim of a raid where over 70 of his employees were arrested for using stolen identities. Experts say that while E-Verify is mandated in many states, it is easy to fool because it vets documents, not people, making employers vulnerable and fueling identity theft. Critics call it a "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without imposing major costs on the economy, leaving businesses and workers in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of bipartisanship, Congress has passed legislation aimed at preventing thousands of military veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a crisis created after the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a key homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer affordable options to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The new law will allow veterans to move their delinquent payments to the end of their loan term, making their mortgages current and allowing them to resume regular payments. This solution was urgently sought by mortgage industry leaders and veterans' advocates to fix the gap in the VA's home loan program.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA program that funds natural disaster mitigation projects. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch acted illegally by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they claim rests with Congress. The states contend that halting the program jeopardizes hundreds of critical infrastructure projects, such as stormwater control systems and building elevations, leaving communities at higher risk from natural disasters. A recent investigation found that the funding cuts disproportionately affect counties that supported President Trump in the 2024 election.</p>

The former inspector general for USAID, Paul Martin, stated he saw no evidence of rampant issues and that the handful of examples cited by the administration were "completely made up." Anonymous USAID officials told NPR that the review process was a superficial search for politically charged keywords like "gender" or "climate," rather than a thorough investigation into program effectiveness.

With insurance costs spiraling since the Grenfell Tower fire, these percentage-based commissions have also increased, allegedly enriching freeholders. The legal action seeks the return of these commissions, which could amount to up to £2,000 per flat owner, and targets several large property ownership groups who deny any wrongdoing.</p>
