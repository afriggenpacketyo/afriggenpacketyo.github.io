            <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the U.S. is close to securing trade deals with more than 10 countries. This announcement comes amidst ongoing concerns about tariffs, with President Trump clarifying that there would be no exemptions for electronics. He also indicated that semiconductor tariffs would be moved to a different category, signaling a potential shift in trade strategy. The administration's stance on tariffs has been closely watched by industries reliant on global supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

This follows the implementation of automotive tariffs on imported vehicles earlier in the month.

            <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that the chances of a U.S. recession have increased following President Trump's tariffs, posing "material risks" to U.S. and global growth. The growing uncertainty over the fallout of U.S. tariffs could create trouble for companies and consumers. Solomon acknowledged the administration's focus on trade barriers but noted the U.S. has benefited from global trade arrangements. Goldman Sachs reported record revenues from its equity division, benefiting from market turmoil triggered by Trump's return to the Oval Office. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham is set to continue after bin workers overwhelmingly rejected the city council's latest pay offer. The strike, led by the Unite union, has resulted in significant rubbish accumulation on the streets. The dispute centers around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, which the union argues will lead to pay cuts for workers. The council claims its offer was fair and that workers would not lose any money.</p>
