          <h2>New Federal Law Overhauls Student Loan Repayment Options and Pell Grant Eligibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 09:56:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new federal law signed by President Trump significantly alters the U.S. student loan system, streamlining repayment options to just two plans: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven plan. The legislation also eliminates the Biden-era SAVE plan, with interest resuming for enrollees on August 1st. Furthermore, the law tightens eligibility for Pell Grants, making students with full scholarships ineligible, and introduces stricter borrowing caps for Parent PLUS loans and graduate student loans. While some experts see the simplification as an improvement, critics worry about extended repayment timelines and new financial barriers for students. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Search and rescue operations are ongoing in Central Texas following catastrophic flash floods that have claimed at least 121 lives, with over 170 people still missing. The majority of fatalities occurred in Kerr County, where a summer camp was devastated by the rapidly rising Guadalupe River. President Trump has issued a federal disaster declaration to support local efforts, which have been hampered by subsequent storms. Scrutiny has fallen on the adequacy of weather warnings and potential impacts of budget cuts to the National Weather Service, with state officials promising a review of emergency systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American families are facing higher prices for back-to-school essentials, with spending expected to decrease slightly as concerns about the economy and potential new tariffs loom. A Deloitte survey indicates that average spending per child will be around $570, down from the previous year, as many parents plan to switch to cheaper brands and cut back on non-essentials. President Trump's proposed tariffs, currently delayed until August 1st, threaten to drive prices even higher. This economic uncertainty is prompting consumers to shop earlier and more cautiously, though many parents still feel pressure to purchase popular items for their children. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Reform MP Rupert Lowe is under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards for allegedly failing to register over £600,000 in donations. The funds were raised through a Crowdfunder for his independent "Rape Gang Inquiry," a project examining gang-based sexual exploitation. Lowe maintains he has followed all rules, stating the donations were received by the inquiry on June 23rd, giving him until July 21st to meet the 28-day registration deadline. The inquiry, which includes Conservative MP Esther McVey on its board, plans to continue its work despite a separate government-backed investigation being announced.</p>

          <p>As of July 11, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,357.20 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The article explains that gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability and inflation. Multiple factors influence its price, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, interest rates have an inverse relationship with gold's appeal, while the strength of the U.S. dollar and central bank policies also play significant roles in determining its market value.

          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally is also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and concerns about the increasing federal deficit, which can make alternative assets like bitcoin more attractive. The significant price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further propelling the cryptocurrency's value as investors anticipate continued corporate adoption and potential crypto-friendly legislation.

          <p>A new book, "A Flower Traveled in My Blood," examines Argentina's decades-long effort to reckon with the state-sponsored terror of its 1976-83 military junta. The campaign of kidnapping, torture, sexual assault, and murder left up to 30,000 people dead or disappeared, creating lasting societal trauma. The book highlights the work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who used pioneering genetic tools to locate and identify 140 grandchildren born to captive mothers. Argentina's journey of amnesties, trials, and memorialization serves as a complex case study for how nations grapple with violent histories, balancing the pursuit of justice with the desire for peace.</p>

          <p>Intel is spinning out its AI robotics and biometrics division into a new, independent company called RealSense, which has secured a $50 million Series A funding round. The new entity, which develops technology for robotics automation, will use the capital to create new product lines and expand globally to meet growing demand. This move comes as major tech companies like Tesla and Amazon increase their investments in automation and humanoid robots. Intel, which has been undergoing cost-cutting measures, will retain a minority stake in RealSense, with a current Intel VP set to become the new company's CEO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire in Arizona, known as the White Sage Fire, has prompted the immediate evacuation of the Grand Canyon National Park's North Rim. Sparked by lightning, the fire has burned approximately 1,000 acres near Jacob Lake and remains 0% contained due to high temperatures, strong winds, and dry conditions. Authorities have closed a portion of a nearby state highway as emergency crews battle the blaze from both the ground and air. The wildfire threat is widespread, with other lightning-ignited fires also forcing evacuations in Colorado's Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park.</p>

The disciplinary actions, which ranged from 10 to 42 days of unpaid leave, came after intense scrutiny of the agency's security failures during the incident. A bipartisan House report found that pre-existing issues in leadership and training contributed to the lapse. A Secret Service official stated the agency is focused on fixing the root causes of the failure, including implementing new technology like drones and mobile command posts to improve operational capabilities.</p>

Previously, a flat-rate payment system allowed some centers to bill the state for more than their services cost and use public funds for real estate purchases.
