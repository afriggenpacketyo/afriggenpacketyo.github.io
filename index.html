          <p>The Trump administration has postponed any new tariff increases on Mexican imports for 90 days, maintaining the current 25% rate on goods like cars and a 50% rate on metals. This extension followed what President Trump described as a successful call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, aimed at providing time to negotiate a formal trade agreement. The U.S. seeks to address issues like cross-border crime and trade barriers, while Mexico has reportedly agreed to terminate its non-tariff barriers as part of the ongoing discussions.

          <p>The Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, who have long maintained fierce loyalty to Syria, are now facing a crisis of identity due to recent sectarian violence. Deadly clashes in southern Syria between Druze factions, Sunni Bedouin tribes, and Syrian government forces have led many Golani Druze to feel disillusioned with Syria's new interim government. This conflict has prompted some to cross the border to aid relatives, while also highlighting deep-seated ethnic and religious rifts that challenge Syria's stability.</p>

          <p>A 20-minute failure in the UK's air traffic control system on Wednesday resulted in significant travel chaos, leading to 150 flight cancellations and ongoing delays. The national air traffic service, NATS, attributed the problem to a radar display issue at its Swanwick center, which was resolved by switching to a backup system. Airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet have heavily criticized NATS for the second major failure since 2023, while experts explain that such outages degrade the airspace network's capacity from a 'motorway to a country lane'.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals to penalize large companies that consistently fail to pay their smaller suppliers on time, a practice blamed for the failure of thousands of businesses annually. Under the plan, the small business commissioner would gain the authority to fine firms with over 250 employees if they fail to pay a quarter of their invoices on time. The proposal also aims to cap invoice payment terms at a maximum of 60 days to improve cash flow for small businesses.</p>

          <p>CVS Health's shares jumped over 6% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates and raised its adjusted profit forecast for the year. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and signs of improvement in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing higher medical costs. The company now projects adjusted earnings between $6.30 and $6.40 per share, signaling confidence in its ongoing turnaround and cost-cutting efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments in a significant case challenging President Trump's authority to impose broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court had previously blocked the tariffs, ruling the president lacked the authority, but the duties were temporarily reinstated pending this appeal. The challengers, a group of states and small businesses, argue that the president's use of IEEPA oversteps constitutional authority, which vests the power to set tariffs in Congress.
