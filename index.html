          <p>The Department of Justice has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside an immigration detention center in Newark. Simultaneously, a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka, stemming from the same incident, has been dropped. According to the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, McIver was charged for assaulting, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement. McIver maintains the charges are politically motivated, mischaracterizing her actions and criminalizing legislative oversight, while Habba states the charges against Baraka were dropped for the sake of moving forward. The incident occurred during an oversight visit to the detention center, resulting in a physical altercation between lawmakers, ICE agents, and the mayor, leading to Baraka's initial arrest for trespassing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed course, allowing construction to resume on the Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island. This decision comes a month after a highly unusual stop-work order threatened the $5 billion project's collapse. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she pressed President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lift the hold, emphasizing the project's importance. The project, being built by Equinor, is expected to power 500,000 New York homes, and the reversal saves over 1,000 jobs among workers from parts of New York that supported him. The Trump administration had previously halted work, citing concerns that the permits had been rushed, however it never shared evidence of its claims with either the company or the public.</p>

Students are now more interested in trades as a pathway to well-paying jobs, with some blue-collar positions earning six-figure salaries.

The inmates, facing charges including murder and armed robbery, escaped through a hole in a cell wall and crossed Interstate 10 on foot, leaving behind a taunting message. Four inmates have been captured, while six remain at large, leading officials to caution residents and seek public assistance. The jail, under federal consent decree since 2013, has faced issues including overcrowding, understaffing, and defective security measures, drawing criticism from a federal monitor and Governor Jeff Landry.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build consensus between hardliners demanding more cuts and moderates reluctant to slash Medicaid, aiming to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess.

          <p>A Lufthansa plane flew for approximately 10 minutes without a pilot when the co-pilot became incapacitated while the captain was outside the cockpit, according to a report from Spain's Ministry of Transport and Sustainable Mobility. The incident occurred during a flight from Frankfurt to Seville in February 2024, when the captain could not re-enter the cockpit after the co-pilot suffered a sudden medical emergency. The plane's autopilot remained engaged during the period without pilot supervision, and the captain eventually regained access to the cockpit and diverted the plane to Madrid, where it landed safely.</p>

          <p>President Trump has shifted from his initial compassionate response to Joe Biden’s cancer diagnosis, using it to question Biden's ability to lead the country. Trump suggested that Biden hid his cancer diagnosis while in office and questioned why Biden’s physical last year didn’t include cognitive tests. Trump's remarks have been criticized as insensitive, especially considering the severity of Biden's diagnosis, which is Stage 4 cancer with a Gleason score of 9.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has returned three ancient artworks to the Republic of Iraq after determining they were looted. The artworks, including a Sumerian vessel and two Babylonian ceramic sculptures, were recovered following criminal investigations into looted art, particularly involving the British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. The artifacts were returned in an official ceremony attended by Met officials and representatives from Iraq. The Manhattan district attorney’s office said the investigation into Symes led to the seizure of 135 antiquities trafficked through Manhattan, valued at $58 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, which imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation, including the dissemination of AI-created "deepfakes." The bill, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such content within 48 hours. While receiving bipartisan support, the measure has faced criticism from free speech advocates who argue it is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images and undermine due process.</p>

          <p>The Heritage Foundation is facing criticism for using antisemitic tropes in a fundraising pitch for Project Esther, a campaign aimed at dismantling the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States. The campaign's illustration featured Jewish billionaires like George Soros and Governor JB Pritzker in a pyramid of “progressive elites,” echoing classic antisemitic conspiracy theories. Project Esther, largely conceived by Christian Zionists, defines the pro-Palestinian movement broadly, including attempts to shift American foreign policy away from unconditional support for Israel, even by progressive Jews. The organization’s distorted definition of antisemitism has influenced Trump's policies, leading to defunding universities and attempting to deport pro-Palestinian student activists.</p>

          <p>Conservatives have been holding out against the major tax and spending cut package to implement President Trump’s agenda, arguing it will swell federal deficits. The Moody’s downgrade underscored their concerns. A recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, citing congressional gridlock and a Republican fiscal plan projected to increase the federal deficit, has emboldened fiscally conservative Republicans to demand deeper cuts to federal programs. These lawmakers are using the downgrade as evidence that their concerns about growing federal debt are valid, potentially prolonging political paralysis in Congress.</p>

          <p>Jeff deGraaf, Renaissance Macro's chairman, identifies a "20-day high thrust" as an "escape velocity" signal indicating a robust stock market recovery and a potential bull market. This indicator, triggered when over 20% of S&P 500 stocks hit 20-day highs, suggests that the market has reached a sustainable bottom. Historically, the stock market has rallied an average of 16% 12 months after this signal, although pullbacks of around 10% are common. DeGraaf also notes that a rising number of bulls compared to bears is a positive sign, and he is looking for a higher percentage of stocks above their 20-day moving average to confirm the market's health.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to pay a $5 million settlement to the family of Ashli Babbitt, a US Air Force veteran who was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer while breaching the US Congress on January 6, 2021. The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Babbitt's family claimed that the decision to open fire by Capitol Police officer Michael Byrd was negligent. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed disappointment with the decision, while Trump has previously praised Babbitt and promised to "look into" the lawsuit brought by her family.</p>
