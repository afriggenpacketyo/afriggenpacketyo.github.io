          <h2>Potential House GOP Rebellion Over Anti-Abortion Measure in Trump's Budget Bill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A measure in President Trump's budget reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing potential opposition from moderate House Republicans. Representative Mike Lawler expressed concerns about the definition of groups providing abortion services, warning of a "hornet's nest." The measure seeks to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers. With a narrow three-vote margin in the House, Republicans can't afford much dissent. The bill also targets Medicaid dollars going to states that provide healthcare to illegal immigrants and repeals certain Biden administration green energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed new charges against real estate moguls Oren and Tal Alexander, along with their brother Alon, including additional counts of alleged sexual assault and sex trafficking, one of which involves a minor.

Mahathir believes ASEAN nations can withstand the tariff impact through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States.

The order would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The plan aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, though it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry.

          <p>China and the United States have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern, following ministerial-level talks in Geneva. The high-level meeting was described as "candid, in-depth and constructive," marking an important step toward resolving differences. Senior officials from both countries held their first face-to-face contact since the Trump administration increased tariffs on goods from China. In response to Trump's tariffs, China imposed duties on U.S. products and restricted exports of critical minerals.</p>

          <p>Huntar, a US-owned toy factory in China that manufactures toys for Walmart and Target, is facing closure due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The tariffs have led to canceled orders and a sharp decline in production, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of Chinese workers and 15 US employees. The company is attempting to relocate its operations to Vietnam, but faces significant financial and logistical hurdles. The plight of Huntar exemplifies the crisis facing countless factories in China, where a significant portion of toys sold in the U.S. are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Taiwan have come under scrutiny for removing the ‚ÄúHan‚Äù category from demographic groups listed on the official information page. The change is seen as an effort to further distance the island from mainland China. The revised web page of Taiwan‚Äôs Executive Yuan categorizes Han Chinese ‚Äì the overwhelming majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait ‚Äì as ‚Äúother population‚Äù. The move comes as Taiwan‚Äôs ruling Democratic Progressive Party intensifies its efforts to promote the island‚Äôs indigenous identity while gradually eroding its historical and cultural ties with the mainland.</p>

He believes that both sides are realizing the current path hurts everyone, making a deal likely. Yao suggests a rollback to the original 34% tariff level as a possible first step. He also mentions that the US might demand China buy more American goods as part of any negotiation.

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally praised for affordability and supporting longevity, is under strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population. The system's future is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the system into a political issue could undermine its stability and public trust. Prime Minister Ishiba's government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings. Proposed changes to out-of-pocket caps for high medical costs have sparked backlash, leading to a freeze on envisioned hikes.</p>

The offer comes on the eve of Trump's visit to the Middle East. The plane would be donated to Trump's presidential library when he leaves office. The offer would be one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government, and raises legal and ethical questions. Democrats questioned whether the deal was even legal.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, resulting in widespread flight delays and cancellations. The latest outage involved a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. The FAA confirmed that operations have returned to normal, but the incident has caused a domino effect with flights, impacting both domestic and international travel. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to temporarily cut the number of flights at Newark to address the airport's ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision to protect U.S. animals and the nation's food supply. The New World screwworm larvae burrow into wounds of animals and feed on their flesh and blood. The U.S. and Mexico eradicated the pest in the 1960s and '70s, but cases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in some "remote farms" in Mexico.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal is what he calls a ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äù pricing model. The plan will most likely be subject to challenges in court, and it is not clear whether it will pass legal muster, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>
