          <p>A large-scale search and rescue mission is in its third day for a 52-year-old mountain biker who went missing near Mount Hood, Oregon. The experienced biker, Ralph Sawyer, was reported overdue on Friday evening after a planned trip. Authorities located his vehicle and cellphone at a trailhead, but Sawyer remains missing despite the deployment of nearly 70 personnel, canine units, and drones. The search is focused on the extensive trail network around Trillium Lake, an area familiar to the missing man, who was last seen in his biking gear.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has announced that its corporate employees must return to the office four days a week starting in October. As part of this policy shift, the company is offering a voluntary exit program with a cash payout for those who do not wish to comply. CEO Brian Niccol stated the decision is crucial for the company's turnaround strategy, which focuses on improving efficiency and the customer experience amid slumping sales. This move follows previous efforts to increase in-office presence and streamline operations, including job cuts earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has entered into a contract to utilize Grok, the AI chatbot from Elon Musk's xAI, as part of a broader government initiative. This move is facilitated by the new "Grok for Government" suite, which makes xAI's models available to federal agencies through the General Services Administration. The announcement follows recent controversy where Grok generated antisemitic content, which the company stated it quickly addressed. This partnership aligns with the Trump administration's push to adopt advanced AI for national security and other governmental operations, despite Musk's recent public disagreements with the president.</p>

          <h2>Examining the 'Age 75 Rule' for Purchasing Annuities in Retirement Planning</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the informal "age 75 rule" for annuities, a common belief that retirees should wait until that age to purchase one to secure higher payouts. It explains that while payouts do increase with age due to shorter life expectancy calculations, waiting is not always the best strategy. Delaying an annuity purchase can expose savings to market risk and deplete assets needed for earlier retirement years. The piece advises that the optimal time to buy an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including financial goals, health, and other income sources, rather than a universal age benchmark.

This dual-pronged strategy marks a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin, with Trump expressing frustration over the prolonged conflict.

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, dating back 3,500 years, at a site in Guam. The discovery was made in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery within a cave. Researchers believe the rice was not used for daily consumption but played a role in specialized rituals performed at the site, which also contained rare rock art and formal burials. This finding suggests the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a remarkable 2,300-kilometer open-ocean journey.</p>

          <p>As the new academic year approaches, this article provides guidance on choosing between federal and private student loans. It recommends that students first exhaust all federal loan options due to their fixed interest rates, income-driven repayment plans, and potential for forgiveness. However, federal loans have borrowing limits that may not cover the full cost of attendance. Private loans can fill this funding gap but often have variable rates, fewer borrower protections, and require a strong credit history or a co-signer. The best strategy involves using federal loans as a foundation and cautiously using private loans to cover remaining costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for food and beverages that is derived from the fruit of the gardenia plant. The additive, made from the compound genipin, is approved for use in products like sports drinks, candies, and ready-to-drink teas. This marks the fourth naturally sourced color approved by the FDA in the last two months, aligning with a broader push to phase out petroleum-based dyes in the U.S. food supply. The approval has been praised by health advocates as a positive step for consumer health.</p>

          <p>Two recent judicial rulings in lawsuits brought by authors against AI companies Anthropic and Meta have provided a nuanced, rather than decisive, outlook on the use of copyrighted material for training AI. Both judges determined that the training process constituted "fair use" because it was transformative, but they disagreed on key points, such as whether AI-generated books create unfair market competition. The rulings also left the companies vulnerable to litigation over their use of pirated book libraries. The article suggests these cases are just the first steps in a complex legal battle that will define the future of generative AI.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent launch of an EPA website to debunk the "chemtrails" conspiracy theory has drawn criticism from experts. They argue that the effort is undermined by the administration's own history of promoting other conspiracy theories and spreading climate misinformation. While the EPA page correctly explains that the vapor trails from aircraft are contrails, not chemical agents, critics point to the irony of this action. The administration, including the Health and Human Services Secretary, has previously given credence to the chemtrails theory, creating a confusing and low-trust information environment.</p>

The investment bank shifted its rating on the cybersecurity firm to "equal weight," suggesting it's time to "take a breather" after a 50% stock rise since April, citing a high valuation. Cramer, however, views the subsequent dip as a buying opportunity, expressing confidence in the company's second-half performance. He believes customers will transition to full-price packages after promotional deals, introduced following a major IT glitch last year, expire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's threat to impose secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian exports if a peace deal in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. These sanctions would target third-party nations like China and India, which have become crucial trade partners for Moscow, potentially crippling Russia's war economy more effectively than previous measures. While Russia's economy has shown resilience, it is facing a slowdown, and the threat of such sanctions could significantly impact its financial stability. The effectiveness of this threat will depend on the willingness of Russia's partners to risk U.S. penalties.</p>

Democrats claim the plan is a partisan effort to disenfranchise voters in the key battleground state. The notice gives the board 90 days to address the issue before a lawsuit is filed.</p>
