          <p>Democratic legislators have fled Texas to prevent Republicans from achieving a quorum needed to pass a new congressional map. The proposed map is heavily criticized for gerrymandering that would significantly expand the GOP's majority in the state's U.S. House delegation. This action escalates a political battle with Governor Greg Abbott, who has threatened to remove the absent lawmakers from office, while Democrats argue they are protecting the democratic process from being rigged in favor of one party. The move mirrors past quorum breaks in Texas politics over contentious legislation.</p>

          <p>Over 3,000 unionized Boeing defense workers have initiated a strike after rejecting the company's latest contract proposal regarding pay, pensions, and work schedules. The strike affects facilities in Missouri and Illinois responsible for producing military aircraft like the F-15 fighter jet. This labor action adds to the challenges facing the aviation giant, which has been dealing with safety scandals and a costly strike by its passenger plane workers last year. Boeing stated it is disappointed but prepared for the walkout with a contingency plan.</p>

          <p>A boat carrying approximately 157 migrants capsized in bad weather off the coast of Yemen, resulting in at least 68 deaths, with dozens more still missing. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that most of the victims are believed to be Ethiopian nationals using the dangerous sea route to reach Gulf states for work. This tragedy highlights the perilous journey migrants face, often exploited by smugglers in the conflict-ridden nation. The IOM has called for enhanced legal migration pathways to prevent such disasters.</p>

          <p>The brutal arrest of a Black college student in Florida, captured on his own dash-mounted phone, is intensifying calls for citizens to record their interactions with law enforcement. The student's video provided a clear view of an officer punching him in the head, details not visible in the police bodycam footage or mentioned in the official report. Civil rights attorneys argue the recording is crucial evidence of police misconduct and systemic issues like "driving while Black." The incident has sparked a debate on the role of citizen videography in police accountability.</p>

          <p>An analysis from the BBC suggests Manchester City's most significant summer acquisition might be coach Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former assistant at Liverpool, rather than a new player. The article posits that hiring Lijnders indicates a potential major tactical shift for manager Pep Guardiola, moving towards a more direct, high-intensity style of play. This change is seen as an adaptation to the evolving Premier League, where transition-based football is becoming more dominant. Recent player signings also appear to support this move towards a more dynamic and less possession-focused approach.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech firms Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotechnology sector. This development signals a maturation of the industry, which has historically relied on investor funding. Innovent's profitability is expected to be driven partly by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which competes with popular GLP-1 drugs from international pharmaceutical giants. This achievement demonstrates the growing ability of Chinese biotech companies to create and commercialize valuable medical products. (not investment advice)</p>

Yassin lost both of his legs in an airstrike in April while searching for toys in the rubble of his home, which also killed his father. After facing numerous challenges leaving Gaza, he will now receive treatment and be fitted for prosthetics in the U.S. His arrival is part of a larger effort to bring injured Palestinian children to America for medical care unavailable in the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>A riot at the Taxpan prison in the eastern Mexican state of Veracruz has resulted in the deaths of seven inmates and left eleven others injured. The unrest, which included fires set within the facility, reportedly broke out due to inmates' anger over alleged extortion and abuse by members of the Grupo Sombra criminal organization inside the prison. The incident highlights the persistent and severe problems within Mexico's penal system, including overcrowding and the powerful influence of cartels and gangs that often control prisons from within.</p>
