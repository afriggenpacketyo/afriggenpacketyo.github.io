          <p>A 19-year-old man in New Zealand died after sustaining a head injury while participating in the "RUNIT" challenge, a new social media trend involving full-contact collisions without protective gear. Police are urging participants to consider the significant safety and injury risks associated with the game, which loosely resembles elements of rugby and the NFL. The RUNIT Championship League, which promotes the sport and offers cash prizes, has been criticized by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury. The league released a statement saying it does not encourage copying the sport outside of strictly controlled conditions.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities confiscated two African lions and arrested a man in Punjab province for walking one of them through the streets while wielding an automatic rifle, an act that caused public panic. The man was creating a TikTok video, and now faces up to seven years in prison for illegal possession of lions and endangering public safety. Under the Punjab Wildlife Act, keeping or displaying big cats in urban areas is a criminal offense, and authorities have banned sharing dangerous videos involving big cats on social media. The government in Punjab recently launched an app to regulate big cat ownership, as there are over 100 private breeding houses in the province.</p>

          <p>UK food inflation has risen to an annual high of 2.8%, driven by higher beef and fresh produce prices, according to industry data. The boss of steakhouse chain Fazenda stated that they have increased prices due to the rising cost of beef, which has gone up about 20% in the last 12 months. Farming industry experts attribute the beef price increase to high demand and low supply, exacerbated by a lack of government support. The British Meat Processors Association warns that it is a "real struggle" for the industry to keep up with demand for beef, claiming that government schemes have not supported production.</p>

The letter instructs federal agencies to end contracts and find alternative vendors for future services. This action follows previous measures, including freezing $3.2 billion in grants and contracts and attempting to halt the university's ability to enroll international students.

          <p>The Congo River Alliance (AFC) and M23 rebel groups claim that former Congolese President Joseph Kabila is in Goma, beyond the reach of government forces, leading to renewed political tensions. Kabila, who served as president from 2001 to 2019, recently criticized the Tshisekedi government's decision to remove his immunity from prosecution. Some observers fear Kabila's reemergence in a rebel-held area could jeopardize existing mediation efforts, while others argue that sidelining him is counterproductive. Political analyst Kibangula notes that there is no strong popular nostalgia for Kabila, but Tshisekedi has accused him of plotting an "insurrection" with the M23.</p>

          <p>Two of the ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail on May 16 remain at large, after three more were re-arrested on Monday. Authorities are still searching for Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves, while at least 11 people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees. The inmates broke out of the Orleans Justice Center by exploiting a faulty cell door, squeezing through a hole, and scaling a barbed-wire fence. City and state officials have cited multiple security lapses, including a jail maintenance worker accused of turning off the water to the toilet to aid the escape.</p>

          <p>Recent data suggests that Gen Z is dividing into two distinct groups: "Old Gen Z" (ages 25-29), who are more Democratic and progressive, and "Young Gen Z" (ages 18-24), who are more open to Trump and skeptical of the status quo. Polling data from Harvard and Yale indicates that younger Gen Z voters hold more favorable views of Republicans and are more likely to identify with the GOP. Increased religiosity among younger Gen Z men is also noted, correlating with more conservative views. These trends could challenge the notion of a rising Democratic electorate and pose challenges for both major political parties.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions board is considering a proposal for sudden-death extra time, known as "golden point," if the deciding third Test against Australia this summer ends in a draw. Rugby Australia chief Phil Waugh suggested the idea, aiming to provide a more decisive outcome for fans. The proposal needs approval from the Lions board and both participating teams. Super Rugby Pacific has already implemented golden point for regular season games, but knockout games use standard extra time followed by golden point if necessary.</p>

          <p>The use of extended putter shafts, known as broom-handle putters, is once again under scrutiny on the PGA Tour after Matti Schmid's performance. A rule introduced in 2016 banned anchoring the putter against the body, but some golfers continue to use longer implements, raising questions about whether the technique makes putting "too easy." While clamping the shaft against a forearm is permitted, some argue that even this technique provides an unfair advantage. Experts suggest limiting the maximum length of putters to address the issue, ensuring fair play and enforceability.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident in Liverpool that injured dozens, police quickly released details about the driver, identifying him as a 53-year-old white British man. This decision aimed to prevent the spread of misinformation, as false anti-Muslim speculation had previously occurred after violent episodes. The police's rapid disclosure contrasts with their response to a stabbing in Southport last summer, where limited information led to widespread erroneous reports and subsequent riots. The Merseyside Police's actions reflect a heightened awareness of the need to counter online rumors and maintain public order.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, but cautioned that it would "cost a lot of money". The policy, which restricts means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017, has been criticized for pushing families into poverty. The decision on the cap is expected in the autumn when the government releases its child poverty strategy. The Child Poverty Taskforce is examining the cap, and "nothing is off the table," Phillipson said.</p>
