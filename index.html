          <p>A Department of Environmental Protection employee was killed and two others were injured in an explosion aboard a sewage boat docked on the Hudson River in West Harlem. The incident occurred at the North River Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility near 135th Street, causing heavy black smoke to billow into the air. The deceased worker, a veteran of 33 years, was reportedly blown between the pier and the vessel, while the injured were taken to local hospitals. The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating the cause, suspecting it may be linked to hot work on the boat, though officials state there is no suspicion of criminality or environmental impact. The plant's operations remain unaffected by the incident.</p>

          <p>The UK's South Western Railways has become the first private operator to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the move as a watershed moment, ending 30 years of fragmentation and aiming to improve service for passengers. The government anticipates saving up to Â£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators through this initiative. While rail unions support the takeover, citing the failures of privatization, the Labour government acknowledges that change will take time to fully implement.</p>

          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City and charged with kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist he allegedly lured to his SoHo home under the pretense of retrieving Bitcoin. The victim, who arrived from Italy on May 6, was reportedly tied up and tortured for weeks, with prosecutors detailing graphic acts including electric shocks and cutting his leg with a saw. Evidence recovered from the scene included weapons, body armor, and disturbing photos of the victim, who managed to escape and alert authorities.

          <p>A British fishing vessel has been impounded by French authorities for allegedly fishing illegally in French waters. The French coast guard stated that the vessel was stopped in the English Channel and is being held at the port of Boulogne while authorities consider prosecution. The incident follows criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's deal with the EU, which grants EU vessels continued access to UK waters. Conservatives have accused France of double standards, while the UK Foreign Office is providing support to the British national involved. </p>

          <p>The story of Michelle Renee, a California mother who was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000, is revisited, highlighting the challenges she faced in court despite being the victim. Renee and her daughter were held hostage, strapped with fake dynamite, and forced to comply with the kidnappers' demands. Despite overwhelming evidence against the perpetrators, Renee's past as a stripper and inconsistencies in her resume were used to discredit her during the trial. Ultimately, the suspects were convicted, but the ordeal left a lasting impact on Renee and her daughter, Breea, who later faced her own health challenges.</p>

          <p>A group of physicians and social workers in Japan are denouncing the continued COVID-19 restrictions at hospitals, deeming them a violation of human rights, as many facilities still limit patient visitations despite the government downgrading the threat level of the virus. The restrictions, which include mask requirements, temperature checks, and visitor limits, prevent families from seeing hospitalized loved ones, even in terminal cases. While the health ministry recommends considering visitations, the specific policies are left to individual hospitals, leading to inconsistent practices across the country, even as evidence suggests visitation restrictions are ineffective in preventing the spread of infections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may be passing their anxiety to their pets. Researchers found that dogs of owners with higher job stress showed more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and restlessness. The connection is driven by "work-related rumination," where owners mentally take work home, spreading stress from humans to pets. This is due to "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through cues like tone of voice and body language, and changes in care routines when owners are distracted.</p>

The hit came after Dodgers pitcher Tony Gonsolin struggled with command, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases.

Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, going deep into the game with sharp command and multiple double plays.

          <p>Amidst significant global shifts and a deteriorating relationship between the US and China, there are rising concerns about China's economic practices and its impact on the global economy. Some analysts suggest that China should boost domestic consumption to better absorb its excess production. Hong Kong, with its unique position and understanding of both Western and Chinese systems, can play a crucial role in promoting and defending a rules-based international order. This includes facilitating dialogue, promoting transparency, and advocating for fair trade practices.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions and increase salaries for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to growing competition for culinary talent. The new scheme, set to begin in January, will raise annual pay to over 6 million yen ($41,000), up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen. The chefs will also be allowed to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government, and the contracts will be for two years with a possible one-year extension. The move aims to enhance the promotion of Japanese cuisine internationally.</p>

Judge Brian Murphy found the removal likely lacked due process, noting the man's fears of returning to Mexico, where he had been raped and held for ransom.

Reform UK plans to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers.

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the influential feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, significantly shaping modern perspectives on the issue. The book sparked societal changes, including the establishment of rape-crisis centers and legal reforms to make prosecuting rapists easier. However, Brownmiller's work also faced criticism for its generalizations about men and controversial views on victim responsibility, highlighting the complexities and debates within the feminist movement.</p>
