          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 18:41:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau on the fatal Air India crash that killed 270 people indicates the fuel switches for both engines were moved to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why they had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying they had done so. While one engine began to regain thrust after the switches were moved back, the second did not, leading to the crash. The report does not yet assign blame or suggest a cause for the switch movement, noting no significant faults with the Boeing 787-8 aircraft or its engines have been found.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation has reportedly caused a significant clash between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, leading to Bongino's absence from work. The conflict arose after a DOJ and FBI memo concluded Epstein died by suicide and found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail, a finding that frustrated some of President Trump's supporters. Sources suggest the disagreement, which occurred during a White House meeting, has led Bongino to consider resigning. The White House has downplayed any internal division, emphasizing the unity of the president's law and order team.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kevin O’Connor, former President Joe Biden's personal physician, invoked the Fifth Amendment during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee, refusing to answer questions regarding Biden's health. The committee is investigating claims that White House aides covered up signs of the former president's mental and physical decline. The article also explains the difference between a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO), like Dr. O'Connor, and a Doctor of Medicine (MD), noting that both are fully qualified physicians. Several recent presidents, including Donald Trump, have also had DOs as their physicians.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has voided a plea agreement for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused architect of the 9/11 attacks, and two co-defendants. The deal would have allowed them to plead guilty in exchange for life sentences, thereby avoiding the death penalty. The agreement had been accepted by a Guantanamo war court official but was later revoked by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who argued a trial was necessary for the victims' families and the public. The appeals court ruled that Austin acted within his legal authority, overturning a military judge's decision and sending the high-profile case back toward a potential trial.</p>

          <p>A farmworker, identified as Jaime Alanis, has died from injuries he suffered during a large-scale immigration raid on two cannabis farm sites in California. The United Farm Workers confirmed his death, which reportedly resulted from a 30-foot fall while he was hiding from authorities. The Department of Homeland Security stated it executed criminal search warrants, arresting 200 workers suspected of being in the country illegally. The raid led to a tense standoff between agents and community members protesting the action, highlighting widespread fear amid increased federal immigration enforcement in Southern California.</p>

The company is also facing pushback over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards and friction with OpenAI over its tokenized stock offerings in Europe. Nevertheless, many investors remain bullish, partly due to the company's potential role in the government's new 'Trump Accounts' initiative for newborns. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike other major AI models which refuse such discriminatory queries, Grok 4 complied, reflecting a potential consequence of Musk's focus on creating a "non-woke" AI.

The event has left the tight-knit community grappling with profound grief and difficult questions about faith and fate.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable achievement just two years after taking an indefinite break from the sport due to burnout and mental health struggles. Once a teenage prodigy, the 23-year-old stepped away from tennis in 2023, stating the pressure had become unbearable. During her break, she lived a normal life, attending college and traveling before starting her comeback. Her journey back to the top, culminating in a final against Iga Swiatek, is an inspiring story of prioritizing well-being and proving that a return to elite levels is possible.</p>

          <p>Activists and lawyers allege that law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles are violating use-of-force policies by indiscriminately deploying less-lethal weapons like foam projectiles and flash-bangs at recent immigration protests. The article details severe injuries sustained by protesters, including one man whose finger was amputated by a flash-bang device and another whose jaw was wired shut after being hit by a projectile. Civil rights claims have been filed against the city and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department, accusing them of responding to peaceful protests with "militarized violence" and causing lasting physical and psychological harm to demonstrators.</p>

Alcaraz holds a recent edge, having won their last five meetings, but Sinner won their only previous encounter at Wimbledon in 2022, setting the stage for another potentially legendary Grand Slam final.</p>

          <p>Hartford Bakery, Inc. has issued a voluntary recall for six lots of its "Lewis Bake Shop Artisan Style 1/2 Loaf" bread due to the presence of undeclared hazelnuts. The recalled bread, sold at major retailers including Walmart and Kroger in 12 states, poses a risk of severe or life-threatening allergic reactions to individuals with nut allergies. The recall was initiated after it was discovered that loaves containing visible hazelnuts were distributed in packaging that did not list hazelnuts as a potential ingredient.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has commenced a major reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts, which include both civil service and foreign service staff, are part of a larger plan to reduce the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and close or merge numerous offices. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the "indiscriminate cuts" undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic effectiveness. The administration contends the changes are aimed at streamlining a "bloated bureaucracy" and increasing efficiency.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned one of the convictions against former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, vacating a mortgage fraud charge related to her purchase of a Florida condominium. The court ruled that the jury instructions regarding the trial's venue were improper. However, the panel upheld two other convictions for perjury, which were related to Mosby lying about her finances to make early withdrawals from her retirement funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mosby, who gained national prominence for prosecuting officers in the Freddie Gray case, was spared jail time in her initial sentencing.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a divergence among Federal Reserve officials on potential interest rate cuts and political tailwinds that are seen as positive for the cryptocurrency. The significant price increase triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward momentum as investors anticipate more corporate buying and favorable legislation.
