          <p>Candy giant Ferrero North America is adapting its products to appeal to American consumers by adding peanuts to Nutella, reshaping Ferrero Rocher, and introducing a Dr Pepper-flavored Tic Tac. These changes are part of Ferrero's strategy to increase its U.S. market share and compete with Hershey and Mars. The company has grown through acquisitions, including Nestle's U.S. candy business, and now focuses on organic growth through innovation, with executives stating the U.S. is the most important market. Despite sales struggles for other candy companies, Ferrero's U.S. business has seen growth, driven by its strategy to incorporate American tastes into its global brands.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era Venus lander, Cosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, posing minimal threat despite its resilience to Venus's harsh conditions. The probe, weighing 495 kilograms, failed to leave Earth's orbit and has been orbiting ever since, and most space debris burns up upon re-entry, the design of Cosmos 482 means some parts may survive. Experts are tracking its descent, with calculations aided by its smooth aerodynamic shape, and the annual risk of injury from space debris remains low. Russia plans to launch a new Venus mission, Venera-D, in the early 2030s, continuing exploration of the planet.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has initiated investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for potentially violating the UK's new child safety regulations. These regulations, set to be enforced starting in July, require all websites hosting pornographic content to implement robust age-verification mechanisms. The regulator said the two services it was investigating did not appear to have any effective age checking mechanisms. The companies under investigation failed to provide details on how they plan to prevent children from accessing their platforms, which could result in significant fines if found in breach of the Online Safety Act.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear a case regarding the constitutionality of President Trump's attempt to strip birthright citizenship from many Americans. The case also raises the question of whether a single federal judge can issue a nationwide injunction, which binds the entire country. The court's decision could significantly impact the ability of lower courts to check the power of the Trump administration. Limiting nationwide injunctions could give Trump more leeway to implement policies even after lower courts deem them illegal or unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's security service (SBU) reports uncovering a Hungarian state-run spy network allegedly gathering intelligence on Ukrainian defenses near their shared border. Two alleged Hungarian spies have been detained, accused of collecting data on air defense systems and law enforcement in the Zakarpattia region. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto dismissed the allegations as potential propaganda, awaiting official information from Kyiv. The SBU claims the spies, former Ukrainian military members, were supervised by a Hungarian intelligence officer, with the male suspect allegedly crossing the border to report and receive payment and equipment.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, citing concerns about constraining the government's fiscal space. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi emphasized that the consumption tax is a key revenue source for debt-ridden Japan, making a rate reduction inappropriate. While the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is reluctant, its coalition partner is considering a consumption tax cut on food items. The government plans to outline measures to address economic challenges ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>Despite sweeping tariffs imposed on imported aluminum, domestic production in the U.S. has not revived due to high electricity costs.
