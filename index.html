          <p>Former President Donald Trump made an appearance at the U.S. Open in Queens, New York, where he watched a match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. This marked his first visit to the tennis tournament since before his presidency. While in attendance, Trump was seen waving to the crowd from a corporate suite and signing hats and other items for fans before his departure. His presence drew a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the spectators at Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>

          <p>Six people were killed and several others wounded after two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in north Jerusalem. The attack, which occurred at the Ramot Junction, was one of the deadliest in the city since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Israeli police reported that a security officer and a civilian neutralized the two assailants at the scene. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a "natural response" to Israeli actions, while Israeli leaders condemned the act of "barbarity."</p>

          <p>At least 13 people have died and dozens have been injured in Nepal following clashes between protesters and security forces in Kathmandu. The demonstrations, led by youth activists, were organized in opposition to a recent government ban on major social media platforms like Facebook and X. The government defends the ban as a necessary measure to regulate fake news and hate speech. However, protesters view it as an authoritarian move, leading to confrontations when they attempted to breach a restricted area near the parliament building.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market is experiencing a prolonged slump, shifting the power dynamic from sellers to buyers in many regions. A shortage of affordable homes and high mortgage rates have priced out many potential buyers, forcing sellers to lower their asking prices and offer concessions. While national median home prices have risen slightly, metro areas in the South and West are seeing price drops due to increased inventory from new construction. This trend provides more leverage for buyers but has not been enough to pull the market out of its rut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced his resignation after his ruling coalition lost its majority in both houses of parliament. His departure, coming less than a year into his term, triggers a leadership contest within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and raises concerns about political instability. Japan faces significant domestic challenges, including a cost of living crisis, and growing national security threats. Analysts predict a period of revolving prime ministers, while some see this as a potential opportunity for a national reset.</p>

          <p>England's cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has stated that the final lineup for the first Ashes Test against Australia has not yet been decided. The series, set to begin in Perth, has a few positions still in contention, notably the number three batting spot. Vice-captain Ollie Pope and 21-year-old Jacob Bethell are the main contenders for the role, with Bethell's recent strong performances in one-day internationals making a compelling case. McCullum emphasized that the team will be finalized upon their arrival in Australia, allowing players time to freshen up before the major series.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Donald Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense back to its original name, the "Department of War," is a truthful reflection of his administration's aggressive foreign policy. The author contends that despite its name, the department has long functioned as an instrument of war rather than defense, citing numerous undeclared wars and military interventions. The piece criticizes Trump's actions in Syria, Yemen, and Iran, and his proposed $1 trillion defense budget as evidence of a "warrior king" mentality that prioritizes military strength over peace and diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a stark divergence in union membership across the United States, based on state-level labor laws. States that protect collective bargaining rights have seen an increase in union members, while "right-to-work" states have experienced significant declines. According to the study, union density is nearly three times higher in states with pro-union laws, and workers in those states earn about 7% more on average. The findings highlight the impact of legislation on labor organization, with states like Illinois and Michigan seeing union growth after strengthening collective bargaining protections.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has unveiled a strategic plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The initiative aims to integrate AI into power grids and the coal, oil, and gas industries to enhance efficiency and innovation. By 2027, the government plans to establish a framework, develop at least five industry-specific AI models, and launch over 10 pilot projects.

          <p>While artificial intelligence is causing some disruption, labor economists argue its overall impact on the current job market remains relatively small, with economic uncertainty being a larger factor in recent slowdowns. Experts note that most AI-related job losses have been concentrated within the tech industry, which constitutes a small portion of the total U.S. workforce. Studies show that early-career workers in AI-exposed fields have seen employment declines, but there is also a growing demand for AI-related skills. Many employers may be more inclined to retrain existing workers to use AI tools rather than implement widespread layoffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party's National Executive Committee is meeting to establish the rules and timetable for a deputy leadership election after Angela Rayner resigned last week. Rayner's departure, following an admission of underpaying stamp duty, triggered a significant cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The contest is expected to be a pivotal moment for the party's direction, with high-profile figures like Dame Emily Thornberry considering a bid. The process will require candidates to secure substantial support from MPs and local party affiliates before facing a vote by the wider party membership.</p>

          <p>Private equity firms are aggressively recruiting fundraising and investor relations talent, sparking a "talent war" with Wall Street investment banks. After a period of slow dealmaking, firms are investing heavily in securing capital to prepare for a market rebound, and they are willing to pay a premium for skilled fundraisers. This hiring spree is a global phenomenon, with firms expanding in Asia, Europe, and North America. In response, major banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have implemented stricter rules to prevent their junior analysts from being poached by private equity firms years in advance.

          <p>DSRT Surf, a new surf destination located in Palm Desert, is scheduled to open in the summer of 2026, offering machine-powered waves over 100 miles from the ocean. The complex will feature a 5.5-acre surf pool within the Desert Willow Golf Resort, eventually including a hotel and luxury villas. The project addresses concerns about water usage by committing to replace a million square feet of golf course turf with native plants, which is projected to save more water than the surf park will consume annually. It will be the second inland surf resort in the Coachella Valley, aiming to make the sport accessible to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>California is currently experiencing a summer surge in COVID-19 cases, with rising test positivity rates and increased levels of the virus detected in wastewater across the state. However, the overall severity of the wave has been mild compared to previous years, with hospital admission rates remaining relatively low. While some data suggests the peak may be approaching, health officials remain cautious about the upcoming fall and winter seasons. The situation is complicated by ongoing confusion and new federal guidelines that could make it more difficult for some individuals under 65 to access the latest COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

          <p>California's FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, is reportedly continuing to deny homeowners' claims for smoke damage from recent wildfires, despite a court ruling and regulatory action against its policy. The insurer has been rejecting claims by requiring policyholders to show a "distinct, demonstrable and physical alteration" to their property, a high bar that leaves many without coverage for toxic smoke contamination. This practice has sparked numerous lawsuits and prompted Governor Newsom to call on the FAIR Plan to process claims fairly. The denials are creating significant financial hardship for homeowners forced to pay for remediation out of pocket.</p>

          <p>A recent whistleblower trial has brought to light serious allegations of mismanagement, overspending, and potential fraud in the cleanup operations following major California wildfires in 2018. A former state debris manager claimed that contractors overcharged the state by millions and that toxic contamination was sometimes left behind, but his concerns were dismissed by supervisors. While the whistleblower did not win his wrongful termination case, the trial revealed evidence from an audit that found poor oversight of contractors by state agencies. The case raises questions about the billion-dollar disaster recovery industry as climate change increases the frequency of such events.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Riefenstahl" by director Andres Veiel delves into the life and legacy of Leni Riefenstahl, the filmmaker celebrated for her work in Nazi Germany. Using materials from her personal archives, including correspondence and recordings, the film scrutinizes her claims of being a politically naive artist who was ignorant of the regime's atrocities. The documentary revisits evidence of her complicity, such as her presence at a massacre of Polish Jews and her use of Romani extras who were later murdered at Auschwitz. The film portrays her as a defiant figure who spent her life denying her role in Nazi propaganda.</p>
