          <p>Barry Hearn, promoter of the World Snooker Championship, is considering moving the tournament from its long-time home at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield after 2027.  The move is driven by a desire to increase revenue for players and explore greater opportunities.  While Sheffield is the preferred option, other locations in the UK, China, and Saudi Arabia are being considered.</p>
