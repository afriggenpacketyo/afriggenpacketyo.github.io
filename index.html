          <p>The article analyzes Donald Trump's actions, including a military parade and a partisan speech at Fort Bragg, as evidence of an attempt to politicize the US military.  Experts express concern about the erosion of the military's nonpartisan ethos and the potential implications for American democracy.  The author highlights the precedent of this action, citing a lack of similar instances in modern US history, and suggests that while the military is resisting, the situation constitutes a quiet crisis in civil-military relations. The article concludes by noting the lack of clarity on the military's response to such pressure.</p>
