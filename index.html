          <p>President Trump has announced plans to send federal troops to Portland, Oregon, to address what he terms "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities like the ICE building. This move has drawn sharp criticism from Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, who argue there is no need for military intervention and accuse the president of attempting to provoke conflict. The planned deployment is part of a broader strategy by the administration to use federal force in cities experiencing prolonged protests. The action has ignited a debate over federal authority and the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during the first Trump administration, strongly condemned the president's current approach to the Justice Department as "wholly unconstitutional" and "authoritarian." In an interview, Cobb stated that the department is now merely doing the president's bidding by targeting political enemies, abandoning the principle of even-handed justice. He views these actions as part of a broader effort by Trump to rewrite history regarding his past controversies, including the January 6th insurrection and the handling of classified documents. Cobb expressed deep concern over the pattern of politically motivated investigations and the erosion of judicial independence.</p>

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto moves through the Atlantic, meteorologists are observing a nearby developing system, now named Imelda, for a rare potential interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones move close enough to each other to begin orbiting a common center, which can sometimes result in them merging or altering each other's paths. While experts consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario due to the distance and strength difference between the storms, it remains a scientific possibility. Humberto is a powerful Category 5 storm, while Imelda is expected to bring heavy rain to the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially ended his bid for re-election, citing intense media speculation and the withholding of campaign funds as undermining his ability to run a viable campaign. His departure transforms the race into a three-way contest between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' term has been marked by a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration, which had directed prosecutors to dismiss a bribery case against him. Political rivals and city leaders have reacted to his withdrawal, highlighting the turbulent political landscape of the city.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a dangerous Category 5 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph. While not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, forecasters warn that its powerful swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Bermuda is being urged to monitor the hurricane's progress closely as it is expected to pass to its west.

          <p>The emcee for the Ryder Cup, comedian Heather McMahan, has stepped down after leading a profane chant against European golfer Rory McIlroy. The incident is part of a larger pattern of unruly fan behavior that has marred the event, with McIlroy and his wife facing significant heckling throughout the tournament. The disruptive conduct from some spectators has prompted criticism from Team Europe's captain and led to the ejection of two fans. In response to the escalating situation, additional New York State Troopers have been deployed to ensure player safety and maintain order for the remainder of the competition.</p>

          <p>Moldovans have voted in a critical parliamentary election that will determine the nation's geopolitical direction, choosing between closer ties with the European Union or aligning with Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of "massive interference" through disinformation and vote-buying schemes in an attempt to destabilize the country. The election sees her Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) in a tight race against the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. The outcome is highly anticipated, as it will significantly impact Moldova's future, especially given its strategic location between Ukraine and Romania and the ongoing war in the region.</p>

His comments come as Labour trails Reform in opinion polls, indicating potential challenges in upcoming local elections.

An attorney for the homeowners alleges that the issues stem from soil instability that the builder, PulteGroup, should have addressed during construction. This situation is not isolated, as the article highlights similar construction defect problems in other states like Florida and Texas, where expansive clay soils and poor building practices have led to widespread damage. The incidents underscore the risks buyers face even with new construction and the importance of independent inspections and understanding state-level consumer protection laws.</p>

          <p>The new film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, opened at the top of the box office with a domestic debut of $22.4 million. The adult drama, which also features Sean Penn and Regina Hall, performed within industry expectations and benefited from strong critical reviews and awards season buzz. The film's solid opening is another success for Warner Bros., which has had a string of box office hits this year, including "A Minecraft Movie" and "Sinners." This successful run has helped alleviate pressure on the studio after a period of underperforming films.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the U.S. due to a persistent neck injury. According to Ryder Cup rules, the match is declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development shifts the overall score to 12-5 in favor of Europe, meaning they now need only two and a half more points from the remaining 11 matches to win the tournament outright. Hovland's absence is a blow to Team Europe, but their substantial lead keeps them in a strong position to retain the cup.</p>

          <p>Denmark has issued a temporary nationwide ban on all civilian drone flights after a series of unauthorized drone sightings near military facilities and airports. The disruptions, which included a nearly four-hour closure of Copenhagen Airport, have been described by the government as part of a "hybrid attack." The ban will be in effect from Monday to Friday to ensure security as Denmark hosts an EU summit.

          <p>The poem "Syncretism" by Nina C. Peláez explores the complex relationship between a daughter and her father, who eschews traditional faith and therapy for the ritual of swimming. The speaker observes her father's quiet, almost devout-like preparation at the pool, connecting it to a deep, smoldering anger rooted in a childhood trauma involving a fire. This internal rage is depicted as a destructive force that periodically engulfs their family life, echoing the fire that reignited in his childhood home. Through this imagery, the poem delves into themes of inherited trauma, unspoken pain, and the difficult pursuit of forgiveness in the absence of conventional belief systems.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss citizens have narrowly voted in favor of a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system. The proposal passed with 50.4% of the vote, a much slimmer margin than polls had predicted. This new system, which will be state-controlled with data stored on users' smartphones, is a revised version of a plan that was rejected in 2021 over privacy concerns related to private sector involvement. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain wary of potential data misuse and the erosion of personal privacy.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a public health crisis as diabetes prevalence has nearly doubled over the past two decades, now affecting over 16% of the adult population—the highest rate in Europe. Health experts attribute this dramatic increase to lifestyle factors, particularly a diet high in carbohydrates and sugars, and a lack of physical activity. Critics blame inadequate government food policies, such as insufficient regulation of unhealthy products and the widespread use of starch-based sugars like corn syrup. With obesity rates also the highest in Europe, experts are calling for urgent, systemic changes including better medical care, early diagnosis, and promoting healthier nutrition, especially among children.</p>

In his speech, he condemned Israeli strikes, ruled out imminent normalization of relations, and called for the lifting of remaining international sanctions to aid Syria's recovery.

A local MP and chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee warned that further government intervention might be necessary and called the incident a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cybersecurity.
