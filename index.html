        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Canadian federal election brought considerable change, with 17% of seats switching parties, a significant increase from 7% in 2021. Several party leaders, including the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, lost their seats, while the Liberal Party experienced a turnaround. The shift saw all 59 flipped seats going to either the Liberals or Conservatives, with the NDP losing parliamentary funding and facing challenges to their party status. This article highlights a reshaping of the Canadian political landscape, accounting for population changes and resulting in losses for smaller parties.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its highest number of measles cases in a single year since 2019, with over 900 infections confirmed across at least 29 states, including a deadly outbreak in West Texas. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications, including hospitalization, brain swelling, and even death, particularly among unvaccinated individuals. Health officials attribute the rise in cases to declining vaccination rates, noting that only about 93% of kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles during the 2023-2024 school year, below the critical threshold of 95% needed for community immunity.</p>

It notes that top fixed annuities currently offer rates between 5.25% and 6.80%, and immediate annuities can offer payout rates between 6.5% and 10.5% for retirees in their mid-60s to mid-80s. The article advises considering factors beyond just the rate, including timeline, insurer, fees, surrender period, inflation, and overall retirement plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff loophole is set to increase costs for U.S. consumers, as it eliminates the duty-free entry of low-value packages, impacting retailers like Shein and Temu. With the end of the exemption, goods from China and other countries will no longer be low-priced, and importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. The change is expected to cause delays in shipments, diminish the variety of goods available, and potentially benefit companies selling goods made in the U.S.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump's first 100 days of his second presidency have been calamitous, marked by low approval ratings and troubling economic data. The author attributes the economic contraction to Trump's tariffs, which have led to increased imports and dented consumer confidence. The article also criticizes Trump's handling of foreign policy, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and suggests that his power to terrify is fading. The author concludes that nationalist populism, while effective in winning votes, is disastrous when translated into reality.</p>

The essay calls for a renewal of the contract that binds Americans and encourages individuals to take action, even if it means breaking unjust laws. The author suggests that Dr. King's example of peaceful protest and confrontation can inspire those who wish to fight back against injustice today.</p>
