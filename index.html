          <p>U.S. consumers are demonstrating robust spending on jewelry, providing a significant boost to brands like Pandora even as the company faces weaker sales in Europe and China. This trend persists despite potential economic headwinds from U.S. tariffs, which jewelry companies are partially absorbing to maintain market momentum. While analysts note the current strength of the American market, they also point to rising silver prices and new tariffs as potential challenges that could eventually impact consumer demand and company profit margins.</p>

          <p>California Republicans have strongly criticized Governor Gavin Newsom's new redistricting initiative, labeling it a 'sinister scheme' designed to undermine the state's independent commission and erode public trust. The criticism came after Newsom announced the plan with social media posts that mocked President Trump's online style, framing the move as a response to Trump's actions. Republican lawmakers argue the governor is executing a partisan power-grab to boost his national profile at the expense of California voters and the state's democratic processes.</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor saw its stock jump approximately 10% following the announcement of CEO Carrie Wheeler's resignation, a move that came after a significant pressure campaign from investors. Wheeler's departure follows a period of intense stock volatility and criticism from prominent figures, including a co-founder, who argued she lacked the support of the company's original leadership. The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO to navigate its challenging business model amid a tough real estate market.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) can proceed with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees, vacating a lower court's injunction that had blocked the move. The Trump administration initiated the massive reduction in force, aiming to leave only about 200 staff members at the agency created after the 2008 financial crisis. While the administration claims the goal is a more streamlined bureau, consumer advocates and the employees' union argue the cuts will cripple the CFPB's ability to perform its congressionally mandated duties.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. has filed a federal lawsuit to block the Trump administration's attempt to assume full control over the city's Metropolitan Police Department, an action the city's Attorney General called an unlawful power play. The conflict escalated after the U.S. Attorney General appointed a DEA official as an 'emergency police commissioner' with full authority, a move local officials argue violates D.C.'s Home Rule charter. Legal experts and city leaders have expressed grave concerns that the unprecedented move threatens public safety by creating command structure chaos and undermines democratic self-governance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled an emergency hearing to address the lawsuit filed by Washington, D.C., which challenges the Trump administration's unprecedented takeover of the city's police force. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb is seeking a temporary restraining order to pause a directive from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that installed a new federal official to lead the department. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions are an unconstitutional and 'brazenly unlawful' infringement on the District's right to self-governance, putting public safety at risk.</p>

          <p>A new Zillow analysis reveals that it is still possible to purchase a mansion, defined as a home with at least 5,000 square feet, for under $1 million in a few U.S. metropolitan areas. Cities like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Memphis offer these large properties at a median price below the seven-figure mark, a stark contrast to coastal markets where mansions can cost several million dollars. This affordability is often tied to older homes and is a remnant of a market where, just a few years ago, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued below $1 million.</p>

          <p>Two years after a catastrophic wildfire destroyed much of the historic town, the community of Lahaina, Maui, is still on a long and slow road to recovery. Over 100 people were killed in the 2023 blaze, and while the debris has been cleared, only about 50 of the thousands of destroyed homes have been rebuilt. Local officials are working to expedite permits and support residents, but the visible signs of progress are scattered, underscoring the immense challenge of rebuilding the community from the ashes.</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods, the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has announced an agreement to acquire its rival, Hovis, from private equity firm Endless. The proposed merger, which is subject to approval by the UK's competition watchdog, would create the largest bread producer in the country.

This novel approach enlists shoppers in crime prevention as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached a two-decade high.</p>

The closure will result in immediate redundancies and has been criticized by unions as a failure of the government's green energy strategy and a blow to UK jobs.</p>

While the EU officially recognizes Beijing, this shift is occurring alongside Brussels' broader strategy to 'de-risk' from mainland China. This evolving diplomatic landscape is seen by Beijing as a challenge to a major diplomatic red line and a test of the EU's strategic autonomy amid the intensifying rivalry between the U.S. and China.</p>
