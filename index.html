          <p>A Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, who was arrested for allegedly shielding an illegal immigrant from ICE, had posted a notice on her courtroom door advising individuals feeling unsafe to request Zoom appearances. Dugan is accused of helping Eduardo Flores-Ruiz evade ICE agents after his court appearance on misdemeanor battery charges. The notice, dated April 14, was posted four days before the alleged incident, raising questions about the judge's motivations and potential obstruction of justice. Dugan has been charged with obstruction of an official proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent discovery and arrest.</p>

          <p>Two employees from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have reportedly gained access to classified networks containing sensitive information about America's nuclear weapons.

          <p>Apollo Global Management predicts that the economic impact of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will lead to a recession this summer. The firm anticipates empty shelves in U.S. stores due to slowed containership departures from China, followed by trucking layoffs and reduced sales. While some tariffs have been paused, increased duties on China are expected to disrupt the economy. The timeline suggests that U.S. consumers could start noticing trade-related shortages as early as next month.</p>
