          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, an anti-Israel activist and Columbia University graduate student, was released on bail from an immigration detention center following a judge's order, allowing him to return to his family in New York. The judge cited that Khalil was not a flight risk or a danger to the community, and deemed his imprisonment an "exceedingly rare" decision by the government. Khalil was arrested in March at Columbia for his pro-Palestinian activism, leading to an immigration judge ruling for his removal based on a memo citing his protests being at odds with U.S. foreign policy interests. Khalil's case has become a focal point for anti-Israel protesters and immigration rights advocates, who argue the Trump administration is retaliating against him for his views. The Trump administration is appealing the preliminary injunction and Khalil's release.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 21:31:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough and suggested he might fire him. Despite previous statements indicating no intention to remove Powell, Trump expressed frustration over the Fed's cautious approach to rate cuts, which aims to balance economic growth with inflation control. Any attempt to fire Powell would likely face legal challenges, as federal law allows the removal of Fed governors only "for cause". Powell has previously stated he would not resign if asked by Trump, and the two met at the White House last month to discuss the economy. The Fed's decisions come with tradeoffs as high interest rates can slow economic growth, while lowering them too rapidly could cause inflation to spike. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent videos circulating on Chinese social media have sparked a renewed debate about moral values concerning elderly individuals on public transportation. In one incident, an elderly woman was criticized by young passengers for asking for a courtesy seat on a subway, while another involved an 83-year-old man who was refused a seat on a train. These incidents have ignited discussions about the erosion of traditional values such as sympathy and respect for elders in China's increasingly individualistic society. The subway authority in Shanghai has offered little guidance on how to avoid similar situations in the future, leading to further discussion about the balance between individual needs and societal expectations.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests during a visit to Los Angeles. Vance also misidentified Senator Alex Padilla as "Jose Padilla," following an incident where the senator was detained at a press conference on immigration raids. Vance blamed Newsom and Bass for treating Los Angeles as a sanctuary city, which he claimed encouraged violence against federal law enforcement. Newsom's spokesperson refuted Vance's claims, and Newsom himself responded to the misidentification of Padilla, suggesting it was intentional, referencing the name of a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter. The vice president's visit highlights the Trump administration's focus on hard-line immigration policies amid ongoing tensions in the city.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to meet with federal law enforcement and stated that the Trump administration believes the National Guard deployment is still necessary due to potential protest flare-ups. Vance accused Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass of encouraging violence during protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. He also referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "JosÃ© Padilla," which Newsom suggested was intentional, referencing a convicted al-Qaeda terrorist. Federal immigration officers have increased enforcement efforts, with ICE aiming for 3,000 arrests daily, although the current average is around 1,200. The friction in Los Angeles began earlier this month, and the deployment of troops has drawn criticism from state and local officials.</p>

          <p>Iran has stated it will not resume talks regarding its nuclear program while under attack, following warnings from Israel's defense minister about a "prolonged" conflict. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, where he was urged to revive diplomatic efforts with the U.S. regarding the nuclear program. Araghchi insisted that Iran's nuclear program was peaceful and that Israel's attacks violated international law, asserting Iran's right to self-defense. President Trump indicated Iran had a two-week window to avoid potential U.S. air strikes, while the U.S. ambassador to the UN accused Iran of having a "genocidal agenda".</p>

          <p>The United States has faced difficulties in securing trade deals, failing to reach an agreement with Japan and threatening new duties on imports from multiple countries. Analysts suggest that these developments may embolden China to adopt a tougher stance in trade negotiations with Washington. President Trump previously raised duties on Chinese imports, but these were put on hold pending trade negotiations. Chen Zhiwu, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, believes the U.S. threats and lack of a deal with Japan indicate desperation, potentially strengthening China's negotiating position. These factors suggest a shift in the balance of power in ongoing trade discussions.</p>

These plants are responsible for a significant portion of Michigan's greenhouse gas emissions.

NATO members are expected to discuss defense and security at a summit next week, with a formal pledge to spend 5% of GDP on defense potentially being formalized.

          <p>A popular new title on the Roblox gaming platform, Grow a Garden, has attracted millions of players, surpassing even Fortnite in concurrent users. The game involves players cultivating a virtual garden, buying seeds, and selling their harvest, with gameplay continuing even when offline. Its slow pace and competitive elements appeal to many, particularly children, while some critics are puzzled by its popularity. Players can use Robux, the Roblox currency, to speed up gameplay, and some sought-after items are being sold for high prices on eBay, indicating the game's significant impact on the online gaming community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer approaches, the debate over whether it's appropriate to wear shorts in the office persists, despite many companies relaxing their dress codes. Stylists agree that the appropriateness of shorts depends on the context, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than casual options like beach or sports shorts. Many companies now expect employees to dress professionally and comfortably, trusting them to make appropriate decisions. However, some companies still consider shorts too casual for client-facing roles, while others, particularly in creative industries, embrace more relaxed attire. The perception of shorts may also differ between men and women, with some men feeling less comfortable wearing them outside of vacation settings.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within a two-week window set by President Trump, who is considering U.S. involvement in Israel's offensive. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva amidst ongoing Israeli airstrikes and U.S. military buildup. While Araghchi expressed Iran's readiness to consider diplomacy, he emphasized that Iran's defense capabilities are non-negotiable. The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program in exchange for halting uranium enrichment, but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not responded, potentially due to health issues and concerns about Israeli strikes. Turkey, Oman, and European countries have offered to host direct or indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran, and the coming days will be crucial in determining whether a diplomatic breakthrough is possible.</p>

American Oversight, a government watchdog, filed the lawsuit after officials discussed military operations on Signal, alleging violations of federal records law. The judge ruled that the group failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of the agencies' recordkeeping programs or the court's ability to recover already-deleted messages.

          <p>Romance and fantasy books are experiencing a surge in popularity, pushing UK fiction revenue above Â£1 billion, with romantasy leading the charge. Romantasy, a blend of romance and fantasy, has gained a significant following on TikTok's BookTok community, driven by series like Fourth Wing and A Court of Thorns and Roses. Readers are drawn to tropes such as "enemies to lovers" and "second-chance romance," as well as the "spice level" of the books, which often focuses on female pleasure and emotional connection. Despite the commercial success, some industry experts believe sexism continues to prevent the genre from gaining mainstream recognition, though attitudes are slowly changing as more people openly share their love of romance novels online.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to be heavily influenced by President Trump's demands for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to secure a commitment to higher defense spending, but divisions remain between Trump and European allies on trade, Russia, and the Middle East conflict. Trump has consistently criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense, and the summit's discussions will be condensed to accommodate his preferences. While some European nations are increasing their defense spending, many will struggle to meet the new targets, leading to potential compromises and creative accounting.</p>

Despite Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrapping up talks with European counterparts, Trump stated that Iran only wants to speak with the U.S., but also rebuffed a standing offer from the U.S. to resume nuclear negotiations. Trump has also expressed distrust for his own intelligence community, contradicting the assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. As diplomacy stalls, analysts warn that Iran could use the talks to buy time or advance its nuclear program, while the security of Americans in the Middle East remains at risk.</p>
