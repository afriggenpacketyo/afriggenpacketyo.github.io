          <p>Liverpool Football Club is reportedly advancing its negotiations to acquire Crystal Palace and England defender Marc Guehi. With only one year remaining on his contract, Palace is believed to be seeking around £40 million to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. The club has reportedly already held initial discussions for the 25-year-old center-back, who is seen as a key target for their summer transfer window. Liverpool is also pursuing younger talent, such as Parma's Giovanni Leoni, as a long-term prospect.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, threatening to permit a "major lawsuit" against him. The threat, posted on social media, centers on the management and cost of renovations at the Fed's headquarters, which Trump claims are excessively expensive. This move is viewed as another attempt to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates, a frequent demand from the former president. Trump also criticized his former Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, for recommending Powell for the position.</p>

Despite facing challenges such as a recent decline in net income attributed to tariffs on Chinese goods, E.l.f. remains focused on its long-term growth strategy. The company has achieved 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, driven by its popularity with younger consumers and effective social media marketing.

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Significant Hidden Costs Associated with Medicaid Cuts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent legislation is set to reduce federal support for Medicaid, potentially causing 10 million Americans to lose health insurance. This article analyzes the cascading financial consequences, arguing that the costs will shift rather than disappear. Uninsured individuals often turn to federally qualified health centers and hospital emergency rooms, placing immense financial strain on these institutions, which act as insurers of last resort. This leads to higher uncompensated care costs for hospitals, increased medical debt for patients, and ultimately, a less healthy and productive workforce, creating broader economic burdens.

          <p>The number of migrants arriving in the UK via small boats across the English Channel has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power last summer. This milestone has intensified the political debate over border control, with the Conservative opposition criticizing the government's failure to stop the crossings. The report comes as French authorities confirmed a woman died while attempting the journey. The government maintains it is implementing measures to address the issue, including a new returns agreement with France, but faces significant pressure over the rising numbers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) increased by 2.7% in the 12 months ending in July, a figure slightly cooler than the 2.8% anticipated by economists. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs, while energy prices fell. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, saw its largest monthly increase since January, reaching 3.1% annually. The data suggests that while the impact of tariffs is beginning to appear in some categories, it has not yet caused a major inflation surge. (not investment advice)</p>

The current economic environment of low unemployment and persistent inflation is expected to keep borrowing costs elevated.

          <p>For retirees who must take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but don't need the cash, financial planners suggest several strategic options. Instead of simply spending the money, retirees can reinvest it into a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular strategy is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a charity that also satisfies the RMD. Additionally, the funds can be used for legacy planning, such as contributing to a 529 college savings plan for grandchildren. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI firm Anthropic has announced it will provide its Claude for Enterprise and Government models to all three branches of the U.S. government for just $1 per agency for an entire year. The move highlights the intense competition among leading AI companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to secure lucrative and influential government contracts. This follows a similar offer from competitor OpenAI and comes as the Department of Defense has already awarded development contracts to several major AI players, signaling a race to integrate AI into government operations.</p>

The story traces her connection to the conspiracy, which began on a dating app and was rooted in a family feud in Birmingham. Betro flew to the UK to kill a man, but the attempt failed when her gun jammed at point-blank range.
