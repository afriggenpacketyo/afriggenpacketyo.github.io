          <p>A small plane crashed shortly after takeoff from London Southend Airport, resulting in the deaths of all four people aboard, who are believed to be foreign nationals. The aircraft, a Beech B200 Super King operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, was en route to the Netherlands when witnesses saw it invert and crash, causing a "fireball" explosion. The airport has been closed as the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and police investigate the cause of the tragic incident. The crash has prompted a significant air exclusion zone around the site.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko to become the country's new prime minister, aiming to significantly renew the government's work amid the ongoing war with Russia. Svyrydenko, 39, is credited with successfully negotiating a key mineral deal with the United States and has risen quickly through government ranks. Her appointment, which requires parliamentary approval, would make her the second female prime minister in Ukraine's history. The move is part of a broader cabinet reshuffle as Zelenskyy seeks to strengthen Ukraine's leadership.</p>

Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and smoke, rescuing over a dozen people via ladders, though five firefighters sustained minor injuries. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire in the three-story building, which was equipped with sprinklers but had smoke damage throughout. Governor Maura Healey praised the heroic efforts of first responders, which prevented a greater loss of life.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a 50-day ultimatum, threatening to impose 100% secondary tariffs on any country conducting business with Russia if a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine is not reached. The announcement reflects growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a strategy to use trade as leverage to settle the conflict. In a related development, Trump revealed a deal where NATO allies will purchase U.S.-manufactured weapons to send to Ukraine, with European nations footing the bill. This marks a significant escalation in economic pressure aimed at isolating Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

Pneumonic plague can be spread between humans through airborne droplets, unlike the more common bubonic form, though such transmission is rare.

          <p>The U.S. plan to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine represents a significant boost to the country's air defense capabilities against Russian attacks. The Patriot, a mobile surface-to-air system, is effective at intercepting threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft over a range of about 68 kilometers. The deal, facilitated by Germany and paid for by European allies, provides Ukraine with a sophisticated weapon it has previously used. While highly capable, the system requires about 90 troops to operate and is less effective against smaller, low-flying drones.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, will upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This move is aimed at making electric vehicles more affordable, as LFP batteries are significantly cheaper to produce because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. GM states this will help diversify its EV portfolio, which currently spans a wide range of price points. Commercial production of the new, lower-cost battery cells is expected to begin by late 2027.</p>

          <p>Customs officials at Germany's Cologne Bonn airport made a startling discovery, finding approximately 1,500 young tarantulas hidden inside plastic containers within sponge cake boxes. The package, which arrived from Vietnam, was inspected after officials noticed a suspicious smell that was inconsistent with baked goods.

However, the FAA clarified that it does not consider the issue an "unsafe condition" that would warrant a mandatory directive, as the design includes multiple safety features.</p>

A local official described the immense power of the flood, which reached a height of 36 feet in one community.

          <p>The 2025 Club World Cup final, in which Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain, has drawn criticism for the prominent role of politicians in the post-match celebrations. The article argues that Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino placed themselves "front and centre" during the trophy presentation, hijacking the moment from the victorious athletes. This act is presented as a "grimly perfect image" of a misguided tournament, where football seemed secondary to political grandstanding. While the match itself was a tactical triumph for Chelsea, the event's legacy may be defined by this politicization.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements surged by 60% in June compared to the previous year, reaching their highest level in over a decade. This significant increase may be an early sign that Beijing is relaxing its stringent export controls, potentially as a result of recent behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States on the flow of critical minerals. The move follows reports that China had issued six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers.

This skepticism has undermined herd immunity, a collective protection that relies on high vaccination rates.
