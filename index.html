          <p>The United States Air Force has released additional information regarding its sixth-generation fighter, the F-47, and its collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones, intensifying competition with China for air superiority. The F-47 will have a combat radius exceeding 1,000 nautical miles, surpassing the F-22 Raptor, while the CCA drones will have a range of over 700 nautical miles. These developments are crucial for operations in the Indo-Pacific region, as China continues to advance its own sixth-generation fighter program. The F-47 and its drones are expected to be critical for operations across the Indo-Pacific region, according to defence experts and previous US Air Force statements.</p>

The meeting signifies a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, aiming to stabilize the country after years of civil war and violence. Al-Sharaa expressed hope that Syria would facilitate trade between east and west, inviting American companies to invest in Syrian oil and gas.</p>

          <p>China's tech hub, Shenzhen, has seen a significant increase in foreign visitors this year, driven by the expansion of visa-free entry policies and integration within the Greater Bay Area. The city's international airport reported over 152,000 visa-free entries by foreign nationals in 2025, a 160.3% year-on-year increase. To accommodate the growing demand, new international routes have been added to cities such as Dubai, Vientiane, Osaka, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Hanoi. Shenzhen's appeal lies in its status as a trade and manufacturing center, proximity to Hong Kong, and relatively lower cost of living.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise in volatile trading after announcing a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion).

The ruling allows the Trump administration to deport individuals who meet specific criteria, including being at least 14 years old, lacking legal immigration status, and being members of the gang. However, the judge also ordered the administration to provide at least 21 days' notice to those facing deportation and an opportunity to object.

          <p>US President Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs and skepticism towards wind energy, are affecting the renewable energy sector. While clean energy has grown significantly in recent years, Trump's administration has attempted to halt funding for green energy projects and proposed tariffs that could impact the industry. These measures inject uncertainty into the future of clean tech in the United States, potentially slowing the pace of growth despite incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite the challenges, experts predict the sector will continue to expand, albeit at a slower rate.</p>

While a spokesman for Mr. Witkoff denied on Tuesday that the proposal had come up in the talks, Iran's proposal entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, according to the four Iranian officials and news reports.</p>
