          <p>During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump publicly pushed a fringe conspiracy theory about white South Africans being killed. Trump presented Ramaphosa with a video and news articles that he claimed showed evidence of mass killings of white farmers, despite police statistics showing that white people are not more vulnerable to violent crime in South Africa. Ramaphosa attempted to correct the record, emphasizing that Black people are the majority of victims of violent crime in South Africa, but Trump remained unconvinced. The incident has been criticized as racist propaganda, with the president of the N.A.A.C.P. calling it a sickening display. </p>

          <p>House Republicans have released an updated version of their massive bill, aiming to advance much of President Trump's domestic agenda, including extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, providing tax relief for overtime and car loan interest (for U.S.-made cars), increasing the child tax credit, and raising the standard deduction. The bill also addresses the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, raising it to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000. Additionally, it proposes changes to Medicaid and SNAP, including work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, and seeks to lift the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. This sweeping legislation faces challenges in the Senate and is expected to receive unified opposition from Democrats. </p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the "sell U.S." narrative strengthens, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has highlighted emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 8.55% year-to-date, compared to a 1% climb by the S&P 500, reflecting a growing confidence in emerging markets assets.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration continues to be a contentious issue in UK politics, with successive governments struggling to assuage public concerns. Despite expected falls in net migration, Prime Minister Starmer's Labour government is the latest to attempt to address the issue through visa rule overhauls. The article explores how attitudes to immigration have shaped British politics, leading to a realignment of voters based on identity politics and anti-elite sentiment. While attitudes to immigration may be softening, concerns persist about the impact on public services and competition for jobs. </p>

          <p>Columbia University's commencement ceremony was met with boos from graduates protesting campus lockdowns, arrests at pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and a revolving door of university presidents. Acting President Claire Shipman was jeered during her remarks, with graduates expressing anger over the university's handling of recent events. Amid a clampdown by the Trump administration on international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, Ms. Shipman spoke in favor of the rights of those students, saying, “We firmly believe that our international students have the same rights to free speech as everyone else.” Protests continued outside the gates, with former students burning their diplomas. </p>

          <p>The Senate is set to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats call "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government, including a rule to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, but Democrats contend such a vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. California officials are prepared for a legal fight if the waivers are revoked. </p>

The heatwave, most intense off the west coast of Ireland, could impact marine life, potentially disrupting breeding patterns and causing algae blooms.

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting the latter sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. Under the terms of the deal Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. Sir Keir Starmer is due to sign a deal handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius on Thursday. </p>
