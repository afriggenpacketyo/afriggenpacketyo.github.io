          <p>Senate Republicans passed a budget framework supporting President Trump's agenda after a series of amendment votes. The framework raises the debt ceiling and makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent, sparking debate over budgetary tactics. Some conservatives have expressed concerns about using a 'current policy baseline' to mask the true cost of the tax cuts, labeling it a gimmick. The budget reconciliation process lowers the Senate vote threshold, allowing Republicans to approve priorities without Democratic support, which Democrats criticized as a missed opportunity to address issues like tariffs and minimum wage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping overhaul of US trade policy has triggered widespread alarm, with the announcement of tariffs on trading partners leading to stock market declines. Trump defends the move as a return to policies he has advocated for decades, aiming to revitalize the US economy and generate revenue. However, economists and businesses warn of potential negative consequences, including increased costs for consumers. The tariffs, ranging from 10% to 50%, represent a significant shift from the era of globalization and mutually agreed trade rates.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a vaccine booster capable of amplifying immune responses against cancer and viruses by up to 150-fold. The system, named SABER, acts as a molecular 'elevator,' bypassing cellular barriers to transport antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, enhancing treatment for malignancies and improving vaccine effectiveness. This innovative approach aims to improve the delivery of vaccine antigens to CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for immune defenses. The research, conducted by scientists from multiple universities, was published in the journal Nature.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on foreign countries, particularly those in Asia, could potentially raise the price of Nike's iconic Air Jordan 1 sneakers. The company's shares fell after the tariff announcement due to concerns about the impact on its supply chain. Analysts suggest that Nike may have to increase prices to offset the higher import taxes, but it's unclear how much of the cost increase will be passed on to consumers. Nike relies heavily on US consumers, making the market sentiment a significant concern.</p>

          <p>The Peace Corps is the latest federal agency to be targeted by Elon Musk's unofficial 'department of government efficiency'. 'Doge' could be eyeing cuts to the agency, which sends US volunteers around the world to work in local communities on health, education and environmental initiatives. Obtaining access to the agency's financial records indicates it could be looking to cut costs and cancel programs as it has done with other agencies that work on global issues and foreign aid, such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
