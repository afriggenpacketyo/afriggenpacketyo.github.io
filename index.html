          <p>A Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House is facing scrutiny from Wall Street due to projections that its tax breaks will significantly outstrip savings, potentially increasing U.S. debt. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the bill's potential to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill includes renewing President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets. While the Trump administration disagrees, critics argue the bill's spending cuts aren't sufficient to offset the tax breaks, potentially squeezing federal spending and impacting programs like Social Security.

The 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023. The downgrade reflects concerns that the U.S. deficit will continue to rise due to increasing entitlement spending and relatively flat government revenue.

          <p>A Microsoft employee based outside the U.S. questioned the job security norms in the U.S., asking how people can live comfortably knowing they can be fired at any time. American workers responded by describing a system that creates constant stress, fear, and a lack of trust in employers. While laws against discriminatory or retaliatory firings exist, they are difficult to prove and fight. Coping strategies include keeping emergency savings, building hard-to-replace skill sets, and maintaining an updated resume.</p>

          <p>A new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, titled "Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again," alleges that President Biden's advisors and family went to great lengths to hide his physical and cognitive decline. This comes after Joe Biden announced he has stage four metastatic prostate cancer.

Despite Trump's claims of immediate ceasefire negotiations, Putin's statements suggested a continuation of stalling tactics.

While Trump's potential withdrawal from peace talks could open the door for renewed sanctions or other nations to intensify pressure on Putin, Trump's apparent fear of angering Putin remains a significant obstacle.</p>
