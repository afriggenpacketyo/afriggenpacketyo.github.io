          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport has been experiencing major delays and cancellations due to a combination of air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and ongoing runway construction. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, with some flights delayed by up to six hours. A shortage of air traffic controllers in Philadelphia, which oversees Newark's airspace, has been a significant factor, along with controllers taking trauma leave after equipment outages. The situation has led to calls for investigation and a revamp of the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. The proposal aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations with more attractive incentives. Senator Adam Schiff also indicated his office was working on a similar federal film incentive proposal. The move follows industry concerns that tariffs could harm Hollywood more than help it, as cheaper labor and tax credits have lured productions away.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun sending grant terminations to arts organizations following President Trump's proposed budget, which calls for shutting down the agency. The NEA is updating its grant policies to prioritize projects that reflect the nation's artistic heritage and creativity, as prioritized by the President. The agency will focus funding on projects that elevate HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, and foster AI competency, among other priorities.</p>

          <p>The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company is progressing towards becoming an official city named Starbase. Voters, primarily Musk's employees, approved the formal organization of Starbase as a city. This move has drawn both support for job creation and concerns about Musk's increased control over the area, including potential authority to close a popular beach for launches. The creation of an official company town has drawn critics who worry it will expand Musk's personal control over the area.</p>
