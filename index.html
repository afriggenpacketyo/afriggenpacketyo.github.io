        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" following unannounced inspections by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The downgrade comes after concerns raised by staff and patients regarding the quality of care and staffing levels. The CQC found breaches relating to risk management, safe environment, learning from incidents, infection prevention and control, medicines management, and staffing. Several families have reported inadequate care, including avoidable injury or death of babies, prompting calls for an independent review of the trust's maternity services, while the trust has committed to improving its services. The current situation raises serious questions about the oversight and accountability within the healthcare system. </p>

          <p>A Monrovia, California resident shared security footage of a black bear roaming her backyard before entering her home.

The homeowner woke up to find the bear in her kitchen, just ten feet from her bed.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate reached 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates. The figure exceeded economists' expectations and is above the BOJ's 2% target for the 38th consecutive month. The BOJ has held rates at 0.5% but indicated it would continue to raise rates once it has more conviction that underlying inflation will approach 2%. Japan's GDP also shrank 0.2% in the quarter ended March, marking the first contraction in a year (not investment advice).</p>

The JCPOA, signed in 2015, imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump withdrew the U.S. in 2018, arguing the deal was defective and did not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time and the U.S. has imposed new sanctions. The future of negotiations remains uncertain amid ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

Local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 have reduced the share of plastic bags collected during shoreline cleanups by as much as 47%. Fee-based policies appear to be more effective than full bans, while partial bans are the least effective. The study also suggests that plastic bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a reduction in entangled animals observed in areas with such policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied R. Kelly's request to be placed on home detention, citing a lack of jurisdiction to rule on claims of a prison murder plot. Kelly's attorneys had filed an emergency motion seeking his release, alleging his life was in danger due to a conspiracy involving prison officials. The judge noted that since Kelly has already been convicted and sentenced, her jurisdiction is limited. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for sex crimes.</p>

          <h2>Why Israel Might Target Iran's Underground Fordo Nuclear Facility</h2>

          <p>This article examines why Israel might target Iran's underground Fordo nuclear facility, which is believed to house clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Fordo is buried deep within a mountain and is considered the most likely location for a potential nuclear weapons "breakout" program. Experts believe that Israel's best chance at destroying the facility would be with a U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bomb. The lack of transparency surrounding Iran's work at Fordo has long been a concern, especially since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal.</p>
