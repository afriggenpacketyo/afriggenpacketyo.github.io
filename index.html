        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This increase is largely attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability and stimulated buyer activity. Despite the rise in sales volume and a slight increase in inventory, the median home price continued to climb, marking the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. The market remains competitive, with tight supply continuing to exert upward pressure on prices, which are now 53% higher than pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government faces another shutdown, a look back reveals 14 such funding lapses since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations without appropriations. Before this, agencies often continued to operate, assuming Congress would quickly provide funding. The frequency of shutdowns has increased over the past decade, with notable events including the 21-day lapse under President Clinton in 1995 and the record 35-day shutdown under President Trump in 2018. These events have become a recurring feature of political standoffs in Washington, often resulting in significant economic costs and disruptions to federal services.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier in connection with sprawling illegal gambling operations tied to Mafia crime families. The charges stem from two separate but related schemes involving rigged high-stakes poker games and prop betting on NBA games. Billups is implicated in the poker operation, which allegedly used sophisticated technology to cheat players out of millions, while Rozier is accused of providing inside information for betting purposes. The nationwide takedown involved 34 defendants, including current and former NBA figures and members of the Bonano, Gambino, and Genovese families.</p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg, have been dismissed for gross misconduct following an undercover investigation by BBC Panorama. A disciplinary panel upheld allegations against Neilson for making highly racist and discriminatory remarks, including suggesting violence against migrants. Borg was found to have reveled in the use of force on detainees and made discriminatory comments about Muslims. Both officers claimed they were goaded by the undercover reporter, but the panel ruled their conduct was an "utter disgrace" that caused significant harm to public confidence in policing.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown will force active-duty military service members and essential civilian defense personnel to continue working without pay until a funding agreement is reached. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown ends, military pay requires a separate act of Congress to be disbursed on time. A bill to ensure troops get paid during the shutdown did not pass in time, leaving many military families facing financial uncertainty. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering 0% APR loans to affected service members to help mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients will continue to receive their monthly benefit checks during the U.S. government shutdown, as the payments are covered by mandatory spending and are not subject to annual appropriation battles. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, which will lead to disruptions in other services. With nearly 90% of its workforce deemed essential, the agency will continue processing payments but will halt services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards. The shutdown could also delay the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) announcement, which is based on inflation data that may not be released on schedule.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation before the fiscal year begins on October 1, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential functions. Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to operate, but employees in these roles work without pay until funding is restored. Programs with permanent funding, like Social Security and Medicare, continue to pay benefits, though administrative services may be curtailed. The economic impact can be substantial, as the 2018-2019 shutdown cost the economy an estimated $11 billion, with $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia have subpoenaed high-ranking Trump administration officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, to testify in a hearing over alleged vindictive prosecution. The defense argues that the criminal case against Abrego Garcia was initiated in retaliation after he was wrongfully deported and then ordered back to the U.S. by a federal judge. U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw has already ruled there is a "realistic likelihood" of vindictiveness, citing public remarks from Blanche as potential direct evidence.

          <p>The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached during an ongoing government shutdown that is expected to exacerbate the nation's fiscal challenges. Government shutdowns contribute to rising debt by disrupting economic activity, delaying revenue collection, and increasing costs associated with pausing and restarting federal programs. The debt has accelerated rapidly, growing from $37 trillion just two months ago, raising concerns among fiscal policy experts about rising interest costs and potential damage to investor confidence. The growing debt burden could also fuel inflation, eroding the purchasing power of consumers over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that with Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remaining attractive, now may be a strategic time to lock in yields before the Federal Reserve potentially lowers rates further. Planners typically recommend allocating 10% to 30% of cash savings to CDs, depending on an individual's financial goals, emergency fund status, and liquidity needs. CDs are best suited for short- to medium-term goals with a clear timeline, as early withdrawals incur penalties. It is crucial to first establish a robust emergency fund of three to six months of living expenses in a more accessible account before committing money to a CD. (not investment advice)</p>

He has been held in a maximum-security prison for over three months without charge as part of the Trump administration's controversial third-country deportation program. His lawyer states his life is at risk and he is being denied due process and access to legal counsel. The program sends deportees convicted of serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault, to African nations that have agreed to accept them, a practice heavily criticized by human rights groups.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has drawn widespread criticism for comments linking migration to a perceived lack of safety in public spaces, particularly for women and girls. While discussing his government's efforts to increase deportations, Merz referred to a "problem in the cityscape," which critics have condemned as racist rhetoric that echoes the far-right. Merz has defended his remarks, claiming many people feel afraid in public due to migrants who do not abide by German rules. The comments have sparked protests and a petition signed by nearly 200,000 people, who accuse the chancellor of manipulating safety concerns to justify discriminatory policies.</p>

          <p>England has won its T20 cricket series against New Zealand 1-0 after the third and final match in Auckland was abandoned due to persistent rain, with only 3.4 overs played. This follows the first match also being heavily impacted by weather, leaving England's dominant 65-run victory in the second game as the decisive result of the series. Captain Harry Brook stated the tour was still "very worthwhile," emphasizing the benefits of team bonding activities off the field. The series win is Brook's first overseas victory as England's white-ball captain ahead of the T20 World Cup in February.</p>

          <p>Recent deadly protests in Ladakh, a strategic Himalayan region bordering China and Pakistan, have highlighted simmering local anger over unfulfilled promises of autonomy from India's central government. Residents are demanding statehood, job quotas, and special status to protect their land and culture, which they feel are threatened following the region's administrative reorganization in 2019. The protests turned violent, resulting in four deaths and dozens of arrests, with locals now feeling unfairly labeled as "anti-national."

Global benchmark Brent crude rose to $65.74 per barrel, while U.S. crude reached $61.63 per barrel. The sanctions are intended to cripple the Kremlin's ability to fund its war effort and come after a planned summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin was canceled due to a lack of progress.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have used export controls and strategic investments to control the hardware building blocks of AI, citing national security concerns and competition with China. This strategy represents a deliberate choice to regulate the core of AI technology with an "iron grip" while maintaining a "light touch" on its more visible surface applications.</p>

While the COLA provides essential inflation protection, many retirees feel the projected increase of about $54 to the average monthly check is insufficient to cover rising costs for healthcare, housing, and food. The annual adjustment is tied to inflation rates, which have moderated since the post-pandemic spike that led to a record 8.7% COLA in 2023.

This creates a de facto buffer zone, with Israel's defense minister warning that anyone crossing the line will be met with fire.

          <p>Kelly Reichardt's latest film, "The Mastermind," is an ironic and humorous character study disguised as a heist movie. The film follows J. B. Mooney, an unemployed carpenter who masterminds a clumsy, ill-conceived plan to steal paintings from a local museum. Rather than focusing on the thrill of the crime, the movie methodically explores the aftermath as J. B.'s life unravels due to his own selfish and shortsighted actions. Actor Josh O'Connor delivers an understated performance, capturing the hangdog charisma of a man whose middle-class entitlement leaves him incapable of considering consequences. The film serves as a precise exploration of hubris as a self-destructive force.</p>
