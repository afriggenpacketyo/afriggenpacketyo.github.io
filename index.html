With Hong Kong leading the world in IPOs and India's stock exchanges ranking among the top globally, HSBC aims to better serve its wealth management clients and tap into the burgeoning opportunities in these dynamic markets.

          <p>Protests against federal immigration sweeps in downtown Los Angeles intensified, leading to demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway. In response, the Trump administration deployed the California National Guard to address what it described as "lawlessness" in the state, following clashes between demonstrators and authorities. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move as "purposefully inflammatory" and warned that it would escalate tensions, calling for the administration to rescind the order. The situation remains tense as federal and state authorities clash over control of the National Guard and the handling of immigration enforcement operations.

          <p>President Trump announced a new travel ban restricting citizens from 19 countries from entering the US, citing national security concerns and going into effect at midnight ET. The proclamation affects millions seeking relocation, travel, work, or education in the US, with total bans for countries like Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Iran, and partial restrictions for others. The reasons for inclusion vary, ranging from lack of reliable document-issuing authorities to high rates of visa overstays and terrorist activity. This ban differs from the 2017 ban by being broader and including Haiti, while also raising concerns about restrictions on Afghans who supported US troops. The new policy will be reviewed every 180 days for potential modifications. </p>

While one veteran experienced a decline in mental health, eight others reported improved symptoms and called the experience "life-changing". The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, with promising early results.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK energy market is considering a radical shift to regional pricing to address rising energy bills and grid constraints that force renewable energy firms to be paid to not provide power. The current system, designed for coal and gas plants, struggles to accommodate the influx of renewable energy from remote areas, leading to compensation payments for turned-down output. The proposed change aims to create smaller regional markets, potentially lowering bills in areas with abundant renewable resources like Scotland. However, the move has sparked intense debate, with concerns about investment uncertainty and potential cost increases in other regions. The change would require the government to make a decision soon. (not investment advice)</p>

Concerns were raised by staff and parents months before Clarke's arrest, but he continued working at the school. The local authority has refused to reveal when concerns were first raised or if an internal investigation will be carried out. This needs investigating to find out why such a horrific man got away with what he did for such a long time when concerns were raised. </p>
