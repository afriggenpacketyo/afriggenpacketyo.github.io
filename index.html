          <p>The Prime Minister of Qatar reported that recent ceasefire discussions between Israel and Hamas have stalled, citing a "fundamental gap" in their objectives. One party seeks a partial agreement potentially leading to a comprehensive resolution, while the other insists on a complete end to the war and the release of all hostages. Hamas claimed Israel isn't serious about negotiations, whereas the Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated Hamas is rejecting the American proposal for hostage release. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces initiated a new ground operation in Gaza, met with condemnation from international leaders who urge cessation and humanitarian aid access.</p>

          <p>George Wendt, famous for his role as Norm Peterson on the sitcom "Cheers," passed away at the age of 76. Wendt, a Chicago native, began his career in comedy at The Second City theater and earned six Emmy nominations for his portrayal of the beer-loving barfly. Before "Cheers," he appeared in television shows like "M*A*S*H," "Taxi," and "Soap," but his big break came with the NBC comedy series. In a 2021 interview, Wendt mentioned that he needed to resemble someone who craved another beer for the role, and he felt he was similar to Norm, but with better writing.</p>

          <p>The recent diagnosis of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with aggressive prostate cancer has raised questions about screening effectiveness. Despite regular PSA tests, some men may suddenly develop advanced prostate cancer due to fast-growing cells that can emerge between screenings or may not be detected by the PSA test. Guidelines recommend against screening men over 70, but many continue testing with their doctor's advice. Experts caution that overtreatment of slow-growing prostate cancers found through screening can lead to devastating side effects without extending life. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The system will integrate with existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of Trump's term, capable of intercepting missiles from any location, including space.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned that Syria could be only weeks away from a "full-scale civil war of epic proportions," calling for support for the country's transitional authorities. He defended President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, arguing that other countries were hesitant to provide aid due to the sanctions. The US had imposed sanctions due to atrocities committed during the 13-year civil war. Concerns remain about the new transitional authorities, dominated by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and recent sectarian violence.</p>

          <p>The FDA is implementing a new approach to COVID-19 vaccines, prioritizing immunizations for high-risk individuals but potentially making it harder for others to access the shots. The new strategy continues the current approval process for older adults and those with health problems but requires additional large studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness for children and younger, healthy adults. This change could mean that annual boosters are not automatically recommended for everyone, but are aimed at high-risk groups. Critics worry the new requirements bypass independent advisers and send the wrong message about vaccine safety.</p>

The resolution defined CRT as a divisive ideology that assigns moral fault based on race, which the court deemed a subjective perception.
