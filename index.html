          <p>India has blocked the X accounts of Chinese state-backed media outlets Global Times and Xinhua, accusing them of spreading disinformation during a recent conflict with Pakistan. While Global Times was briefly blocked but restored, Xinhua's account remains withheld in India due to a legal demand. This action occurred amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir, with both sides making unverified claims about casualties from missile and artillery attacks. The Times of India reported that the accounts were banned for spreading unverified claims on Indian military activities. </p>

          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite is now globally unavailable on iOS devices after Apple blocked its attempt to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. This follows a previous removal of Fortnite from the App Store in 2020 when Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website for in-app purchases. Apple charges developers a 30% fee for purchases made through its app store. Despite Fortnite being available in Europe through Epic Games' own digital store due to the Digital Markets Act, Apple has also blocked its distribution on the Epic Games Store for iOS in the EU. </p>

MPs are considering amendments to ensure no obligation for medical staff to participate and to require government assessment of palliative care availability.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, resulting in a complete shutdown of train service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The strike stems from disagreements over pay raises between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan with enhanced bus service, but it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate impacts, and additional park-and-ride locations have been added. The strike also led to the cancellation of NJ Transit service for a Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium. </p>

          <p>Two Republican lawmakers are calling on Duke University to terminate its joint campus with Wuhan University in China, citing concerns about technology transfers and student manipulation. The congressmen argue that the partnership creates a direct pipeline between US innovation and Chinaâ€™s military-industrial complex and facilitates the use of Americans as pawns for Chinese propaganda. Duke Kunshan University (DKU) was founded in 2013 as a liberal arts-focused joint venture, offering students degrees from both Duke University and DKU, with opportunities to study at Duke's campus in North Carolina. The lawmakers express concern over DKU's specialization in high-technology fields with military applications. </p>

Despite President Trump's call for direct negotiations, the Trump administration has cast doubt on the talks' prospects, suggesting that a breakthrough will only come through a meeting between Trump and Putin.

          <p>The U.S. and United Arab Emirates have agreed on a path for Abu Dhabi to purchase advanced American-made semiconductors for its AI development, according to President Trump. This agreement could potentially allow the UAE to import 500,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips annually, accelerating its ability to build data centers needed for AI models. The Trump administration plans to rescind a Biden-era rule imposing export controls on AI chips, despite concerns that this could allow sensitive technology to reach rivals like China. The announcement follows a partnership between the White House and the UAE to build a massive artificial intelligence campus in Abu Dhabi. </p>

          <p>An Indian and a Filipino climber have died on Mount Everest as hundreds of climbers are attempting to scale the worldâ€™s highest peak. The Indian climber, Subrata Ghosh, died just below the summit while returning from the top, while the Filipino climber, Philipp Santiago, died while heading to the summit. Expedition organizers said the bodies are still on the mountain, and it is yet to be decided if and when they would be brought down. The spring climbing season began in March and ends at the end of May, with May being the best month to climb the peak. </p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article discusses the Democratic Party's failure to acknowledge Joe Biden's declining cognitive abilities, attributing it to groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion. She argues that while Biden's inner circle concealed the extent of his decline, it was evident to many voters. Goldberg suggests that Democrats must confront their missteps to earn back credibility, rather than solely blaming Biden and his aides. The piece highlights a tendency among party leaders to dismiss concerns and polls, underscoring the need for more courage and less deference within the party. </p>

          <p>This article examines India's growing influence in global cricket, driven by its financial strength, political connections, and media presence. The unopposed election of Jay Shah, who also serves as secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), as chair of the International Cricket Council (ICC) has raised concerns about the BCCI's control over global cricket. The IPL's deep entanglement with Indian politics, and India's strained relationship with Pakistan, further illustrate the country's significant role. The article suggests that India's rise as a cricket superpower may threaten the game's diversity and equity, particularly for smaller cricketing nations. </p>

          <p>Chinese trade envoy Li Chenggang described recent trade talks with the U.S. as "good" after high-level engagement in Switzerland led to a temporary easing of trade tensions. However, both sides have maintained a restrained tone, with Beijing remaining tight-lipped on potential meetings or calls between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The first round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a temporary lowering of duties and the establishment of a "communication mechanism" on economic and trade issues. The tariff reprieve has somewhat improved China's economic outlook, prompting some economists to raise this year's growth forecast. </p>

This article explores the history of presidents and members of Congress criticizing the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, when they disagree with their decisions. The term "judicial activism" was coined in 1947, but criticism of the courts predates the term and has come from both ends of the political spectrum.

The case centers on whether the president has the Constitutional power to fire board members at agencies created by Congress to be independent of the White House. Lower court judges have sided with the fired officials, but the Trump administration is appealing, arguing that the Constitution gives the president the power to control the executive branch as he sees fit.
