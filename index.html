          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats returned to Austin, providing Republicans with the necessary quorum to advance a controversial congressional redistricting plan. The proposed maps could grant the Republican party up to five new House seats in the next election cycle. While civil arrest warrants for the absent Democrats remain active, the legislative process on the new maps can now resume. Democrats have vowed to build a legal case against what they call a "discriminatory map," signaling the fight will likely move to the courts.</p>

Trump assured Zelenskyy of "very good protection" and security assistance for Ukraine but did not provide specifics, walking back a previous demand for an immediate ceasefire. The meeting, described as more cordial than their last encounter, focused on achieving a lasting peace, with both leaders expressing openness to a trilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words in the past year, many of which originated from internet culture, social media, and Gen Z slang. Notable entries include "skibidi," a versatile term from a YouTube series, and "delulu," a playful version of delusional. Other additions reflecting modern trends are "tradwife," for women embracing traditional gender roles online, and "mouse jiggler," a device for feigning work activity in remote settings. Lexicographers note that these words are only added if they demonstrate lasting power in the English language.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey from a pre-med student to an Emmy-nominated comedian. He shared how pop culture, particularly SNL, served as a crucial tool for assimilation after his family moved from Quebec to Colorado. Yang discussed his initial resistance to portraying JD Vance on the show, the creative process behind his popular podcast "Las Culturistas," and his personal experiences as the child of Chinese immigrants. He also humorously recounted hiding his copy of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager, treating it like "cultural contraband."</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President Trump in Washington D.C., Russia launched deadly drone strikes on Ukrainian cities, killing at least 10 people. In Kharkiv, seven people died, including a toddler and a teenager, in an attack on a residential building that Ukrainian officials called a deliberate message from Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy addressed the attacks at the start of his meeting, emphasizing the urgent need to stop the war and secure support from international partners. The violence underscores the brutal reality on the ground, even as high-level peace negotiations are underway.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds American Wages Continue to Lag Behind Inflation Four Years After Pandemic</h2>

          <p>A new study from Bankrate reveals that the average American's wages have not kept pace with the rising cost of living over the past four years, with earnings falling 1.2 percentage points behind inflation. This gap contributes to widespread economic dissatisfaction, as three-quarters of Americans report their income is insufficient to cover higher prices. The report highlights that some professions, particularly educators, have fallen further behind than others, while workers in high-demand sectors like leisure and hospitality have seen wages outpace inflation. The findings underscore the ongoing financial strain on many households, impacting their ability to save and build financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit stemmed from false claims aired by Newsmax alleging that Dominion's equipment was used to rig the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, larger case where Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million. Despite the payment, which was disclosed in an SEC filing, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was "fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism," and did not issue an apology.</p>

These knockoff products, sold as both dolls and keychains, pose a serious choking and death risk to young children as they can fit inside a child's mouth or break into small, hazardous pieces. Regulators are advising consumers to stop using any fake dolls immediately and to purchase only from reputable sellers. To identify authentic products, consumers should look for a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code, and nine teeth on the doll.</p>

If a cardholder only makes minimum payments, it could take decades to pay off the balance and cost tens of thousands in total interest.

          <h2>Sale of Homegrown Star Jacob Ramsey Highlights Fan Frustration with Premier League Financial Rules</h2>

          <p>The £40 million transfer of academy graduate Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle has united fans of both clubs in frustration over the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Because the sale of a homegrown player counts as pure profit, such deals have become a crucial way for clubs to comply with financial regulations that limit losses to £105 million over three years. Critics, including football finance experts and players, argue that these rules incentivize clubs to sell their most loyal, locally developed talent, which undermines the connection between fans and their teams, even if it makes accounting sense.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill is proposing that Ed Dwight, the first Black astronaut candidate and recently the oldest person to travel to space, be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Dwight, now 91, was selected for astronaut training by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 but resigned after facing prejudice following Kennedy's assassination. He went on to have a successful career as an entrepreneur and has since become a renowned sculptor, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. His recent spaceflight with Blue Origin fulfilled a journey that was delayed for over six decades.</p>

          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has refused to end its strike, defying a ruling from the Canada Industrial Relations Board that deemed the job action illegal. The strike, now in its third day, has grounded hundreds of flights and affected an estimated 500,000 passengers. Union leaders stated they are willing to face penalties, including fines and jail time, to achieve a negotiated settlement. The flight attendants are demanding higher salaries and pay for ground time, arguing that the airline's latest offer is below inflation and does not adequately compensate them for all hours worked.</p>

Police found three bullet holes in the car, but none of the occupants were injured. The police chief warned both parents about the dangers of such pranks and homeowners about the severe legal consequences of using deadly force in such situations.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open has found that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic. Researchers found that nearly a third of people using the OTC pill had previously used no method of contraception at all, and 41% had switched from a less effective method. The study, which surveyed users of the progestin-only pill Opill, also found that those accessing it without a prescription were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas. This indicates that OTC access is reducing barriers for those who face the most significant challenges in obtaining reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>The "Great Resignation" has given way to the "great stay," with consultants coining the term "job hugging" to describe workers holding onto their current positions. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased confidence in the labor market. This trend is driven by a cooling economy, a lower hiring rate, and slowing job growth, making it harder for those seeking new opportunities to find them. While providing stability, experts warn that job hugging can lead to stagnated wage growth and skill development for employees.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts recommend that investors utilize dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to automatically use stock dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock. This strategy is a simple and effective way to harness the power of compound interest over the long term. For example, over a recent 10-year period, the S&P 500's price return was 185%, but with dividends reinvested, the total cumulative return grew to 239%. While investors who need the cash for income should not reinvest, it is a powerful passive strategy for most others to build wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that while homeowners can qualify for a reverse mortgage at age 62, the best time to take one out is often later, typically in the late 60s or early 70s. The amount of equity a senior can access increases with age, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. The ideal timing also depends on individual circumstances, such as immediate income needs, long-term financial goals, and a commitment to aging in place. A reverse mortgage can be a useful tool to supplement retirement income, but getting one too early can limit its long-term benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
