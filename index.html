          <h2>Advocates Warn of Unaffordable Payments as Trump Administration Overhauls Student Loan System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 09:21:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is overhauling the federal student loan system, notably ending the Biden-era SAVE plan, which advocates say was the most affordable repayment program. Consumer advocates and legal experts warn that these changes could leave many borrowers with no affordable options, significantly increasing the risk of default. Under the new "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) for future borrowers, monthly payments are projected to be substantially higher than under the previous SAVE plan. This shift is expected to place considerable financial stress on millions of Americans managing their education debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, dropped significantly following a statement from President Donald Trump. Trump announced he had spoken with Coca-Cola and that the company agreed to start using real cane sugar in its U.S. products, a move he praised as being "just better." While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the market reacted swiftly, with ADM's stock falling over 6% at one point. The Corn Refiners Association warned that such a switch could lead to the loss of thousands of American manufacturing jobs and harm farm income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M) alleges that a Chinese state-owned company, China South Industries Corporation, is providing essential support for the production of aerial bombs used by Myanmar's junta. These weapons are reportedly being used in indiscriminate attacks against civilians amid the country's ongoing civil war. The report details how China South has supplied components, technical training, and engineering assistance to a key weapons factory in Myanmar. Human rights advocates are calling on China to cease its support, stating it makes the country complicit in the junta's violations of international law.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary has sparked concerns about a potential exodus of wealthy residents, primarily due to his proposal to increase taxes on millionaires. The proposed tax would raise the combined city and state top rate to the highest in the nation, prompting some business owners and high-earners to consider relocating. However, data shows that despite some high-profile departures, NYC's luxury real estate market remains strong and the city continues to generate new millionaires at a rapid pace. Analysts are divided on whether the tax would truly trigger a significant wealth flight or if the city's economic appeal will outweigh the higher tax burden. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under the second Trump administration, the Department of Justice appears to be shifting its focus away from prosecuting white-collar crimes, particularly those involving corporate entities or financial fraud. The administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal prosecutions for white-collar offenses have declined, while investigations into political opponents have been initiated. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue this approach turns a blind eye to corporate malfeasance that harms ordinary people. This pattern, combined with presidential pardons for financial fraudsters, suggests a more lenient stance on corporate crime unless it aligns with specific political narratives.</p>

          <p>For 70 years, Disney has successfully leveraged its vast portfolio of intellectual property as the foundation for its theme parks, a strategy that continues to be a major profit driver. The experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, generates significantly more operating income than the entertainment division where the IP originates. Following major acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, the company has increasingly focused on creating immersive, IP-based lands and attractions. Despite occasional fan backlash over the replacement of classic rides, this approach has broadened Disney's audience and is central to its planned $60 billion investment in experiences over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Despite the African Union's goal of enabling free movement for all Africans, a 2018 protocol to achieve this has been ratified by only four of the bloc's nations. The slow progress is hindering the full potential of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), as the movement of people is crucial for trade. Many countries have hesitated to ratify the agreement due to concerns over national security, a lack of harmonized border systems, and potential loss of revenue from visa fees. Proponents, however, point to Rwanda as a success story, where an open-door policy has boosted tourism and economic activity.</p>

          <h2>Southeast Asian Nations Concerned Over US Tariffs Targeting Transshipment of Chinese Goods</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade deals with Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Indonesia include steep tariffs on "transshipped" goods, a move aimed at curbing China's ability to evade U.S. tariffs. This policy targets Chinese products that are rerouted through these nations, relabeled, and then exported to the U.S. Southeast Asian economies are now concerned about how broadly the U.S. will define transshipment. A strict definition could devastate their manufacturing sectors, which are heavily reliant on Chinese components and inputs, and potentially impact U.S. companies like Apple and Nike that operate there.

          <p>Two years after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, data indicates that the number of abortions in the U.S. has actually increased. At the same time, there has been a sharp rise in voluntary sterilizations among young adults, suggesting a rejection of pronatalist pressures. The article argues that while anti-abortion activists aimed to make abortion unthinkable, the reality has been an increase in procedures, rising maternal mortality in states with bans, and the criminal prosecution of pregnant people. This outcome contradicts the stated goals of the anti-abortion movement to reduce abortions and encourage more births.</p>

          <p>A report from China's official Science and Technology Daily newspaper warns that the country is at risk of creating a surplus of artificial intelligence computing centers due to a boom in uncoordinated construction. While the demand for AI has spurred the rapid development of these facilities, many are reportedly being launched blindly and are now sitting idle. As of November, China had nearly 150 such centers operating with around 400 more planned or under construction. This rush to build has led to wasted resources and market imbalances, potentially undermining the high-quality development of China's domestic computing power industry.</p>

          <p>China is preparing for a difficult job-hunting season as a record number of college graduates are expected to enter the labor market this summer. Although the youth unemployment rate has seen a slight easing in recent months, it remains higher than the previous year, indicating persistent strain. Officials from the National Bureau of Statistics have acknowledged that employment pressure on young people and other key groups has intensified. The influx of new graduates is anticipated to pose a significant challenge to an already competitive job market, mirroring the sharp increase in youth unemployment seen during last year's graduation season.</p>

          <p>Following the Justice Department's recent announcement that no "Epstein client list" exists, investigative reporter Julie K. Brown explores the complex narrative surrounding the case. She explains that the saga is rife with elements that fuel conspiracy theories, but also contains verifiable truths about a broken justice system that failed victims. Brown clarifies that the so-called "list" was likely a misinterpretation of Epstein's personal contact directory, which included everyone from his gardener to powerful figures. She argues the most critical unanswered question is not about a list, but about who in the DOJ initially allowed Epstein to receive a lenient plea deal in 2008.</p>

          <p>The beauty industry is rapidly expanding its market to include children, tweens, and teens, with spending on skincare among these age groups seeing a significant increase. Critics and medical experts express concern over this trend, pointing to the potential physical and psychological harm of using products with active ingredients like retinoids on developing skin. This phenomenon is driven by social media trends, the collapse of age-appropriate media spaces, and the industry's constant need for market expansion. Experts argue that the focus should be on examining the adult beauty culture that creates these pressures, rather than simply criticizing the children who emulate it.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced plans to cut up to 500 management jobs in the United Kingdom through a voluntary redundancy program. The company stated the move is "normal business practice" but it comes as the automaker faces significant pressure on its sales and profits due to U.S. trade tariffs. JLR's sales have recently dropped, partly because it paused exports to the U.S. in response to tariff announcements. While a new UK-US trade deal has reduced the tariff rate, industry experts note it is still a substantial increase that continues to impact the company's financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims circulating on social media, there is no scientific evidence to support the assertion that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer. Health experts and organizations confirm that UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen is a proven tool for protection. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historically less effective sunscreen formulas, not the use of modern products. While countries with high sunscreen use may also have high cancer rates, this is a correlation linked to sun exposure habits and awareness, not a causal link from the product itself.</p>
