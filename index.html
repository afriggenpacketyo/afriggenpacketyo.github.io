        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans continue to hold a negative view of the national economy, with most describing its state as "uncertain" and "struggling." The primary driver behind this sentiment remains the high cost of goods, as two-thirds of respondents report that prices are still rising and expect them to continue increasing. While personal financial ratings vary by income level, the overall economic outlook is pessimistic, with many believing conditions are worsening and a quarter anticipating a recession. Partisan views influence perceptions, though negative sentiment is widespread across political affiliations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Speaking at the U.S. Capitol, survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring shared emotional testimonies and called for the public release of all related investigative files. Victim Lisa Phillips announced that the survivors are compiling their own confidential list of Epstein's associates who were allegedly involved in the abuse, creating a resource by and for survivors. The event, organized by lawmakers, aimed to pressure the Department of Justice to release an estimated 100,000 pages of material, as advocates argue that previously released documents were overwhelmingly already public. Survivors expressed fear of repercussions for naming individuals themselves, highlighting the need for official transparency and protection.</p>

          <p>The White House issued a sharp rebuke to New York Governor Kathy Hochul after she criticized President Trump in a social media post concerning the introduction of commercials to the popular "NFL RedZone" broadcast. Governor Hochul had posted, "More commercials, less football. Trump’s America," and called on the NFL and ESPN to reverse the decision. A Trump spokesman dismissed the governor's comment as "moronic." The broadcast, known for its commercial-free format, will reportedly feature a double-box display showing advertisements alongside game action, a change that has sparked significant reaction from fans and public figures.</p>

          <p>Following a more than 5% drop in Salesforce's stock after its latest earnings report, CEO Marc Benioff described the company's guidance as "appropriately conservative." While Salesforce surpassed Wall Street's estimates for earnings and revenue, its forward-looking guidance disappointed investors, contributing to the stock's decline. Benioff highlighted the success of the company's artificial intelligence products, stating they are helping customers fundamentally transform their businesses and have allowed Salesforce to reduce its own service and support staff. He also emphasized competitive wins against rivals like Palantir for government contracts, citing lower prices as a key advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal judge has reversed the Trump administration's decision to freeze approximately $2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the institution's First Amendment rights. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the government's justification for the freeze, which included accusations of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies, was likely a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault."

          <p>The Trump administration is actively working to reshape the public memory of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack by portraying its participants as heroes and martyrs. This effort includes the Air Force granting military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot while storming the Capitol, and a reported $5 million settlement with her family. Furthermore, President Trump has issued sweeping pardons for rioters and purged prosecutors involved in their cases, replacing them with allies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With government funding set to expire at the end of the month, congressional leaders are trading blame over a potential shutdown, indicating a deepening partisan standoff. House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of pushing for a shutdown, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted that a bipartisan solution is the only path forward. A key point of contention is the Democratic demand to reverse Medicaid cuts included in President Trump's major legislative package in exchange for their votes on a funding bill. The White House is unlikely to support any measure that weakens this signature policy, complicating negotiations and making a short-term funding resolution increasingly difficult to achieve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The projected cost to expand the downtown Los Angeles Convention Center has risen again, now reaching $2.7 billion, an increase of nearly $500 million in just six months. City officials are increasingly concerned that the project's first phase will not be completed in time for the 2028 Olympic Games, for which it is a key venue. A major risk to the project's financing is its reliance on revenue from digital billboards, which requires state approval that is not guaranteed. If that revenue fails to materialize, the city's general fund would be responsible for covering an average of $111 million per year in costs through 2058.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Legal experts have raised concerns that the recent U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean, which the White House said killed 11 drug traffickers, may have violated international law. The attack on the vessel, which President Trump claimed was operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel, took place in international waters. Experts interviewed by BBC Verify noted that under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, interference with vessels on the high seas is highly restricted, and the use of lethal force is generally prohibited unless in self-defense. They argue the act could be considered an "extrajudicial arbitrary killing" and a violation of the right to life under human rights law.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced plans to phase out all mandatory childhood vaccinations for school and daycare attendance, a move that would make Florida the first state in the U.S. to do so.

The announcement drew immediate and strong condemnation from physician groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned that the policy is dangerous, reckless, and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases, posing a significant public health risk.</p>

          <p>The Idaho Attorney General's office has announced that it will not file criminal charges against four Pocatello police officers who fatally shot Victor Perez, a 17-year-old with autism. The incident occurred in April when officers responded to a 911 call about a male with a knife. Prosecutors concluded they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers' use of deadly force was unjustified, as the officers were unaware of Perez's age or disabilities. The officers believed they were confronting an intoxicated man threatening others and stated they feared for their safety when Perez, holding a knife, stepped toward them.</p>

The win marks a significant return to form for the 25-year-old, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent results in recent years after reaching a career-high ranking of No. 6 in 2022.

The case involved a bizarre series of events where Todd Stermer escaped their burning Michigan home, only to be run over and killed by a van his wife was driving. Prosecutors argued she intentionally set the fire and then ran him over, presenting circumstantial evidence including an alleged affair and witness testimony. After her initial 2010 conviction was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to prosecutorial misconduct, she was retried and convicted again, with her family remaining deeply divided over her guilt.</p>

The bill is backed by a wide range of representatives from across the political spectrum, who argue that the current rules create public distrust and the appearance of conflicts of interest. Supporters are threatening to force a floor vote on the measure if leadership does not bring it up for consideration by the end of the month.</p>
