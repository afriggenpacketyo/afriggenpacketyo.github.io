          <h2>Nvidia Reports Strong Revenue Growth Driven by AI Demand, Navigates Geopolitical Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia announced a 56% surge in revenue to $46.7 billion for the second quarter, fueled by strong demand from major tech firms expanding their AI capabilities. Despite this growth, the company's shares experienced a slight dip due to concerns over geopolitical tensions between the US and China, which impact its sales to the Chinese market. Nvidia's CEO highlighted the ongoing "AI race" and the company's significant contribution to AI infrastructure, even as it lobbies the US government for chip sales approvals. The firm, which recently became the world's first $4 trillion company, remains central to the AI boom but faces scrutiny over market exuberance.</p>

          <p>European markets are poised for a higher open, reacting to Nvidia's robust sales growth forecast, despite its data center revenue missing estimates and concerns about China sales. Beyond the tech sector, French spirits giant Pernod Ricard reported a 3% sales decline due to weak consumer sentiment in China and US tariff uncertainties. Meanwhile, European Union new car registrations rose by 7.4% in July, with battery-electric vehicles seeing a significant 39.1% increase, notably driven by Chinese EV maker BYD's substantial growth. Investors await further EU consumer and economic sentiment figures, alongside inflation prints from key European nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new rule to cap the length of stay for international students and exchange visitors in the U.S. to four years, aiming to curb "visa abuse" and enhance oversight. This change would replace the current "duration of status" policy, which allows students to remain indefinitely while enrolled. The Department of Homeland Security argues that some foreign students have exploited the system, posing security risks and disadvantaging U.S. citizens. Critics, however, warn that this policy could deter international enrollment, negatively impacting American economies, innovation, and global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following reports that individuals linked to President Donald Trump were conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. Public broadcaster DR alleged that these operations aimed to weaken Greenland's ties with Denmark and promote secession to the U.S. The U.S. State Department confirmed the meeting, stating it doesn't control private citizens' actions, while reaffirming strong ties. Danish officials expressed concern over any interference in the Kingdom's internal affairs, especially given Trump's previous interest in acquiring the strategically located Arctic territory.</p>

The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics, with a manifesto from the suspect found and taken down.

          <h2>Taylor Swift's Engagement Highlights Phenomenon of Parasocial Relationships Among Fans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions among her fans, drawing attention to the concept of "parasocial relationships." These one-sided connections, where individuals feel intimacy with a celebrity who doesn't know them, are increasingly common due to constant access to private details via social media. Psychologists note that while such relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, especially during isolated times, they cannot replace reciprocal real-life friendships. Experts liken them to "fast food" for the human need for connection, providing taste but lacking true nutritional content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK, exempt from import duties, more than doubled last year to £3 billion, largely driven by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. These low-value imports now constitute 51% of all small packages entering the UK, up from 35% previously. The UK government is reviewing these rules amidst calls from British businesses and industry groups for swifter action to protect High Street retailers from being undercut and consumers from potentially unsafe goods. Other regions like the US and EU have already taken steps to address similar "de minimis" exemptions, indicating a global trend towards re-evaluating these trade policies.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom asserted that Donald Trump is seriously considering a third term in office, a move that would violate the U.S. Constitution. Newsom highlighted Trump's disregard for democratic norms, citing an Oval Office conversation where Trump pointed to a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms, and discussed the possibility of a third. The governor, known for his combative stance against Trump, urged Americans to take these threats seriously, emphasizing that the rule of law is at stake. Trump has publicly entertained the idea of circumventing the 22nd Amendment, despite constitutional limitations.</p>

This trend mirrors similar struggles faced by other major baijiu makers, including Kweichow Moutai and Jiugui Liquor, which also reported their weakest growth in ten years.

A police raid on the villa found German documents but not the artwork itself. This case highlights Argentina's historical role in sheltering Nazis who fled Europe after World War II, often bringing plundered Jewish property with them.</p>

The Scottish Conservative leader faces immense pressure, with attempts to shift his party right risking alienation of moderate voters.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased an ace-like pitching performance for the Los Angeles Dodgers, leading them to a 5-1 victory and a sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. In his first full five-inning start since resuming two-way duties after Tommy John surgery, Ohtani impressed with a new, unpredictable pitch selection, utilizing his curveball and splitter more frequently. He recorded nine strikeouts and secured his first pitching win of the season, demonstrating his ability to work deeper into games. This dominant outing is crucial for Ohtani's potential postseason role, providing the Dodgers with more rotation options.</p>

          <p>Kyiv was hit by a massive Russian missile and drone strike, resulting in at least eight confirmed deaths, including a child, and dozens injured. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, stating Russia chooses "ballistics instead of the negotiating table" and exploits the world's indifference to murdered children. He called for new, tough sanctions against Russia and urged China and Hungary to react. This aggression precedes upcoming US-Ukraine talks in New York on security guarantees, with Zelenskyy emphasizing the need for global resolve to make Russia accountable for the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Following public outcry, USC has offered Notre Dame a multi-year extension to continue their nearly 100-year-old football rivalry, with USC's athletic director expressing hope for a swift agreement. USC was initially hesitant due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands, proposing only a short-term extension. However, Notre Dame insisted on a long-term commitment. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to balance its Big Ten schedule, while Notre Dame has more flexibility. Both schools acknowledge the rivalry's significance to college football.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU this year, half of which is in Spain and Portugal. This unprecedented scale, linked directly to climate change, has seen Spain's burned area six times its average, and Portugal's almost five times. The fires have dramatically decreased air quality and released a record 17.68 million tonnes of CO2 in Spain alone. Experts warn of more frequent and severe fires due to extreme heat and dry vegetation, exacerbated by rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has begun moving detainees from "Alligator Alcatraz," a controversial state-run immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, after a federal judge ordered its operations to wind down. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling by an "activist judge," but is complying by transferring detainees to other facilities. The center, part of a broader push to expand mass deportations, has faced allegations of inhumane conditions, which federal and state officials deny. The judge's order prohibits new construction and transfers, and requires the removal of certain equipment, though Florida is appealing the decision.</p>

Zhou highlighted concerns that some industry players might exploit stablecoin hype to boost valuations, focusing on short-term gains rather than long-term profitability or sustainability.
