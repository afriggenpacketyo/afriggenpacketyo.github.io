The case has sparked controversy, with some supporters claiming Mangione is a "political prisoner" and criticizing the Attorney General's decision to seek the death penalty. The judge reminded prosecutors that public commentary could impact a fair trial, while the defense argued for the federal trial to proceed first due to constitutional concerns.</p>

          <p>In Alberta, Canada, the topic of national unity is being heavily debated, with some residents expressing a desire for separation or even joining the United States. This sentiment stems from a feeling of "western alienation" and dissatisfaction with federal policies, particularly those related to the oil and gas industry. While polls suggest that outright separation is unlikely, the issue poses a challenge for Canada's next prime minister, especially if the Liberal Party secures another victory, potentially exacerbating regional divisions.</p>

Concerns about sacks, arm strength, and adapting to a coach other than his father may have contributed to his slide.
