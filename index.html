            <p>Donald Trump replaced the acting commissioner of the IRS, Gary Shapley, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained that the appointment occurred without his knowledge and under the instruction of Elon Musk. Bessent believed Musk had circumvented him to install Shapley, leading to Trump approving the decision's reversal. Michael Faulkender is expected to become the next acting head. The conflict between Bessent and Musk became public on social media, with Musk supporting a conspiracy theory against Bessent.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is shifting its focus under Trump ally Harmeet Dhillon, prioritizing issues such as noncitizen voters and discrimination against white people over traditional civil rights protections. New mission statements for the division's sections reflect this change, with limited mention of the Voting Rights Act or the Fair Housing Act. Critics argue that this represents a complete abdication of the division's core responsibilities and a move to use the department for political goals. The DOJ has already begun to pull back on civil rights cases filed under the Biden administration.</p>

She asserts that Putin's actions are destroying the European peace order and that protecting Ukraine is essential for maintaining peace in Europe.

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a rule to reclassify some career civil servants as "at-will" employees, allowing for easier termination of underperforming or subversive workers. The White House claims this rule empowers agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles for poor performance, misconduct, or subversion of presidential directives. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that around 50,000 positions will be changed to this new status. Civil service employees currently have more protections than political appointees, a rule intended to prevent turnover between administrations.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is in a standoff with Donald Trump after rejecting a series of demands from the president’s administration, which critics view as an attack on the elite college for its reputation among conservatives as a bastion of liberal thought. After cutting off its funding, Trump has reportedly given the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a potentially illegal order to revoke the university’s tax-exempt status. Such a decision would mark an escalation in the Republican president’s weaponization of federal government agencies against the people and institutions that defy it.</p>

Experts are skeptical about shooting the animals from helicopters as the best approach, recommending rescue as the first option.

            <p>This review discusses Farah Nabulsi's film, "The Teacher", which explores the life of Basem, a West Bank educator struggling to maintain normalcy amidst the Israeli occupation. The film follows Basem's relationship with a troubled student and his secret involvement in an operation to liberate imprisoned Palestinians. While the film's narrative is muddled by multiple subplots and contrived dialogue, the reviewer praises Saleh Bakri's performance as Basem, highlighting his ability to convey inner peace and resistance. Ultimately, the film emphasizes the importance of living despite the painful realities of occupation.</p>
