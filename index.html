          <p>The United States has established a new trade agreement with Vietnam, replacing a potential 46% levy with a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports. As part of the deal, Vietnam will eliminate tariffs on U.S. products, granting American goods full market access. The agreement also includes a higher 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, particularly China, a practice the administration has sought to curtail. This development comes as the Trump administration continues to renegotiate trade relationships with various global partners, aiming for what it terms "reciprocal" arrangements.</p>

          <p>Following his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, Sean 'Diddy' Combs will remain detained until his sentencing. A judge denied his request for bail, citing mandatory detention for the crimes and disagreeing with the defense's arguments for his release. Prosecutors argued that Combs is a flight risk and has shown no remorse for his actions. Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution but was acquitted of more severe charges like racketeering and sex trafficking, with a sentencing date proposed for early October.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing a federal civil rights complaint filed by America First Legal, a conservative group co-founded by Stephen Miller. The complaint alleges that the team's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives constitute unlawful employment discrimination based on race and sex, violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The group specifically targets the Dodgers' employee networks and mission to value diverse voices, claiming these practices lead to discriminatory hiring. The Dodgers have declined to comment on the complaint, which follows their recent public support for families affected by immigration raids.</p>

          <p>The University of California has issued a directive banning its student governments and other official university entities from participating in boycotts against Israel. The move comes in response to pressure from the Trump administration, which tied federal research grants to an institution's stance on such boycotts. UC President Michael Drake clarified that while individual expression is protected, university entities must adhere to policies that prohibit boycotts of companies based on their national affiliation. This policy reinforces the university's long-standing opposition to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement and could impact student governments that have previously passed anti-Israel resolutions.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic critiques Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s support for the Republican "Big Beautiful Bill," arguing its deep cuts to Medicaid contradict his stated mission to "Make America healthy again." The article points out that the bill, which Kennedy has praised, would remove nearly 12 million people from health insurance, including many with the chronic diseases he aims to fight. While Kennedy argues for shrinking Medicaid to focus on the most vulnerable, the article contends that the program is a vital solution for the health woes of low-income Americans. It suggests his stance undermines his own public health agenda.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson, has warned that the Republican budget bill currently in Congress could have a devastating impact on the organization. A provision in the bill would block healthcare non-profits that offer abortions from receiving Medicaid funds for one year, potentially costing Planned Parenthood about $700 million. This could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in blue states where abortion remains legal and many patients rely on Medicaid. Opponents of the provision are calling it a "backdoor abortion ban" that would gut a critical healthcare safety net for millions of people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis challenges the conventional wisdom that Sun Belt cities offer an affordable alternative to expensive coastal housing markets like New York and Los Angeles. Over the past decade, median home prices in cities such as Phoenix, Miami, and Atlanta have surged at rates outpacing their coastal counterparts. The article suggests this is due to a slowdown in housing production, restrictive zoning laws similar to those on the coasts, and growing NIMBYism. This trend indicates that the "pressure-release valve" of the Sun Belt is closing, potentially making the nation's housing affordability crisis more widespread and uniform.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon now assesses that last month's US airstrikes against three of Iran's nuclear facilities have set back its program by approximately one to two years. A defense department spokesperson confirmed this internal intelligence assessment, which is a more significant estimate than an initial low-confidence report suggesting a delay of only several months. The updated assessment is reportedly based on material indicating the destruction of centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. This new information provides a clearer picture of the strategic impact of the operation, though it is more measured than the President's claims of complete obliteration.</p>

          <p>Saudi boxing official Turki Alalshikh has suggested that former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury could come out of retirement for a fight in 2026. In a social media post, Alalshikh stated he has Fury's "word to have him in Riyadh season," hinting at a potential high-profile bout. Fury, who retired in January after a loss to Oleksandr Usyk, fueled the speculation by reposting the message and also mentioning a desire for a rematch with Usyk or a major fight against Anthony Joshua in England. The news has sparked excitement in the boxing world about the possible return of the "Gypsy King."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for a $30 billion investment in naval shipbuilding to counter China's rapidly growing fleet. This funding would be a significant part of a larger defense reconciliation bill, fast-tracking the process through Congress. The strategy also involves increasing cooperation with allies like Japan and South Korea to bolster naval power in the Indo-Pacific. However, analysts warn that catching up to China's immense shipbuilding capacity will be a major challenge, citing political pressures to keep jobs in the U.S. and the sheer scale of China's industrial base as significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed breakdown of the verdict in the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial, where he was acquitted of the most serious charges but convicted on two others. He was found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, but guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act. To secure a racketeering conviction, prosecutors needed to prove he ran a criminal enterprise with his staff, which the defense successfully argued was not the case. The convictions for transportation relate to flying women across state lines for sexual encounters involving paid escorts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that effectively banned migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president overstepped his authority by bypassing existing immigration law, stating that the proclamation did not grant the power for an "extra-statutory" system of removing individuals without an asylum opportunity. The ruling is a setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda, though the judge has stayed the decision for two weeks to allow for an appeal. The ACLU, which brought the case, celebrated the decision as a protection for those fleeing danger.</p>

In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he said his successor should be identified through traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices, signaling that China should not interfere in the process. This decision is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to anger Beijing, which claims sole authority to approve the next leader.

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has launched a new 10-year plan for the National Health Service in England, aiming to "fundamentally rewire" how care is delivered. The strategy involves shifting millions of patients from hospitals to a new network of around 200 neighborhood health hubs. These hubs will be staffed by a mix of healthcare professionals and offer services closer to home, with the goal of having the majority of outpatient care occur outside of hospitals by 2035. While the government says the plan will reduce waiting lists, healthcare unions have raised concerns about staffing and funding for the ambitious shift.</p>
