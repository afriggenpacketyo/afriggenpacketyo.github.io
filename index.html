          <p>Aryna Sabalenka won her second straight U.S. Open women's singles title, defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3). This victory marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam title overall and makes her the first woman to win consecutive U.S. Open trophies since Serena Williams did so from 2012 to 2014. The win was particularly significant as Sabalenka had previously lost two major finals earlier in the season at the Australian Open and French Open, overcoming previous high-stakes disappointments.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party has publicly distanced itself from comments made by Dr. Aseem Malholtra, a guest speaker at its conference, who suggested a link between COVID-19 vaccines and the cancers affecting the King and the Princess of Wales. The party stated it does not endorse his views but believes in free speech, a stance criticized by Health Secretary Wes Streeting as "shockingly irresponsible." Medical experts have widely discredited Dr. Malholtra's claims, calling them baseless pseudoscience and conspiracy theories with no credible scientific evidence.</p>

In response to the potential for high winds and heavy rainfall early next week, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency to facilitate preparations and mobilize resources.</p>

          <p>An attack by Boko Haram jihadists on the town of Darul Jama in Nigeria's Borno state has left at least 60 people dead, including several soldiers. According to residents, dozens of armed fighters on motorcycles entered the town on Friday night, shooting indiscriminately and setting fire to homes. Many of the victims were people who had only recently returned to the area after being displaced by the long-running insurgency. The attack represents a significant setback for regional security and resettlement efforts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has destroyed the Sussi Tower, a high-rise building in Gaza City, marking the second such structure it has targeted in two days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed the building was used by Hamas, a charge the group denies. This action is part of an expanding military operation in the city, with the IDF dropping leaflets urging remaining civilians to evacuate to a designated humanitarian zone in the south. The destruction of these towers is described by local officials as a policy of forced displacement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to deny a media request to unseal the names of two individuals who received large payments from Jeffrey Epstein in 2018. The two unnamed associates, described as potential co-conspirators, received $100,000 and $250,000 respectively, shortly after a news series critical of Epstein's 2008 plea deal was published. Citing privacy concerns expressed by the individuals, the DOJ is opposing the release, while prosecutors had previously suggested the payments could have been attempts to influence witnesses.</p>
