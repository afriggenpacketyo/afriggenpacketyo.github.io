          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 11:15:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration implement a tariff exclusion process to prevent a recession and protect small businesses, citing concerns that tariffs are causing irreparable harm. In a letter to key trade officials, the Chamber's CEO, Suzanne Clark, emphasized the need for immediate action to save American small businesses. While the Chamber is opting not to challenge the tariffs in court, they seek tariff exclusions for businesses demonstrating significant risks to U.S. employment. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller suggested the administration is not considering tariff exemptions, proposing tax cuts as relief for small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has collected approximately $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court appearances, with the money never being returned. These arrests are part of Governor Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star, aimed at increasing border security. The county has been aggressive in enforcing trespassing laws, leading to the forfeiture of bail from hundreds of migrants, many of whom were seeking economic opportunities. While county officials claim they are deterring illegal crossings and protecting residents, critics argue that the practice is unfair, as migrants are unable to attend court due to deportation.</p>

While ICE has long collaborated with local authorities, the agency is now empowering them to make immigration arrests, potentially increasing deportation capabilities.

The board argues that Trump is attempting to establish a presidency unrestrained by Congress or the courts, potentially altering the character of American government. While acknowledging that some of Trump's policies are legal and even effective, the editorial board stresses the importance of opposing his undemocratic actions through a broad coalition of Americans across the political spectrum. The editorial identifies attacks on the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people as key areas of concern.</p>

          <p>More than 100 children in Bihar, India, fell sick after consuming a school lunch in which a dead snake was reportedly found. India's National Human Rights Commission is investigating the incident, demanding reports from local government officials and police. The meal was served in a government-run school, and the incident sparked protests from the children's families. Free lunches are offered to millions of children in government schools throughout India to encourage education, but there have been frequent complaints of poor food hygiene.</p>

          <p>Investors in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may face an unexpectedly high tax bill on their profits due to the IRS classifying gold and other precious metals as "collectibles." Collectibles are subject to a maximum federal tax rate of 28% on long-term capital gains, compared to the 20% rate for stocks and real estate. The higher tax rate applies to ETFs structured as trusts, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU).
