            <p>A judge has denied a motion to enforce an order on AP access, stating that White House officials are entitled to a presumption of good faith. This decision comes amid President Trump's continued executive actions, including targeting a former administration official who became a critic. Legal focus remains on the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant wrongfully deported, and top Cabinet officials are in Paris discussing the Russia-Ukraine war, aiming to foster discussions for peace and resolution to the ongoing conflict. The Trump administration is trying to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape of the conflict.</p>

            <p>Authorities have identified the suspect in the Florida State University shooting as a 20-year-old student, Phoenix Ikner, revealing a history of a custody battle between his birth parents. Court records indicate a years-long dispute between Anne-Mari Eriksen and Christopher Ikner, with allegations of slander, libel, and parental alienation. The weapon used in the shooting belonged to the suspect's stepmother, Jessica Ikner, a Leon County Sheriff's deputy.

Despite a judge denying a temporary restraining order, the ACLU filed a new emergency application after reports that ICE officers coerced a client into signing deportation papers, and the Trump administration continues to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.</p>

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the term 'sex' in the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex, defining it as binary (male or female). This decision impacts single-sex services like domestic violence shelters, where biological sex is considered paramount for safety and privacy. The court emphasized that the ruling applies only to interpreting anti-discrimination law and doesn't invalidate transgender identities. Transgender people retain their own legal protections under the Act, safeguarding against discrimination based on gender reassignment.</p>

The Probation Department must submit a plan detailing the relocation of approximately 270 juveniles to other secure locations.

The potential social network is viewed as a way to gather more training data and keep users hooked on OpenAI's products, but may be a distraction from the pursuit of AGI.</p>

            <p>President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that interest rates would be lower if Powell "understood what he was doing." The White House has intensified its attacks on Powell, with economic adviser Kevin Hassett suggesting the possibility of removing him. Trump's remarks follow Powell's warning that the president's tariff plan could drive up inflation. Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have defended Powell, cautioning that firing the Fed chair would destabilize U.S. financial markets.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to abandon Ukraine peace talks, signaling a lack of expertise and patience for a complicated negotiation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed frustration, stating the U.S. may "move on" if progress isn't made, while Vice President JD Vance expressed optimism about securing a ceasefire. The administration's approach appears to prioritize quick deals with minimal effort, potentially undermining Ukraine's position and benefiting Russia's interests. The decision to potentially walk away from the negotiation process could have far reaching geopolitical ramifications.</p>

            <p>The article discusses President Trump's clash with Harvard University and its implications for higher education. Trump seeks to condition federal grants to universities on their compliance with civil rights laws, aiming to address fiscal and cultural excesses in elite American higher education. The author argues that American universities no longer conduce to the common good, as they once did, and that Trump's actions are a necessary recalibration of the taxpayer-university relationship. The piece explores the debate surrounding federal funding and academic freedom.</p>

            <p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs is backing off a plan to send telehealth therapists back to offices that may lack privacy, according to a memo obtained by NPR. Officials from the VA have issued a memo saying that providers must have private workspaces "that foster trusted, confidential, and therapeutic relationships with Veterans," when they return to their offices in the coming weeks. Confusion remains, however, as the memo does not explicitly say therapists would be allowed to continue working from their homes, if private office space is unavailable.</p>

Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week.</p>

Despite their allegations of Abrego Garcia being a terrorist due to his alleged ties to MS-13, the Department of Justice has made no such claims in court — just the court of public opinion.</p>
