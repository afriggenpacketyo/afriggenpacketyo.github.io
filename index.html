          <h2>Eurozone Inflation Remains Steady, ECB Rate Cuts Still Possible Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 05:53:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Euro zone inflation held steady at 2.2% in April, defying expectations of a decrease, while core inflation rose to 2.7%. Despite the lack of decline, economists suggest that temporary Easter-related effects are influencing services inflation, which may reverse in the coming months, potentially paving the way for further interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB). However, uncertainty surrounding potential tariff escalations introduces a degree of risk, as increased tariffs could lead to higher inflation in Europe. ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that the central bank would remain extremely data-dependent when making future interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>A ship belonging to the Freedom Flotilla, carrying aid and activists to Gaza, was reportedly attacked by drones in international waters off Malta, causing significant damage. The Freedom Flotilla, which campaigns against Israel's blockade of Gaza, reported that the ship's hull was breached, leading to water intake and a distress call. While the group did not immediately attribute the attack, Israeli forces have previously intercepted Freedom Flotilla vessels. Maltese authorities confirmed the fire was under control and all crew members were safe, though the number of people on board reported by the Flotilla differed from the government's statement.</p>

          <p>Slow TV, featuring long, unnarrated coverage of events in real-time, is gaining popularity as a form of relaxation and connection with nature. Originating in Norway, the trend has expanded globally, with livestreams of elk migrations, stork nests, and zoo animals attracting millions of viewers. These broadcasts offer a contrast to the fast-paced nature of modern media, providing viewers with a calming and reflective experience. Educators are also utilizing slow TV as a tool for teaching children about nature and environmental awareness, highlighting its potential to foster a deeper appreciation for the natural world.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has classified the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as a right-wing extremist organization. This decision follows a comprehensive review, concluding that the AfD's conception of the German people based on ethnicity and ancestry is incompatible with the country's free democratic order. The agency specifically noted the AfD's discriminatory views towards citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." While the AfD is likely to challenge the classification in court, it could lower the threshold for monitoring the party and encourage efforts to ban it.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is working to manage the impact of a cyber attack that has forced the retailer to temporarily shut down its online operations. CEO Stuart Machin apologized to customers for the disruption, acknowledging the significant impact on online transactions, which account for a third of clothing and home sales. The cyber attack has also led to gaps on food shelves in some stores and disrupted the loyalty scheme and gift card payments. Analysts suggest M&S risks losing customers to rivals as online shoppers can easily switch to other retailers.</p>

These results indicate that Reform UK poses a threat to both the Conservative and Labour parties. The Conservatives face a particularly bleak outlook, while Labour must contend with Reform's appeal to voters dissatisfied with the status quo.

          <p>The children of Leonard Bernstein, Nina Bernstein Simmons, Alexander Bernstein, and Jamie Bernstein, have decided to allow their father's music to be played at the Kennedy Center despite concerns over President Trump's influence on the institution. They believe their father would want his music to be heard, as he strived to embrace and unite humanity through his works. They note that Bernstein often faced pressure to modify his artistic activity but consistently chose to play music, believing in its power to transcend violence and hate. The proceeds from upcoming Kennedy Center performances will be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks is gaining traction, bolstered by support from President Trump and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Recent stock trades by lawmakers around tariff announcements have raised concerns about insider trading. Proposals would prohibit lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks, requiring them to shift to blind trusts or mutual funds. The issue has broad public support, but faces resistance from some members who are hesitant to give up the ability to make money.</p>

          <p>American shoppers will soon face higher prices on Shein and Temu due to the end of a legal loophole that exempted tariffs on low-value packages shipped from China. The Trump administration implemented the change to combat fentanyl trafficking. This means that import duties will now be applied to each item, potentially doubling the cost of some orders. The move is expected to impact the business models of Shein and Temu, which rely on direct shipping from Chinese suppliers to offer low prices. Trade enforcement experts warn of potential delays as customs officials transition to more rigorous vetting standards.</p>

Economic factors, such as gas prices and the cost of housing, also play a role in their support. However, some Asian Americans express concerns about Trump's deportation policies and their potential impact on family members seeking citizenship.</p>
