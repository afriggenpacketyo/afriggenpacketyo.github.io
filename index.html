          <p>San Diego FC has issued indefinite bans to 33 fans involved in a violent brawl after their match against the LA Galaxy at Snapdragon Stadium. The club is working with law enforcement and MLS to enforce these bans, and further action is possible. The club stated that the behavior of these individuals is unacceptable and does not reflect the club's values of creating a safe and respectful environment. This incident adds to previous issues this season, including fights at a match against Los Angeles FC and homophobic chants during the inaugural home match, despite the team's successful season on the field. The club aims to foster a passionate, inclusive, and secure atmosphere for all fans, emphasizing that violence has no place in the sport.</p>

          <p>A proposed 3.5% tax on remittances from the U.S. by non-citizens, part of President Trump's tax bill, is drawing criticism for its potential impact on African economies. Remittances, financial transfers to home countries, are a vital source of income for many African families, often used for essential expenses like food, education, and healthcare. World Bank data indicates that remittance flows to Africa exceeded $92 billion in 2024, with the U.S. being a significant contributor. Experts argue that the tax could drive migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, and that the policy is part of the Trump administration's campaign against illegal migration.

          <p>An inquiry is underway in Australia to investigate how Joel Cauchi, a man with a long history of mental illness, was able to fatally stab six people and injure 10 others at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping center. The inquiry is scrutinizing Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attack, seeking to identify missed opportunities for intervention. The inquest heard that Cauchi was once a bright young man who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 and later stopped taking his medication, leading to a deterioration in his mental health. The family of Jade Young, one of the victims, described her death as the result of cumulative failures within multiple systems.</p>

Trump also announced plans to increase tariffs on steel imports to 50%, citing national security concerns.

The US president announced the US-UK trade deal earlier this month from the Oval Office, calling it “very special for the UK and special for the United States”.

Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, more travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The shift is partly driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, many of whom have visited Japan before, now choosing family trips over group tours. The JNTO is working to better target this market, including opening an account on a popular Chinese social media platform last fall.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that talks with U.S. Cabinet members are progressing towards a potential tariff deal as early as June. Akazawa emphasized Japan's demand for the U.S. to remove all additional tariffs on Japanese imports, but noted that another round of negotiations is planned before the G7 summit. The discussions include boosting Japan-U.S. cooperation on strategic sectors like semiconductors and rare earths, in addition to addressing trade and nontariff barriers. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with President Trump, highlighting the need for a win-win relationship through increased Japanese investment in the U.S., rather than tariffs.</p>
