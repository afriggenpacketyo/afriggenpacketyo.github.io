        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by the President and the FCC Chairman to revoke broadcast licenses of networks perceived as biased have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. Broadcast networks like ABC and NBC require government-issued licenses to use public airwaves, obligating them to serve the "public interest." While this authority has historically been used for issues like obscenity or children's programming, legal experts note that using it to punish political speech is unprecedented and would likely face significant legal challenges under the First Amendment. The controversy has also drawn attention to potential consolidation in the local TV station market, which requires FCC approval.</p>

          <p>Remnants of Tropical Storm Mario have caused severe mudslides in the San Bernardino Mountains, battering communities like Forest Falls and leaving residents without power. The debris flows, exacerbated by recent wildfire burn scars, have submerged vehicles, damaged homes, and blocked roads with boulders and trees. One resident described his neighbor barely escaping as mud "blasted through" his home, destroying the structure. In a moment of hope amid the destruction, community members and a county supervisor successfully rescued a dog named Daisy that was trapped inside a destroyed house, reuniting her with her traumatized owner.</p>

          <p>Veteran supermodel David Gandy has joined over 2,000 other models in calling for UK government regulation of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He warns that AI-generated models, which are already being used in campaigns, pose an existential threat by making human models, photographers, and makeup artists redundant. Gandy, who rose to fame as the face of Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue fragrance, expresses concern that this trend undermines the artistry of fashion photography. He also worries about the mental health impact on young people who may aspire to unrealistic, non-human beauty standards.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan long-distance runner, Evans Kibet, has appeared in a video released by the Ukrainian army, claiming he was tricked into joining the Russian military. Kibet, now a prisoner-of-war, states he traveled to Russia to compete in races but was unknowingly made to sign military papers before being sent to a training camp with no choice but to fight. He asserts he never engaged in combat and surrendered to Ukrainian soldiers to save his life. His family in Kenya is in shock but relieved he is alive, and they are appealing to the Kenyan government for his repatriation.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has informed his staff of his intention to resign following pressure from the administration to file criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Despite a five-month investigation into mortgage fraud allegations, investigators reportedly found insufficient evidence to prosecute James, a prominent political adversary of the President. The President publicly confirmed he wanted Siebert "out," citing his nomination's support from Democratic senators. Critics have described the move as a "brazen attack on the rule of law" and an escalation of using the Justice Department for political retribution.</p>

          <p>Russia has revived a Soviet-era song contest called Intervision, presenting it as an alternative to the Eurovision Song Contest from which it was banned following the invasion of Ukraine. The event, backed by the Kremlin, features participants from 23 allied nations across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reflecting Russia's political alliances. Officials frame the contest as a celebration of culture and tradition, while critics, particularly in Ukraine, view it as a propaganda tool to whitewash its aggression and project an image of international support. The contest aims to showcase a different cultural and geopolitical map, distinct from the Western-centric Eurovision.</p>

He emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for six seasons. His new film, "Steve," sees him play a headteacher at a 1990s reform school, a role he describes as part of a "love letter to teachers" and their role as custodians of the next generation.</p>

The panel also voted against requiring a prescription for the vaccine to avoid creating access barriers.

          <p>Canada's women's rugby team delivered a stunning upset, defeating the six-time world champion New Zealand Black Ferns to advance to the World Cup final. The victory ended New Zealand's 11-year undefeated streak in the tournament and marked their first loss in a knockout game since 1991. Canada, who had to fundraise to even attend the tournament, dominated the first half and held on for a decisive win. Commentators described the result as a "seismic" and "fairytale" moment for Canadian rugby, setting them up for a final against either France or England at Twickenham.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Recent CDC Panel Decisions Could Create a Two-Tier Vaccine System</h2>

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's advisory committee, newly appointed by the administration, risk creating a two-tiered system for childhood vaccinations in the U.S. By removing the combined MMRV vaccine from the recommended schedule and the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, the panel has created a situation where privately insured families may still access the convenient single shot while poorer families cannot. This article argues that further changes could exacerbate these disparities. The VFC program was created specifically to prevent such inequities after a measles outbreak disproportionately affected low-income children in the past.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has thrown out President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint was "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the filing for its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail" that went far beyond the legal requirement for a "simple, concise and direct" statement of the case. The President's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint with a 40-page limit. The lawsuit targets the newspaper and four of its reporters over their extensive coverage of his career and presidency.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $2.6 billion expansion of its downtown Convention Center, despite warnings from its own policy analysts about significant financial risks. The project is expected to draw an average of $89 million annually from the city's general fund for 30 years, potentially impacting essential services like police and fire departments. Proponents, including the mayor, argue the expansion is crucial for boosting tourism and creating jobs, especially with the 2028 Olympic Games approaching. However, critics, including the City Controller, caution that the project is unaffordable and may not be completed in time for the Olympics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 100 members of the Writers Guild of America East protested outside Disney's headquarters, condemning ABC's decision to pull "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" as an attack on free speech. The demonstrators argued that the network's action was a form of censorship and a capitulation to political pressure from the FCC and the President. Union representatives expressed concern that threatening a network's broadcast license over content could create a chilling effect across all of broadcast television, potentially leading to self-censorship on any topic deemed controversial by the administration. The protest reflects growing anger within the creative community over the suspension.</p>
