          <p>China's ruling Communist Party has initiated its fourth plenum, a significant closed-door political meeting of the Central Committee, according to state media. The event is taking place in Beijing amid a notable increase in security measures, particularly around the Jingxi Hotel, a traditional venue for such high-level gatherings. Observers noted an unusually large presence of traffic police and cordoned-off areas near the hotel, indicating the secretive and sensitive nature of the political discussions expected to unfold over the coming days.</p>

          <p>A posthumously published memoir by Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, reveals her profound fear of dying as a "sex slave" within his circle of influence. The book, titled "Nobody's Girl," details harrowing accounts of sadistic abuse and exploitation by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. It also reiterates her claims of being forced into sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, placing further scrutiny on the British royal, who has consistently denied the allegations and reached a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called V-levels for students in England after they complete their GCSEs. These courses are intended to replace existing Level 3 BTECs and other technical qualifications, aiming to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 education. Alongside V-levels, the government also plans to create an alternative qualification for students who need to resit maths and English, reducing the number of direct GCSE retakes and offering different pathways for students.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was severely tested after Israel launched a series of retaliatory airstrikes, stating the action was a response to a Hamas attack that killed two of its soldiers. The Israeli military reported hitting multiple Hamas targets with aircraft and artillery, and the government temporarily halted aid deliveries into the territory. While Hamas denied involvement in the initial clashes, the escalation resulted in at least 38 reported deaths in Gaza, raising significant concerns about the viability of the ongoing peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced talks to hire former Everton and Burnley manager Sean Dyche. The move follows the swift dismissal of Ange Postecoglou just 17 minutes after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, which left the club in the relegation zone. Dyche has emerged as the leading candidate to take over at the struggling club, which has already seen two managers sacked this season. The club hopes to finalize the appointment as it seeks stability and a change in fortune on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay demonstrated remarkable adaptability in his team's 35-7 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, despite the absence of star receiver Puka Nacua.

This tactical shift proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw five touchdown passes on fewer than 200 yards, showcasing McVay's ability to innovate and succeed even when missing a key offensive player.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 4.8% in the third quarter compared to the previous year, a figure in line with analysts' expectations and keeping the nation on track for its annual growth target. However, the data revealed a concerning and unexpected contraction in fixed-asset investment, which fell by 0.5% in the first nine months of the year, driven by a persistent slump in the property sector. This rare decline in investment, particularly from the private sector, signals a lack of confidence and poses a significant risk to future economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California Highway Patrol vehicle was damaged by falling shrapnel from a 155mm artillery round during a U.S. Marine Corps live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton. The event, held to celebrate the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, involved firing ordnance over the heavily trafficked Interstate 5 freeway, which had been temporarily closed. According to the CHP, the round detonated prematurely overhead, causing the incident which resulted in no injuries but prompted the immediate cancellation of further live-fire exercises over the public roadway and calls for a safety review.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated tensions with Colombia, threatening to impose tariffs and slash U.S. assistance to the long-standing ally. In a social media post, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of being an "illegal drug leader" and failing to curb drug production, warning of harsh U.S. intervention. The Colombian government vehemently rejected the accusations as a threat to its sovereignty.

This protein is also found in humans, and the scientists' findings suggest that the mechanism could inspire new therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan. Naked mole-rats can live up to 37 years, an extraordinary length for a rodent of their size, making them a key subject for aging research.

While the stand did not have a direct line of sight to Air Force One's recent location and no individuals were present, the discovery prompted an official response and heightened security awareness in the area.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in the case against former FBI Director James Comey have indicated they may seek to remove his lead defense attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, due to a potential conflict of interest. The issue stems from Fitzgerald's alleged role in helping Comey disclose information to the media following his dismissal by President Trump in 2017. Prosecutors have asked a judge to approve a "filter team" to review evidence that could clarify Fitzgerald's involvement without breaching attorney-client privilege, raising questions about his ability to continue representing Comey in the current criminal case.</p>
