        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou merely 39 days into his role, establishing a new record for the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The dismissal was prompted by a string of poor results, culminating in a 3-0 loss to Chelsea, which left the club just one point above the relegation zone. Postecoglou failed to secure a single victory in his eight matches in charge across all competitions, leading to his swift removal by club owner Evangelos Marinakis. The club is now reportedly considering candidates like Sean Dyche for a quick appointment to stabilize the team's performance.</p>

          <p>A Cameroonian-flagged tanker loaded with liquefied petroleum gas is ablaze in the Gulf of Aden after being struck by an unknown projectile, forcing the crew to abandon the vessel. One mariner is reported missing, while another may still be on board the burning ship. British military intelligence suggested a projectile hit the ship, whereas an EU naval force indicated the fire might have been accidental, warning that the fully loaded vessel could explode. The incident heightens maritime security concerns in a region where Houthi rebel attacks on shipping have become frequent, although no group has yet claimed responsibility for this event.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, actor Michael J. Fox recounts the grueling period in 1985 when he worked on both the sitcom "Family Ties" and the film "Back to the Future" at the same time. He describes enduring 20-hour workdays, filming the TV show during the day and the movie at night, which left him with almost no personal time or sleep. The article highlights the immense physical and mental strain he was under, relying on drivers to get him home while he slept in the car. Fox also reveals that the film's crew, concerned for his safety, intervened to prevent him from performing a particularly dangerous stunt involving a car.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent market turbulence, some financial experts are highlighting income funds that utilize options-based strategies as a potential haven for risk-averse investors. Invesco's senior portfolio manager, John Burrello, suggests these ETFs offer more structural protection because their performance is not solely reliant on stock correlations and can provide income that isn't sensitive to interest rate changes. He notes that with an expected rate-cutting cycle, finding income sources independent of Federal Reserve policy is becoming increasingly important. The article mentions specific funds like the Invesco QQQ Income Advantage ETF as examples of this defensive investment approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gaza's civil defence, run by Hamas, reported that an Israeli tank shell struck a bus in northern Gaza, killing eleven people from the same family. The incident occurred in the Zeitoun neighbourhood as the family was reportedly attempting to inspect their home during the ongoing ceasefire. The Israeli military stated its soldiers fired on a "suspicious vehicle" that crossed into an area occupied by its forces and posed an imminent threat. This event marks the deadliest single incident involving Israeli troops in Gaza since the ceasefire began, highlighting the fragility of the truce and the dangers civilians face.</p>

          <p>Dozens of people were injured in Kisumu, Kenya, during a public viewing for the late opposition leader and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga. The injuries occurred when large crowds surged forward to see the coffin at Jomo Kenyatta Stadium, causing scuffles and stampedes. This follows earlier incidents where at least five people died during other funeral events in Nairobi, including a stampede at his state funeral. The chaotic scenes underscore the deep public grief for Odinga, a major figure in Kenyan politics for decades, as security personnel struggled to manage the massive turnout of mourners.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets recovered this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting gains despite initial worries over regional bank stability. Strong quarterly earnings from major institutions like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs bolstered investor confidence, though disclosures of bad loans from Zions and Western Alliance briefly sparked a selloff in financial stocks. The market ultimately interpreted these loan issues as isolated incidents rather than signs of a systemic crisis. The week also saw industrial firms Honeywell and DuPont release details about their upcoming spinoffs, while Salesforce provided an optimistic long-term revenue forecast during its Dreamforce event.

          <p>The expression "Das crazy," a mix of German and English, has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year. The phrase is used by young people to express surprise, speechlessness, or to make an ironic comment, often when they are unsure how to respond in a conversation. Selected through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the term reflects the significant influence of English on modern German youth slang and a trend toward linguistic brevity. The grammatically unconventional phrase, which originated in internet meme culture, beat out other contenders like "goonen" in a vote that saw two million participants.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) following shareholder backlash against the company's planned merger with JDE Peet's. Investors were critical of the deal's structure, which involves an all-cash acquisition financed by a large loan, seen as highly favorable to JAB Holdings, a major shareholder in both companies. Starboard, known for its operational expertise, is expected to seek board representation and help restore investor confidence. This situation is similar to Starboard's past involvement with Ritchie Bros Auctioneer, where the firm's engagement helped stabilize the company after a contentious merger announcement.

The new map targets the district of longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II in Kansas City.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible, ideally until age 16, to promote better mental health outcomes. To prepare them, she advises starting conversations about responsible technology use as early as late elementary school. Key lessons include teaching the importance of privacy, understanding that online content is permanent, and valuing time spent on real-world interactions. Twenge also stresses the need for firm rules, such as using parental controls, banning phones from bedrooms overnight, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to build healthy habits early.</p>

Launched from his Bronx apartment, the company is now profitable, with its coats sold in over 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has directed airlines to disregard the "X" gender marker on passports for international travel and instead input either "M" for male or "F" for female.

While the passports themselves remain valid due to a court order, the policy creates uncertainty about potential processing issues, delays, and invasive questioning at border control.

          <p>In a detailed explanation of his investment philosophy, Warren Buffett categorizes assets into three types: currency-denominated, non-productive, and productive. He expresses skepticism towards gold, a classic non-productive asset, arguing that its value relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future, rather than on any intrinsic ability to generate output. Buffett illustrates that all the world's gold would fit into a small cube that produces nothing, contrasting it with productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate tangible value over time. He concludes that his focus remains on acquiring assets that deliver real returns. (not investment advice)</p>

This trend is attributed to their generation coming of age amidst crises like climate change, economic instability, and the erosion of reproductive rights.
