          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, proposing changes to tax and Medicaid provisions that differ significantly from the House-passed bill. Key sticking points include Medicaid funding cuts, the state and local tax deduction (SALT), and an increase in the debt ceiling, with the Senate version proposing a permanent extension of the $10,000 SALT deduction, while the House seeks to raise it to $40,000. The Senate bill also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while increasing the Child Tax Credit to $2,200, setting the stage for negotiations between the House and Senate to reach a compromise before the July 4 deadline. Republican leaders aim to get the legislation to the president's desk by early July, but disagreements over key provisions could complicate the process. (not investment advice)</p>

Boelter allegedly shot state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, and then fatally shot state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home. Authorities found a notebook in Boelter's vehicle containing the names and addresses of over 45 Minnesota state and federal elected officials, as well as information on abortion providers.</p>

          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom, while standing next to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump briefly fumbled the document, blaming the wind, and mistakenly stated the agreement was with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom, and Trump indicated there were few substantial differences between this agreement and one signed in May. The agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff.</p>

The announcement came shortly after Trump posted a warning on social media regarding the conflict, urging people to evacuate Tehran. Prior to his departure, Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to discuss trade issues. Trump reiterated that Iran needed to agree to end its nuclear program and indicated that Iran had sent messages through intermediaries expressing a desire to de-escalate the conflict with Israel.</p>

Kennedy also reversed a recommendation for administering Covid shots to healthy children and pregnant women. Havers stated that the data her team collected had been used in numerous peer-reviewed publications and CDC reports.</p>

Qolian, who was active in the Women, Life, Freedom movement, believes Netanyahu is not a champion of the movement's values, and she blames Iran's aggressive policies for the country's predicament. Other Iranian activists share similar sentiments, opposing both the current regime and the Israeli strikes, fearing societal collapse and the destruction of Iran's infrastructure. Nobel laureates Shirin Ebadi and Narges Mohammadi, along with other activists, have called for an immediate end to the war and a democratic transition in Iran.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are heading to Miami to try to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada for the first time since 1993, but face concerns that history could repeat itself after losing to the Florida Panthers on Saturday. Repeated losses have united Canadians, who are known for their die-hard fans, against a common enemy – the US, especially amidst heightened tensions between Canada and the US due to a testy trade war. Many Canadians have different hypotheses as to why Canadian teams have not won the Cup since 1993, from mild temperatures and lucrative tax breaks in many US states, to the NHL's focus on expanding American franchises.</p>

Lindell's lawyers denied the claims, arguing his platform is not liable for statements made by others, and Lindell stated he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines.

          <p>A former In-N-Out Burger employee is suing the company for at least $3 million, alleging racial discrimination related to the company's dress code. Elijah Obeng, who is Black, claims he experienced severe emotional distress after being unfairly targeted by the burger chain’s dress code, which requires employees to wear company-issued hats and male employees to be clean-shaven. Obeng alleges that he was treated differently at work after resisting orders to shave his sideburns, and was eventually fired for not complying. The suit claims that In-N-Out violated the CROWN Act, which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of an employee’s hairstyle or hair texture.</p>

          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving his sentence. Mizuhara was sentenced to 57 months in prison for stealing nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts. In addition to the prison sentence, Mizuhara was ordered to pay $16.9 million in restitution to Ohtani and another $1.1 million to the IRS. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting that he placed about 19,000 bets with a bookie over a two-year period and accumulated over $40 million in debt.</p>

Rainbow Brite and her litter were taken to the Lazin Animal Foundation Trauma Hospital, where Rainbow Brite's temperature was found to be dangerously high, and she was underweight. The family of ten will soon be available for adoption after being placed with a foster family.</p>

          <p>A survey published by Shell reveals that drivers are becoming more hesitant to switch to electric vehicles (EVs) from combustion engines, with this trend being more pronounced in Europe than in the United States. The primary obstacle to switching is cost, with EVs being on average up to 30% more expensive than internal combustion engine cars. In Europe, 41% of respondents said they would consider switching to an electric car, compared to 48% last year, while in the United States the number fell to 31%. Additionally, only 17% of European drivers believe public charging offers value for money, compared to 69% in China and 71% in the United States.</p>

The ABA argues that the Trump administration's gambit has led to a "chilling effect," intimidating some law firms into not taking pro bono cases that run counter to the Trump administration's agenda.
