          <p>Health authorities are monitoring a significant surge in Chikungunya fever cases in China, with over 5,000 infections reported, primarily in the southern Guangdong province. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering issuing a travel notice in response. Chikungunya is a virus transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and its most common symptoms include fever and severe joint pain, though it can also cause headaches, rashes, and muscle pain. This article explains the nature of the disease and the context of its recent spread in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major economic pillars in China's Guangdong province, are experiencing a notable slowdown in GDP growth compared to their peers. Analysts attribute this underperformance to a combination of weakening global demand, a domestic property downturn, and insufficient local consumption to offset the shortfalls. In Shenzhen, fixed-asset investment and real estate development have seen significant declines, reflecting diminished investor confidence despite growth in its hi-tech sectors. This trend has prompted calls for stronger government action to revitalize business activity in these crucial economic engines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order confirming new "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous countries, with duty rates ranging from 10% to 41%. A significant new measure imposes a 40% tariff on all goods determined to have been transshipped to circumvent existing duties. Countries not specifically listed in the order will face a default additional duty of 10% on their goods. These modified rates are scheduled to take effect seven days after the order's issuance, formalizing a key part of the administration's trade policy.</p>

          <p>During a state legislative hearing, the emergency manager for Kerr County, William B. Thomas, testified that he was sick and asleep when catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas on July 4, killing at least 135 people. His absence during the initial hours of the disaster has raised serious questions about the county's preparedness and response speed. The hearing also featured harrowing testimony from survivors who described the rapidly rising waters and their desperate escapes. The floods were particularly devastating along the Guadalupe River, where many victims were campers and staff at a youth camp.</p>

          <p>Following the recent death of wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has designated August 1 as "Hulk Hogan Day in Florida." The governor's memorandum called for flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of the 71-year-old, who was a longtime Florida resident. Hogan, whose real name was Terry Bollea, passed away from a heart attack and had been dealing with other health issues, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DeSantis's proclamation celebrates Hogan as a cultural icon for multiple generations and a "true Floridian through and through."</p>

Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. This move is part of a broader initiative to establish more career paths into the senior civil service outside of London and follows critiques of the institution's perceived lack of diversity.</p>

Newsom framed his plan as a defensive measure to counter what he called an attempt to "rig the game."

          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a massive 250% stock price increase on its first day of trading, creating a paper windfall of approximately $24 billion for its four main venture capital backers. The successful IPO is a bright spot for Silicon Valley, which has seen a prolonged drought in major tech public offerings. The deal almost didn't happen, as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed last year due to regulatory pressure. Now valued at nearly $68 billion, Figma's market debut signals renewed investor appetite for tech IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the company's stock fell after it issued a lighter-than-expected operating income forecast for the current quarter, raising investor concerns about the costs of its heavy investments in artificial intelligence. Key segments like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising showed solid growth, with AWS revenue climbing 18%. CEO Andy Jassy reassured investors about the company's AI progress and its leadership position in the competitive cloud market. (not investment advice)</p>

The Mac division also saw robust growth, while the services unit continued its steady climb. Despite these positive results, Apple anticipates facing about $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in the upcoming quarter, though it still projects continued revenue growth.

          <p>The presidential fitness test, a school-based assessment of physical fitness, is being revived by the Trump administration. Originally initiated by President Eisenhower in 1956 over concerns about the physical preparedness of American youth compared to Europeans, the test typically included exercises like a one-mile run, sit-ups, and pull-ups. The program was later phased out, and this article examines its history and purpose. It also notes that recent data indicates U.S. children's health trends have worsened significantly since the test was first introduced, raising questions about its potential effectiveness.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic analyzes the underlying motivations of President Trump's trade policy, arguing that it has shifted from a promised "America First" realpolitik to a form of "warped idealism." Instead of focusing purely on economic benefits, the administration is using tariffs to achieve non-economic goals, such as pressuring Brazil over the prosecution of an ally or punishing Canada for its stance on Palestinian statehood. This approach is described as a betrayal of his original pact with voters and a move that could ultimately backfire on U.S. interests and global standing.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a high-yield savings account and a money market account for a $20,000 deposit. In the current elevated interest rate environment, both options offer strong returns. Based on current average rates, a high-yield savings account would earn slightly more over a one-year period than a money market account due to a marginally higher interest rate. However, the article notes that the difference is minimal and savers should also consider other features, such as the check-writing capabilities often available with money market accounts.
