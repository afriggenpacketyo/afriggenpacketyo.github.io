          <p>Glastonbury Festival organizers have publicly stated they are "appalled" by comments made by the punk duo Bob Vylan during their performance. The group's frontman led chants calling for "death to the IDF," prompting the festival to issue a statement condemning hate speech and incitement to violence. The BBC, which broadcast the set, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service, while local police are reviewing footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <p>A major legislative bill supported by former President Donald Trump has cleared a crucial procedural hurdle in the Senate with a 51-49 vote. Republican supporters have framed the bill as a necessary step towards fiscal responsibility, while Democrats have criticized it as a radical proposal rushed through without proper scrutiny. Following the vote, Trump praised the Republican senators who supported the measure, outlining his vision for its impact on the economy, border security, and other key areas of his platform.</p>

This potential visit in September could mark the first in-person meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during Trump's second term. The invitation is seen as a significant diplomatic overture, although the article notes it could face opposition from some U.S. officials and is complicated by ongoing bilateral tensions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government was compelled to make significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to prevent a large-scale rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the initial proposals were mishandled and that the subsequent changes, which include protecting disability payments for existing claimants, have improved the legislation. The U-turn came after more than 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the bill, arguing the planned cuts would harm vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>A Supreme Court decision limiting the use of nationwide injunctions has significant implications for President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the ruling allows the administration to begin implementing the policy in the 28 states that have not joined lawsuits against it. This development creates a complex legal landscape where citizenship status could vary by state, pending further litigation on the merits of the case.</p>

It draws a parallel to how the Obama administration used Title IX to address sexual assault on campus, arguing both approaches have led to an overreach of federal power and illiberal outcomes. The author contends that this aggressive enforcement style, regardless of political party, threatens academic freedom and creates a dysfunctional cycle of policy reversals with each new administration.</p>

Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon argues that while BNPL offers convenience, it also points to a "poor-impulse-control economy" and serves as a psychological buffer for consumers who feel excluded from traditional financial stability.</p>

          <p>With no confirmed director, the CDC is effectively being run by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., giving him direct authority over key public health decisions like vaccine recommendations. Legal experts express concern over this arrangement, citing Kennedy's history of anti-vaccine activism and recent controversial moves, such as replacing the entire independent vaccine advisory committee. This situation has created confusion and raises the potential for legal challenges to the agency's actions.</p>

V emphasizes the power of community, collective action like marches, and caring for one another as essential acts of building a new, more humane world.</p>

The number of alpha-gal cases has surged from a few dozen in 2009 to potentially 450,000, and researchers expect this number to continue growing as the tick's habitat expands.</p>
