          <p>China's industrial profits fell by 9.1% in May year-over-year, marking the most significant drop since last October. The National Bureau of Statistics cited insufficient domestic demand and declining prices for industrial products as primary causes for the downturn. Despite mixed economic data, with retail sales showing growth, economists suggest that Beijing may delay further stimulus measures. The decline affects various sectors, including a 29% profit drop in mining and an 11.9% decrease in automotive manufacturing, highlighting persistent economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

While soil tests in some burn scars showed elevated lead levels, community blood screenings have so far revealed low levels of contamination in most residents.

          <p>Microsoft is officially retiring its iconic "Blue Screen of Death," the notorious error message that has signaled critical system failures on Windows for over four decades. The company announced that the error screen will now feature a black background as part of a broader effort to improve system resilience and streamline the user experience during unexpected restarts. The new, simplified screen will display more condensed text and will be rolled out on all Windows 11 (version 24H2) devices later this summer, marking the end of a well-known, if often frustrating, era in personal computing.</p>

A prosecutor argued that Combs used "violence, power and fear" to control his victims, including two ex-girlfriends who testified he coerced them into filmed sexual encounters with male escorts. The government contends that this pattern of behavior, supported by a close circle of employees, constitutes sex trafficking and racketeering. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, depending on the progress of ongoing trade negotiations with key partners like Japan. This comes as Japan's top negotiator is in Washington for another round of talks.

          <p>Nike has announced that it anticipates new U.S. tariffs will add approximately $1 billion in costs during its 2026 fiscal year. To counteract this, the company plans to shift its supply chain, collaborate with partners, and implement price increases over time. A key part of this strategy involves reducing its manufacturing in China from 16% of its supply chain to the high single-digits. Despite this challenge and a reported 86% drop in quarterly profits, Nike's stock rose as its overall performance beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's vice president of manufacturing and operations, amid declining car sales in key markets. Afshar, who reported directly to Musk, led a large team responsible for areas including North American sales and operations in Europe. His termination follows a 2022 internal investigation into his conduct and comes as Tesla's stock has underperformed this year. The company has faced significant challenges, including increased competition and brand damage attributed to Musk's political activities and rhetoric. (not investment advice)</p>
