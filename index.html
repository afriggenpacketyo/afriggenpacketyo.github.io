          <h2>House Republicans Introduce Medicaid Cuts, Sparking Healthcare Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 02:18:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have revealed a plan to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid, aiming to offset $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, which is part of President Trump's initiative. Democrats are warning that this will leave millions without healthcare coverage, with a CBO estimate suggesting 8.6 million people could lose their health insurance over the next decade. The proposed changes include stricter eligibility requirements, work mandates, and the rolling back of Biden-era green energy programs, leading to a contentious political battle over healthcare access and affordability. The GOP argues these measures eliminate waste and ensure program integrity, while Democrats decry them as an attack on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced the impending release of Edan Alexander, a U.S. citizen held hostage since October 7, 2023, as part of ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza, potentially influenced by mediation efforts from Qatar and Egypt. The release is framed as a gesture of goodwill ahead of President Trump's planned visit to the Middle East, with Hamas expressing hope for a comprehensive agreement to end the war and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office acknowledged the expected release, they maintained that military operations would continue, and preparations for intensified fighting were still underway. The Alexander family expressed gratitude to President Trump and urged continued efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages.</p>

Meanwhile, South Korea's presidential election campaign has begun, and Japan's corporate bankruptcies for April have reached an 11-year high due to labor shortages and funding difficulties.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to establish a trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns following ministerial-level talks in Geneva. While the White House has described the outcome as a "China trade deal" and cited "substantial progress," Chinese officials have been more reserved, promising a joint statement on Monday. Analysts suggest the move provides interim political relief for both powers and marks the beginning of a long process toward addressing tariffs and other trade barriers. This development follows a period of heightened trade tensions, including significant tariff increases imposed by both countries.</p>

Both countries have claimed military victory, with India reporting strikes on targets inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while Pakistan claims to have targeted military facilities in India.

The article also discusses instances of missing gifts and the potential ethical concerns of accepting expensive items, such as a luxury plane, while in office, adding that foreign leaders often use gifts to strengthen relationships and break the ice.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks in Geneva, the U.S. announced a "deal" with China, while Chinese officials acknowledged "important consensus" and the establishment of a "consultation mechanism." The difference in framing highlights sensitivities surrounding trade between the two largest economies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," and markets reacted positively, though analysts warn of potential disappointment if tariffs aren't significantly reduced. The negotiations mark a significant attempt to ease tensions after President Trump imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to a trade slowdown and global economic concerns.</p>

The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct studies on the potential return of these "keystone" species, which can help create and maintain habitats for diverse wildlife. Key challenges include disease risk assessment and public acceptance, drawing lessons from the successful reintroduction of beavers. The initial plan involves keeping elk and beavers in the same enclosure before potentially releasing elk into the Trent valley.</p>

The move follows Carla Denyer's announcement that she will not seek re-election as co-leader. Ramsay and Chowns aim to lead the party into its most ambitious chapter, focusing on national politics in Westminster and winning power across the country. Polanski emphasizes the need to build a mass movement to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. The Green Party recently achieved its best-ever result in the general election, winning seats in four constituencies.</p>

          <p>This article discusses a student-led movement in Serbia protesting against the increasingly autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic. It describes an Easter miracle in which Muslim students from Novi Pazar joined the protests to support their Christian colleagues, and a war veteran's message of inclusion that resonated deeply. The movement, sparked by corruption related to a train station collapse, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in Serbian society. Despite government attempts to defang them, protesters are calling for early elections, demonstrating a commitment to change the country through horizontal decision-making and solidarity.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. This decision comes ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid. The release requires a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover. The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Mr Alexander's release.</p>

          <p>House Republicans unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of President Donald Trump's “ big, beautiful bill ” late Sunday, at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.</p>
