          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged by over 16% to a nine-year high following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea. The company, which acquired Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, is expected to play a significant role in revitalizing the U.S. shipbuilding industry. This stock rally is also supported by a substantial increase in Hanwha's second-quarter operating profits and a series of new orders and global expansion initiatives, including a new engineering center in India. These developments position the company for stronger global competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals the significant challenge UK authorities face in combating organized crime gangs involved in the sale of illegal tobacco and vapes. In Newport, South Wales, 19 shops on a single street were shut down in nine months, yet many quickly reopen or relocate, with criminal activities including the use of forced labor and open drug dealing. Residents report feeling unsafe due to intimidation and associated criminality. Despite thousands of seizures nationwide, local councils have limited power to permanently close these establishments, highlighting legislative gaps and resource constraints in tackling this persistent issue.</p>

          <p>Shanghai-based Wuxi AppTec successfully raised US$981 million through a new share placement in Hong Kong, reflecting strong investor appetite for Chinese biotechnology companies. The company sold 73.8 million new shares to institutional investors, with the proceeds intended to fund global expansion and enhance production capacity. This move follows a trend of other Chinese drug developers, such as Innovent Biologics and Ascentage Pharma, tapping into capital markets for growth. The bullish sentiment is reportedly driven by mainland investors purchasing shares of Hong Kong-listed Chinese pharmaceutical firms, signaling confidence in the sector's long-term potential.

          <p>Democrats in Texas are strongly opposing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, labeling it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" gerrymander. The plan aims to make five currently Democratic-held House districts more favorable to the GOP, a move supported by President Trump to bolster the party's narrow majority in Congress. Critics argue the map intentionally fractures Black and Latino voting communities to dilute their representation, potentially violating the Voting Rights Act. The controversy in Texas could trigger similar partisan redistricting efforts in other states, escalating political tensions ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

Her winning piece is a portrait of Aboriginal musician William Barton, which she created by painting with her fingers due to a nerve injury that made holding a brush painful. Spirovski stated that this method allowed her to paint almost without pain and that she felt creatively reinvigorated during the process. The award, determined by public vote, celebrates her resilience and unique artistic approach, offering a poignant story of overcoming physical adversity through creative expression.</p>

          <p>India has shown a measured response to the US announcement of a 25% tariff and an additional penalty on its imports, opting not to rush into a trade agreement. A key reason for this resistance is the protection of its agricultural sector, a sensitive issue for a large voting bloc of local farmers, which India has successfully shielded in other trade negotiations. Analysts suggest India's position is strengthened because its exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy. Furthermore, India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, advancing trade talks with the UK, EU, and others to diversify its economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>A jury in Arapahoe County, Colorado, has convicted dentist James Craig of first-degree murder for poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, in 2023. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig used a lethal mix of arsenic, cyanide, and other substances in his wife's protein shakes. The motive was reportedly financial, involving a struggling dental practice and $4 million in life insurance policies, alongside extramarital affairs. Craig was also found guilty of soliciting an inmate to murder the lead investigator in his case, leading to an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>

This announcement underscores the significant effect of the U.S. administration's trade policies on major American corporations, even those with substantial domestic manufacturing.

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, but the risk for the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii has largely passed. While Hawaii experienced minor flooding and small waves, initial evacuation orders were lifted after the threat diminished. The quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, caused 16-foot waves and flooding in Russia's Far East. Tsunami advisories remained in effect longer for some parts of the U.S. coast and several South American countries, but major damage was avoided outside the immediate vicinity of the epicenter.</p>

          <p>With the MLB trade deadline approaching, several teams strengthened their bullpens through significant trades.

          <p>The Boring Company, led by Elon Musk, has announced a plan to build a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville, a project praised by Tennessee's Republican Governor Bill Lee. However, the proposal has sparked a partisan feud, with local Democratic lawmakers demanding more information on the project's operational, environmental, and financial impacts. The state is considering giving the company a no-cost lease on public land to facilitate the project, which would be privately funded. Concerns have been raised about the lack of public input and transparency surrounding the deal, especially given Nashville's susceptibility to flooding.</p>

          <p>Following an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles has restricted the construction of duplexes on single-family lots in Pacific Palisades. The area, which was devastated by a wildfire in January, is now exempt from Senate Bill 9, a state law intended to increase housing density. The decision comes after Palisades residents raised concerns that increased density would worsen evacuation dangers in the high-fire-risk zone. While officials have blocked SB 9 projects, they have simultaneously worked to streamline permitting for accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which have been a more popular option for homeowners rebuilding in the area.</p>

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution and civil rights violations. The dismissal was issued without prejudice, meaning his legal team can refile the claim within 30 days, which they plan to do if settlement talks are not resolved favorably. The original involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin was dismissed last year after new evidence emerged. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal when it discharged, killing her.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be less expensive, reduce risk, and could be fully operational by 2035 at a cost under £25 billion. This marks the first time a competing bid for the long-debated expansion has been formally submitted to the government for consideration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify examines the initial impacts of the Trump administration's new tariffs, which have raised the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level in nearly a century. While government tariff revenue has tripled, the U.S. trade deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling goods to avoid the tax. The tariffs have significantly reduced Chinese exports to the U.S. but have also spurred other nations to forge new trade deals among themselves. Economists are now seeing early signs that these import taxes are starting to increase U.S. consumer prices for certain goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the 4.25% to 4.5% range despite pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The decision came as new data showed the economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, though this was largely driven by a drop in imports due to new tariffs. In an unusual move, two board members dissented, preferring a rate cut, signaling a potential shift in sentiment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious, citing stable employment and tariff-related inflation risks as reasons to delay any changes. (not investment advice)</p>
