          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched a beta version of the 2026-27 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) earlier than anticipated. This early testing phase aims to identify and resolve technical issues that have impacted previous application cycles, hopefully leading to a smoother process for all students. Financial aid experts have praised the move, noting that an extended testing window provides crucial time for feedback and bug fixes before the form's full release in October. Completing the FAFSA is a critical step for students seeking federal loans, grants, and work-study programs.</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet is meeting to discuss the future of its military operations in the Gaza Strip, with reports suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may seek approval for a significant expansion, possibly including a full occupation. This potential escalation faces opposition from families of hostages still held in Gaza, who fear for the captives' safety. The situation is further complicated by a dire humanitarian crisis, with the World Health Organization reporting unprecedented levels of acute malnutrition among young children in the region. The conflict's death toll has reportedly surpassed 60,000, according to local officials.</p>

          <p>"Grey’s Anatomy" star Camilla Luddington has publicly shared her recent diagnosis with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. The 41-year-old actress described experiencing alarming symptoms, including severe fatigue, facial swelling, and joint pain, which significantly impaired her ability to function. Luddington explained that while the diagnosis was overwhelming, it also brought a sense of validation for her health concerns, which she had sometimes dismissed as anxiety. She expressed relief in having a clear treatment path and hopes her story can raise awareness about the common but challenging condition.</p>

          <p>Three individuals requiring medical attention were successfully evacuated from the American-operated McMurdo Station in Antarctica in a high-risk rescue mission. The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted the nearly 20-hour operation using a C-130J Hercules aircraft, navigating sub-zero temperatures and 24-hour winter darkness. U.S. officials praised the mission as "nothing short of heroic," highlighting the extreme challenge of landing on a manually prepared ice runway using night vision goggles. The aircraft's engines were kept running during the stop to prevent freezing before it returned safely to Christchurch, New Zealand with the patients.</p>

The company saw strong performance from its international division and at Tim Hortons, which reported a 3.4% rise in same-store sales. However, Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales amidst increased competition in the fast-food chicken market. Burger King's U.S. turnaround efforts continue, with a modest 1.5% sales increase as the chain renovates its restaurants.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a narrow 5-4 margin to reduce its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. This decision reflects the central bank's challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which rose unexpectedly to 3.6% in June, against signs of a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. Governor Andrew Bailey acknowledged the "finely balanced situation," noting upside risks to inflation but also softening labor conditions. The bank reiterated its commitment to a "gradual and careful" approach to further monetary easing, with future cuts dependent on disinflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO David Zaslav highlighted the studio's turnaround, crediting new leadership and a focus on major franchises like "Superman" and "Lord of the Rings."

Key allies like the UK, EU, and Japan have struck deals for lower rates, while countries such as Brazil and India are facing much higher duties of 50% due to specific administration concerns.

It notes that a recent poll shows 71% of Americans believe the list is real, a belief fueled by President Trump's past campaign pledges and the government's opaque handling of Epstein-related files. The author draws a parallel to the JFK assassination, where government secrecy and selective redactions have historically encouraged public speculation and distrust. The piece argues that because the government cannot definitively prove a negative, the theory is likely to endure indefinitely.</p>

It explains that while Social Security provides a foundational income, it is often insufficient on its own. Annuities are presented as an option for those seeking guaranteed lifetime income to bridge financial gaps, though they can come with high fees. Reverse mortgages allow homeowners to tap into their home equity but reduce their estate's value and are best for those planning to stay in their homes long-term.

          <p>While initially appearing chaotic, President Trump's recent wave of tariffs seems to follow a more coherent negotiating strategy than first perceived. The approach involves using the threat of steep tariffs to pressure countries into bilateral deals that include commitments to buy more U.S. goods or make significant investments. Nations that offer sufficient concessions, like the EU and Japan, receive a more favorable 15% tariff rate, while others face higher duties as a means of leverage.

          <p>Manchester United has agreed to a deal with German club RB Leipzig to sign 22-year-old Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko for a fee of £73.7 million. The deal includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3 million, with the rest structured as add-ons. Sesko, who has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig, is set to undergo a medical before finalizing the move. This acquisition is part of a significant summer spending spree for United, which has already signed forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, funding the moves through favorable payment structures and player sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's tariffs, despite being economically questionable and politically unpopular, may be difficult for future presidents to repeal. The primary reason is the substantial revenue they generate—projected to be $2.2 trillion over the next decade—effectively creating a major tax hike without a congressional vote. With the U.S. facing rising deficits, future administrations may be reluctant to eliminate such a significant revenue stream. Furthermore, the dynamic of concentrated benefits for specific industries and diffuse costs for consumers could create powerful special interest lobbying to keep the tariffs in place.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the economic argument for tariffs, suggesting that while President Trump's current policies are widely seen as broad and chaotic, tariffs themselves are not inherently bad policy tools. Economists argue that targeted, strategic tariffs can be effective in protecting nascent domestic industries from unfair competition, such as from state-subsidized foreign companies or those with poor labor standards. They can also be used to bolster supply chain security for critical goods, a lesson learned during the pandemic. The key, the article contends, is to use them as part of a complementary industrial policy rather than as a standalone solution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him "highly CONFLICTED" in a social media post without offering specific details. The call follows a letter from Republican Senator Tom Cotton to Intel's chairman, which raised concerns about Tan's alleged business ties to Chinese companies, including some with links to the Chinese military. The senator's letter referenced a case where a company previously led by Tan pleaded guilty to unlawfully exporting products to a Chinese military university.

          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered new evidence showing that some survivors of the catastrophic 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live amidst the ruins. Contrary to the belief that the city was completely abandoned, it appears a small, informal settlement emerged where people lived in "precarious conditions." These inhabitants repurposed the devastated structures, turning former ground floors into cellars with ovens and mills. Site director Gabriel Zuchtriegel described the reoccupied area as more of a "precarious and grey agglomeration" than a city, a finding that adds a new chapter to the famous site's story.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to cut its main interest rate to 4% will have varied effects on household finances. For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, monthly payments are expected to decrease, offering some financial relief. Conversely, savers will likely see returns on their accounts diminish further, as average savings rates are already falling. The rate cut aims to stimulate a sluggish economy and a weakening jobs market, but it could also contribute to inflation, which is currently above the Bank's 2% target. The move highlights the central bank's difficult balancing act between controlling prices and supporting growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Opposition politicians and renters' advocacy groups have condemned the action as indefensible for a minister responsible for homelessness, arguing it represents a clear conflict of interest.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that President Trump's broad tariff agenda is driven less by a rational economic development strategy and more by a powerful nostalgia for the post-World War II industrial economy. The author argues that the "America first" movement associates the high manufacturing employment of that era with a favored set of social conditions, including high wages and strong family structures. The tariffs are not targeted to strategically build high-value industries but rather to bring back all forms of manufacturing in an attempt to restore a past social order. The analysis concludes this is a fantasy, as economic shifts make it impossible.</p>

          <p>Switzerland was hit with a high 39% U.S. tariff, a rate largely influenced by its massive trade surplus with the United States, which is significantly distorted by its gold refining industry. While gold itself is exempt, the Trump administration included the full value of gold passing through Switzerland—billions of dollars annually—in its trade calculations. Swiss officials argue this is misleading, as refiners only earn a small processing fee, while the vast majority of the value belongs to the metal itself. This accounting has put non-gold Swiss industries in the position of bearing the brunt of tariffs caused by an unrelated sector.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Trump aimed at addressing homelessness is drawing sharp criticism from experts, who warn its vague language could lead to the widespread criminalization of unhoused people. The order instructs local governments to crack down on public camping and substance use and to shift people into "long-term institutional settings," a move critics call terrifying and harmful. Advocacy groups argue the order will do nothing to address the root causes of homelessness, such as the lack of affordable housing, and instead promotes punitive measures over proven solutions like "housing-first" policies.</p>
