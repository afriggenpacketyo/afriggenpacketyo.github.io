          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has elected conservative hard-liner Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a former economic security minister and an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, defeated Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. She advocates for strengthening Japan's military and adopting a more assertive stance toward China and North Korea. Her leadership comes as the party seeks to regain public support, and she may soon face a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss defense spending.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry faces significant hurdles in its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with its strategy heavily relying on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the EU and UK have mandated a small percentage of SAF use, supply and cost remain major concerns, leading figures like Ryanair's CEO to dismiss the targets as unrealistic. The article explores the challenges in scaling up SAF production, including investment risks, reliance on unproven technologies for next-generation fuels, and wavering government incentives, particularly in the US. Despite setbacks, some industry leaders remain committed, viewing SAF as the only viable path to decarbonization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an extraordinary endurance project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just over a month. The project, called "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the peaks and running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles across six states. The article chronicles the journey, highlighting Jornet's minimalist approach and profound connection with nature, framing his feats not just as record-setting but as an artistic expression of movement through wilderness. His motivation was driven by a desire to explore new landscapes and test the limits of human physiology.</p>

It highlights the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and Albert Einstein's divorce settlement, where he promised his future Nobel prize money to his wife. The piece also delves into controversies, such as Einstein never winning for his theory of relativity and the historical overlooking of female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin. Additionally, it notes that prizes have been awarded for science later debunked, such as the lobotomy, and have never been revoked.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport has experienced significant disruptions for the second consecutive day, with flight operations repeatedly suspended due to unconfirmed drone sightings in the vicinity. The closures led to numerous flight cancellations and diversions, affecting thousands of passengers and forcing the airport to provide temporary accommodation. The incidents, which included a drone spotted over a nearby German military facility, have prompted Germany's Interior Minister to call the situation a "wake-up call" for enhancing drone defense. The airport is gradually resuming services, but delays are expected to continue throughout the day.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is seeing a notable surge in support, particularly among ethnic Germans who resettled from the former Soviet Union. Recent studies show that this demographic is significantly more likely to vote for the AfD compared to the general population or other migrant groups. This trend was evident in recent local elections where the AfD dominated integration councils in areas with large Russia German populations. The party's appeal is attributed to its anti-immigration platform, Russia-friendly foreign policy stance, and targeted outreach to this specific community.</p>

Experts offer various perspectives, with some attributing aggression to social media toxicity and political polarization, while others argue that data shows major disturbances are rare exceptions.

          <p>A new defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which a Saudi official confirmed would "encompass all military means," is raising questions about Riyadh potentially falling under Pakistan's nuclear umbrella. This development presents a strategic dilemma for China, a close ally to both nations that has historically assisted with Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear program. Analysts suggest Beijing would be hesitant to see this partnership extend to nuclear capabilities, as it could provoke the United States and undermine China's position against nuclear proliferation. The move is seen as a response to regional instability and perceived U.S. reluctance to protect its allies.</p>

This move is framed as a significant pivot, cornering Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reflecting Trump's desire to end the conflict and secure a major foreign policy win.

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Commemorative $1 Coin Featuring President's Image for Nation's 250th Anniversary</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering minting a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump's image to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach shared a draft design showing Trump's face and, on the reverse, a depiction of him after his 2014 near-assassination attempt with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." The move is potentially enabled by a 2020 law allowing for semiquincentennial coin designs. However, the proposal faces legal hurdles, including a long-standing U.S. law that prohibits living persons from appearing on currency, though congressional exceptions have been made in the past.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a response to President Trump's Gaza peace proposal, agreeing to key parts such as the release of all hostages but indicating other elements require further negotiation. The U.S. is viewing the response as positive, and Israel has announced it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. Following the statement, President Trump urged Israel to immediately stop its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, declaring his belief that Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." The move signals a potential breakthrough in the nearly two-year-long conflict, with discussions on the remaining details expected to begin soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a surge in novel drug development that is attracting international recognition. A key example is a cancer drug from a Guangzhou-based biotech firm, which a late-stage trial showed was more effective at delaying lung cancer progression than Merck's blockbuster drug, Keytruda. This success is highlighted as evidence of China's growing prowess in creating innovative medicines, moving beyond its past role as a manufacturer of generic drugs. While significant progress has been made, experts remain watchful to see if the sector can consistently produce true breakthrough innovations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Morocco is experiencing a wave of youth-led protests, coordinated by a group called "Gen Z 212," demanding the government prioritize essential services like healthcare and education over massive spending on the 2030 World Cup. Demonstrators argue that the reported $5 billion investment in football infrastructure is misplaced when public hospitals and schools are underfunded. The movement, which has spread across multiple cities, was galvanized by the deaths of eight women in a maternity ward, highlighting deficiencies in the healthcare system. Despite a police crackdown and numerous arrests, the leaderless protesters have vowed to continue until they see concrete change.</p>

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs has been sentenced to 50 months in prison following his conviction on two federal prostitution-related charges. Before the sentence was delivered, Combs apologized to his victims and family, stating his actions were "disgusting, shameful, and sick." Prosecutors had sought an 11-year term, citing his history of domestic violence, while his defense argued for 14 months, claiming he was a changed man. The judge ultimately imposed a significant sentence as a deterrent, emphasizing the need for accountability for violence against women and stating that Combs had subjugated his victims through his power and wealth.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a "showy" arrest and perp walk for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted on charges of lying to Congress. According to sources, FBI leadership discussed using "large, beefy" agents for the arrest, but a supervisory special agent who refused to participate in the plan was suspended for insubordination. The unusual move comes after Comey was issued a standard summons to appear for his arraignment. This development marks a significant escalation in the feud between President Trump and Comey, whom the president has publicly pressured the attorney general to investigate.</p>
