          <p>The Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether a California law allowing transgender athletes to participate on female sports teams violates federal civil rights law. This action follows President Trump's threat to revoke federal funding from California if it doesn't comply with his executive order banning transgender athletes from women's sports. The investigation aims to determine if California and its related organizations are engaging in discrimination based on sex, and the Justice Department has also filed a statement of interest in a lawsuit arguing against trans athletes competing with cisgender female athletes under federal law. The article states that the Justice Department views this as a national effort to protect fair athletic opportunities for women and girls.</p>

          <p>President Trump has rejected the notion that his tariff threats and subsequent delays are a sign of backing down, dismissing the term "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out). When questioned about the term, Trump argued that his tariff moves have been instrumental in gaining ground in trade negotiations with other countries. He cited the European Union's willingness to meet after he threatened tariffs, suggesting that his actions are a form of negotiation.

          <p>An international team of astronomers has discovered a strange object in the Milky Way galaxy emitting both X-rays and radio waves in a repeating cycle. The object, located 15,000 light-years away, emits these signals every 44 minutes, leading scientists to describe it as unlike any known Galactic object. It could be a highly magnetized dead star or something entirely new, according to Ziteng Andy Wang of Curtin University, lead author of the study. NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory first spotted the X-ray emissions while observing a supernova remnant, marking the first time X-rays have been seen from a long-period radio transient.</p>

Local authorities have requested support from the Swiss army's disaster relief unit, and members of the Swiss government are en route to assess the situation.
