          <p>A driver intentionally drove into a crowd attending a Filipino street festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, resulting in at least nine fatalities. Vancouver police have taken a 30-year-old man into custody, ruling out terrorism as a motive but providing no further details regarding the incident. The event, the Lapu Lapu Day Festival, celebrates a national hero in the Philippines and was near East 43rd Avenue and Fraser Street when the tragic incident occurred.

          <p>Many young adults are returning to their family businesses due to a cooling labor market and a desire to build value for their families, but it's not always easy. Returning children face challenges such as establishing trust, overcoming credibility gaps, and navigating family dynamics, while parents may have concerns about expenses and succession plans. However, bringing expertise learned in the corporate world and providing peace of mind to parents can make the transition successful, despite potential sacrifices in salary and prestige. Ultimately, the real value lies in gaining more control over one's life.</p>

          <p>Unexpected tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have created uncertainty in Taiwan regarding the dependability of American support. The Lai administration was surprised by the 32% levy, which significantly impacts key sectors like hi-tech manufacturing. Taiwan's exclusion from initial trade negotiations, despite investments like TSMC's Arizona chip plants and increased defense spending, has further fueled concerns. This situation raises questions about whether Taiwan's strategic importance is primarily judged by its economic and military contributions.</p>

          <p>Despite challenges from the Trump administration's policies and supply chain issues, the U.S. onshore wind energy industry is experiencing a "repowering" boom, creating opportunities for companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. As many wind turbines reach the end of their lifecycles, operators are choosing to upgrade or replace them with more efficient models, increasing electricity output. This repowering activity offers economic benefits, such as avoiding property acquisition costs, and contributes to the growth of turbine recycling industries. The onshore wind industry is working to meet the nation's growing electricity demand amidst rising capital costs and political opposition.</p>

          <p>Robert Walters, a senior vice president at AT&T, advises focusing on raising the overall performance of a team rather than striving to be the absolute best individual performer. He found that nurturing relationships and helping others succeed leads to better collective outcomes. Experts like Simon Sinek support this approach, advocating for an "infinite mindset" focused on continuous improvement. Walters emphasizes "stacking days" with small, consistent progress, leading to significant career growth over time.</p>

This statement contradicts Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, who has ruled out such a coalition.

          <p>Marks & Spencer has paused online orders after a cyber attack, causing a "bruise" to its reputation, according to analysts. The retailer has been working to restore operations since Friday, with customers reporting issues with contactless payments and gift cards. Analysts warn that M&S could lose sales if the problem is not resolved quickly, as shoppers may turn to rival brands. While the incident is a setback, analysts believe that M&S's quick response and open communication can limit long-term damage.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days have brought significant changes, but his focus on tariffs is causing concern among Americans. While his base remains loyal, others believe he is not prioritizing lowering prices, leading to declining approval ratings on the economy and inflation. The poll also reveals differing views on immigration, with most Americans approving of his deportation program but disapproving of potential errors in its implementation. Overall, the poll suggests a divided nation with varying perceptions of Trump's performance and priorities.</p>

Despite claims of being "ripped off," the US remains the biggest beneficiary of global trade, and that when trade in goods, trade in services and the local sales of domestic companies’ branches in each other’s countries are taken into full account, China and the US have benefited more or less equally from their two-way trade.</p>
