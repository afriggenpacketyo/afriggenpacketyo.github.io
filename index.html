          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to join a video call with European allies, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, on Sunday. The call aims to coordinate their stance ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House next week. This diplomatic effort follows a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that did not result in a ceasefire agreement. Starmer commended Trump's efforts but emphasized that any path to peace cannot be decided without President Zelensky's direct involvement and agreement.</p>

While the majority of meteorological models predict the storm will remain offshore, the U.S. East Coast is preparing for large waves and life-threatening rip currents expected next week.

          <p>Bryan Patrick Miller, a local figure known for his "Zombie Hunter" persona, has been convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of two women in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The cold cases of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas were solved after 21 years using DNA and genetic genealogy. Miller's defense team admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming severe childhood abuse led to dissociative amnesia. The judge acknowledged the abuse but ultimately found him guilty of the brutal crimes.</p>

          <p>A scheduled visit by U.S. trade representatives to New Delhi later this month has reportedly been called off, delaying crucial negotiations. This postponement occurs amid escalating trade tensions, particularly after President Donald Trump imposed a cumulative 50% tariff on Indian exports. The additional duties were framed as a penalty for India's procurement of Russian crude oil. While both countries remain in contact, a new date for the talks has not been finalized, leaving Indian exporters concerned about the significant financial impact.</p>

          <p>The states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced plans to deploy hundreds of their National Guard members to Washington D.C. This action supports the Trump administration's federal crackdown in the capital, which was initiated through an executive order federalizing the local police force. The stated purpose of the deployment is to bolster public safety and protect federal assets. The move has been met with protests from demonstrators who characterize it as a military occupation and an overreach of federal power.</p>

This lack of transparency adds to the uncertainty surrounding the 37-year-old veteran's availability for the upcoming season opener. Stafford has been dealing with an aggravated disc that has kept him out of team practices. In his absence during the preseason game against the Chargers, backup quarterback Stetson Bennett delivered a strong performance, completing 28 of 40 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes a unique "scissor wing" design, a dream previously explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft features a single, centrally mounted wing that can rotate up to 90 degrees. This allows it to function like a conventional plane at low speeds for efficient takeoff and pivot to mitigate shock waves at transonic speeds. At hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel to the fuselage, transforming the entire aircraft into a highly efficient "waverider" configuration.</p>

The reasons include a lifetime of conforming to being "good" which can create a void, the burnout from perfectionism, and having poor boundaries developed from a childhood of shouldering parental responsibilities. Other significant catalysts are being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage, and experiencing a recent major loss, which can trigger a re-evaluation of life priorities and relationship dynamics.</p>

This "false autumn" could have negative consequences for wildlife, as an early ripening of fruits like blackberries may disrupt the food supply for birds and other animals preparing for winter. The unusual conditions highlight the chaotic impact of climate change on natural cycles.</p>

          <p>A homeless encampment in Washington D.C. was dismantled by city officials just days after President Donald Trump posted photos of it on social media and demanded immediate removal. One of the residents, Bill Theodie, was identified in a photo shared by the president and expressed shock at being used as a political tool. The clearance was part of a broader crackdown on homelessness announced by the administration, which involves removing encampments from public parks. While the White House has offered shelter placement, critics and residents argue the system is flawed and shelter capacity is limited.</p>

          <p>The body of British property tycoon Harry Roy Veevers has been held in a Kenyan mortuary for 11 years due to a bitter family dispute following his death in 2013. An inquest concluded this week but failed to determine a cause of death due to the body's decomposition after being exhumed. The case has pitted Veevers' two sons against his second wife and their two daughters, involving accusations of poisoning to inherit his estate. A magistrate has ordered the body released for reburial, but the deeply divided family is now left to contest his final resting place.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in March 2021, just as they were returning to school from a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters captured their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions ranging from whether they would still need face masks to if they had a girlfriend yet. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their disrupted secondary school education and a reminder of their long-held ambitions as they prepared to receive their exam results.</p>

          <p>During his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump regarding children affected by the war in Ukraine. The letter vaguely implores the Russian president to restore the "melodic laughter" of children whose innocence is impacted by conflict, calling on him to implement this vision "with a stroke of the pen." While officials stated the letter raised concerns about child abductions, the text does not explicitly mention the thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly transferred to Russia, a situation that has led to war crime indictments against Putin.</p>

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is grappling with its dark past as a secretive religious sect known as Colonia Dignidad. Under founder Paul Schäfer, it was a site of child abuse and forced labor, and later served as a torture center for the Pinochet dictatorship. Today, some residents have transformed it into a tourist destination, but the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the victims. This plan has divided the community, with some supporting the memorial while others fear it will displace them once again.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing diners to authentic regional cuisines far beyond stereotypical Westernized dishes like chow mein.

These establishments often feature immersive cultural experiences and aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese cuisine. This culinary expansion is being viewed by some as a potent form of cultural diplomacy for China.</p>
