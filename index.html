          <p>England's Red Roses began their Women's Rugby World Cup campaign with a resounding 69-7 victory over the United States, played before a record-breaking crowd of 42,723. Star player Ellie Kildunne delivered an exceptional performance, scoring two tries and setting up two more, earning player-of-the-match honors. While the team showcased smooth execution, head coach John Mitchell identified areas needing refinement, including midfield passes and defensive intensity, stressing that the team has much growth ahead. This commitment to continuous improvement, even after a dominant win, suggests a formidable challenge for their upcoming opponents.</p>

This case follows Jake Haro's prior conviction for child cruelty in 2023 and the recent removal of another 2-year-old child from their home.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and subsequently returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee. Hours after his release, his attorneys received notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, an East African nation that recently agreed to accept deportees who are not its citizens. This development underscores the Trump administration's strategy of deporting undocumented immigrants to "third countries," even though a 2019 ruling prevented Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador due to gang persecution fears. He plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family, under a judge's order requiring 72 hours' notice for any new deportation proceedings.</p>

These artists, often established but not superstar-level, are targeted by unknown parties who use AI to mimic their vocal styles and instrumentation, sometimes successfully deceiving fans. This trend highlights a significant challenge in the music industry, where AI facilitates identity exploitation for potential, albeit small, royalty gains. The article emphasizes the urgent need for better legal protections for artists and more proactive measures from streaming services to combat this "dystopian" form of digital impersonation.</p>

          <p>West Ham manager Graham Potter is facing significant pressure after the team's disastrous start to the Premier League season, including a 3-0 defeat to Sunderland and a 5-1 home thrashing by Chelsea. This poor run has seen the Hammers concede eight goals in their first two games, a club record, leading to widespread fan discontent. Potter's overall record since taking charge in January is concerning, with only five wins in 21 matches and a historically low points tally in his first ten home games. Despite recent signings, defensive frailties, particularly from set-pieces, remain evident, prompting serious worries about the team's trajectory and potential relegation struggle.</p>

This surge also boosted shares of companies focused on accumulating Ether and other crypto-related firms.

She denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by former President Trump or Prince Andrew and claimed the famous photo of Andrew with Virginia Giuffre was "fake."

          <p>Post-tropical cyclone Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, continues to move away from the northeastern U.S. coast but still poses a significant danger to swimmers. Despite weakening to a post-tropical system, Erin remains a "large and powerful hurricane-force low-pressure system," generating increased waves and life-threatening rip currents along much of the Eastern Seaboard. Coastal areas from the mid-Atlantic to New England, including North Carolina's Outer Banks and parts of New York City, have experienced flooding and dangerous conditions, leading to beach closures and numerous rescues. Forecasters predict above-normal hurricane activity for the Atlantic season.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. government has acquired a 10% stake in Intel, making it one of the chipmaker's largest shareholders. This deal, valued at approximately $8.9 billion, converts previously awarded grants from the CHIPS and Science Act and Secure Enclave program into common stock. The move follows Trump's earlier criticism of Intel's CEO regarding ties to China and his administration's broader strategy to boost domestic chip production and maintain a technological lead over China. While the shares are non-voting, this unprecedented intervention blurs the lines between public and private sectors, aiming to advance national security and economic objectives.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong can establish a crucial role in climate resilience within the economically dynamic Greater Bay Area (GBA), which faces increasing risks from extreme weather. With a population of over 86 million and a GDP of $2 trillion, the GBA's integration means climate disruptions in one area can cascade throughout the region. The article proposes developing a cross-border early warning platform and implementing common infrastructure standards, similar to the EU's Copernicus service, to safeguard trade and investment. Investing in resilient infrastructure is presented as an economic strategy, with every dollar spent potentially yielding four dollars in benefits.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an investigation into imported furniture, signaling forthcoming tariffs within 50 days, aiming to revitalize the U.S. furniture industry in states like North Carolina and Michigan. Following his announcement, shares of major furniture and home goods companies like Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma tumbled, while U.S.-based manufacturer La-Z-Boy saw its shares rise. These new tariffs, which might be layered on existing country-specific rates, come as the furniture industry faces challenges from decreased demand due to a slower housing market and persistent inflation. Trump has previously imposed tariffs on other sectors and continues to advocate for trade protectionism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), reportedly due to an intelligence assessment on U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities that angered President Trump. The DIA's preliminary assessment suggested the strikes set back Iran's program by only months, contradicting Trump's claims of complete obliteration. This firing is the latest in a series of upheavals within military and intelligence agencies, with critics accusing the administration of politicizing intelligence and prioritizing loyalty over objective analysis.

          <p>This opinion article by Francine Prose critically examines President Trump's reported critique of the Smithsonian Institution for focusing on "how bad slavery was," and his administration's alleged attempts to micro-manage museum exhibits. The author argues that Trump's desire for "unifying and constructive descriptions" aims to whitewash history, presenting an unblemished American past inconsistent with historical truths. Prose contends that erasing difficult historical realities, like slavery and racial discrimination, is an insult to affected communities and prevents a proper understanding of the present. The article warns against an authoritarian approach that seeks to control historical narratives and undermine the importance of truth.</p>

The article notes Bolton's long-standing reputation for meticulousness and his own past criticism of government over-classification.

          <p>California and Texas are at the forefront of an intense national redistricting battle, with lawmakers redrawing congressional maps to gain political advantage before next year's midterm elections. Texas Republicans initially created five new seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to retaliate by proposing maps to boost their own representation by five seats. This "political arms race" highlights the practice of gerrymandering, where electoral boundaries are manipulated to favor a party, which is legal unless racially motivated. The article explains how this mid-decade redistricting aims to influence the balance of power in the House, with other states also considering similar measures.</p>

However, Powell also warned that long-term "neutral" rates might be higher than in the past, meaning borrowing costs like mortgages may not return to pre-pandemic lows. This complex economic balancing act is further complicated by President Trump's trade war and tariffs, which Powell acknowledged are beginning to push up inflation. The article suggests that while the Fed aims for a "soft landing," executive policies are creating instability in the labor market and economy, limiting the central bank's ability to mitigate structural changes.

Satellite imagery shows Vietnam has extended its work to eight new features since early this year, meaning all 21 Vietnamese-occupied sites now include artificial land. This expansion, including new infrastructure and munitions storage, is expected to bring Vietnam's created land to match and likely exceed China's 70% by March 2025.
