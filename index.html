          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned after a lengthy legal battle. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, had been the subject of a dispute after a South Korean temple claimed it was plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, leading to the statue's return, which is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony. This event concludes a contentious issue that strained relations between Japan and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it will release US-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to facilitate a ceasefire agreement and humanitarian aid entry into Gaza. This decision precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East, with Hamas aiming to reach a final agreement to end the war. The Israeli PM's office stated that preparations were being made to intensify fighting, attributing the release to military pressure on Hamas. Trump confirmed Alexander's release, calling it a monumental step in good faith, while negotiations continue amidst reports of growing frustration within the Trump administration regarding Netanyahu's position.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has ended four days of intense hostilities, but experts believe it will not easily lead to lasting peace due to long-term distrust. While the US played a decisive role in mediating the ceasefire, analysts from both countries emphasize that addressing underlying issues like terrorism and water security is crucial for enduring stability. Both sides reportedly used the military escalation to test each other's resolve, realizing the devastating potential of a full-scale war. Saudi Arabia and Iran also emerged as key mediators due to their strong economic and diplomatic ties with both India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and grown-up children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad, while immigrants will need to wait ten years to become British citizens. The government's actions are viewed as an attempt to seize the narrative from Reform UK, which gained ground in recent local elections. However, the Conservative party has criticized the plans as insufficient, arguing they lack a cap on numbers and questioning how success will be measured.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traders have reportedly rebranded over $1 billion of Venezuelan oil shipments to China as Brazilian crude to bypass US sanctions and reduce logistics costs. Tankers are spoofing their location signals to appear as if they are departing from Brazilian ports when they are actually sailing from Venezuela, avoiding stop-overs in Malaysia. This practice allows for direct shipments from Venezuela to China, shortening the voyage by approximately four days. China has imported significant amounts of mixed bitumen from Brazil, despite Brazil rarely exporting this product, raising suspicions of rebranded Venezuelan oil.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains highly popular in the Philippines, as evidenced by the outpouring of support following his arrest and extradition to The Hague.

His arrest has sharply divided the Philippines, with some believing he is a victim of political persecution by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte, has seen her approval rating rise, positioning her as a potential future presidential candidate.</p>

The provision aims to make large groups providing abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid funds, but concerns have been raised about the definition of these groups.

          <h2>Former Malaysian PM Warns US Tariffs Will Hurt Americans Most</h2>

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad predicts that President Trump's tariffs will harm Americans more than targeted countries by increasing the US cost of living. He argues that American products cannot compete with cheaper alternatives, leading to economic suffering for the US. Mahathir suggests that items like iPhones produced in China and India will become more expensive due to the tariffs. He believes ASEAN can withstand the impact through intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States, and advocates for peaceful resolution rather than retaliation.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, based in San Fernando, CA, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators discovered a strain of listeria on its equipment linked to a 2024 outbreak. The recalled products, sold under multiple brands, were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The recall was initiated after a routine inspection revealed the listeria strain, which matched the strain causing illnesses in the previous outbreak. The company stated it is taking precautionary measures to ensure consumer safety, though no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, launched a Hong Kong IPO aiming to raise up to US$5.3 billion, marking the city's largest stock sale since 2021. The deal, priced at a tight discount to its domestic share price, attracted cornerstone investors committing about US$2.6 billion. Despite market uncertainty amid US-China trade tensions, CATL's offering reflects strong liquidity and supportive policies in Hong Kong. The deal is expected to be the largest new share sale since Kuaishou Technology's IPO in January 2021, assuming all upsize options are exercised.</p>

          <p>The offshore yuan gained value against the US dollar amid reports of progress in China-US trade talks, though details of the outcome remain undisclosed. Optimism has risen in the market, fueled by expectations of constructive results from the negotiations between the world's two largest economies. The two-day talks, attended by high-level officials, marked the first formal trade negotiations since Trump increased tariff rates on Chinese goods. The White House has imposed new tariffs of 145 per cent on China this year, while Beijing has imposed 125 per cent levies on US goods in return.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order requiring the U.S. to pay the same price as other nations for some drugs, aiming to lower medication costs. The order, revisiting a previously blocked initiative, directs HHS to tie Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctors' offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The proposal is likely to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that it would stifle innovation. However, Trump insists that it will save the government trillions of dollars and treat American citizens fairly.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Taiwan have faced criticism for removing the 'Han' category from demographic groups listed on the official information page, a move seen as distancing the island from mainland China. The revised web page categorizes Han Chinese – the majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait – as 'other population'. The change comes as Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) intensifies its efforts to promote the island’s indigenous identity. The Executive Yuan did not publicly announce the change to the ethnic composition section, which was made on March 24.</p>
