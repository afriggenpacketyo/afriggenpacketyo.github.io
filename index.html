          <h2>Senate Advances Contentious Trump-Backed Domestic Policy Bill Amid Partisan and Internal GOP Strife</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 16:01:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun voting on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, a massive piece of legislation combining significant tax cuts with major spending reductions. The bill aims to extend many Trump-era tax breaks and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime, but also proposes deep cuts to welfare programs that could affect millions of low-income Americans' health insurance. The process is fraught with political tension, as Democrats utilize procedural tactics to delay the vote and highlight their strong opposition. Meanwhile, fractures within the Republican party are evident, with key senators expressing dissent over the bill's impact on the national debt and Medicaid, making its final passage uncertain as leadership pushes towards a tight deadline.</p>

          <p>When a debt collector denies a dispute claim, consumers still have several strategic options to resolve the issue and protect their financial well-being. This article outlines five potential paths, including negotiating a settlement to have a portion of the debt forgiven or working with a credit counseling agency on a debt management plan to lower interest rates. Other alternatives involve using a debt consolidation loan to combine outstanding balances into a single, more manageable payment, or inquiring about hardship programs that may be offered by creditors. For those facing an overwhelming financial crisis, filing for bankruptcy is presented as a final, though significant, option for achieving a fresh start. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. solar and wind industries are confronting a potential tax hike of up to $7 billion under the latest version of a Republican-led domestic spending bill. The proposed legislation introduces a new tax on renewable energy projects that use components from foreign entities of concern, primarily targeting China, and also phases out key tax credits for the industry after 2027. Trade groups warn these measures could jeopardize hundreds of thousands of construction jobs and threaten the development of 300 gigawatts of clean energy projects. The unexpected tax has been described as punitive by industry leaders and could potentially lead to higher electricity prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a remarkable 65% price increase over the past 18 months, gold investors are now considering the potential for price movements in July. This article analyzes key economic factors, suggesting that the precious metal's price is likely to remain relatively stable. With inflation holding steady and the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates until at least September, two major drivers of gold price volatility are currently muted. While unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard that could shift market sentiment, the current economic climate points towards a period of consolidation for gold rather than another dramatic spike or decline in its value.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially ending the U.S. sanctions program on Syria, a move intended to support the country's new transitional government. The order lifts broad economic sanctions but maintains targeted penalties against former president Bashar al-Assad and his associates, as well as those linked to human rights abuses and terrorism. This action follows months of lobbying by the new Syrian government for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and stabilize the economy after years of civil war. U.S. allies in the region, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, have supported normalizing relations, viewing it as an opportunity to foster stability and counter Iranian influence.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has developed a comprehensive national citizenship database. This system integrates records from immigration agencies and the Social Security Administration, creating a centralized, searchable repository accessible to state and local election officials for verifying voter citizenship. The creation of this database has raised significant alarm among privacy and immigration advocates, who argue it was built without public transparency and could be used to intimidate communities. Critics also point to legal challenges and concerns that consolidating such vast amounts of personal information sidesteps established privacy protections and poses a major surveillance risk.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, claiming its sanctuary policies unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that such policies undermine law enforcement at all levels and were a driving factor in recent civil unrest. This legal action is part of a broader administration effort to compel local jurisdictions to cooperate with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lawsuit represents a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the federal government and cities that have adopted policies to limit their involvement in the enforcement of federal immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring users in California to verify their identity using a mandatory facial recognition feature called Face Check. This new measure is being tested to combat the rise of fraud, fake profiles, and romance scams on the platform. The system, powered by FaceTec technology, prompts new users to record a short video selfie, which is then used to confirm they are a real person and that their appearance matches their profile photos. While the company states the data is deleted 30 days after an account is closed, the move highlights a growing trend of tech platforms using biometric data to enhance security and user trust, though it also raises privacy considerations.</p>

The jury of eight men and four women is tasked with reaching a unanimous verdict on multiple charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, which could result in a life sentence for the music mogul.

          <p>The Israeli military has stated it is investigating numerous reports of Palestinian civilians being harmed, with over 400 reported killed, while trying to access aid in Gaza. The incidents occurred near distribution centers run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a system established to bypass the UN. While the IDF has previously claimed it only fired "warning shots," Israeli media reported the military acknowledged that inaccurate fire led to some casualties. The UN has condemned the GHF system as "inherently unsafe," and the reports of deaths have sparked widespread international condemnation, adding another layer of tragedy to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock surged 10% to an all-time high after the company announced it will offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX to its European users. This move marks the company's first venture into making private equity accessible to retail investors through blockchain technology, a step facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. The tokenized assets are part of a broader expansion of Robinhood's crypto services in Europe, which now include over 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs. While regulatory hurdles prevent a similar offering in the U.S. for now, the initiative represents a significant step towards democratizing access to pre-IPO investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed that it will lose access to a key satellite data program used for weather forecasting by July 31, right as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season. The data comes from the Department of Defense's long-running Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), which is being decommissioned due to cybersecurity risks and modernization requirements. While NOAA officials state that their remaining data sources are robust and capable of ensuring high-quality forecasts, the loss of this historical data stream raises concerns.

Prosecutors described the June 21 incident as an "absolutely outrageous" crime, stating the driver forced hundreds of pedestrians to run in terror to avoid being hit. Court filings include photographs showing the vehicle kicking up dirt near the U.S. Capitol and causing an estimated $10,000 in damages to the landmark.

          <p>The slang term "crashing out" has gained prominence, particularly among Gen Z, to describe a wide range of unfiltered emotional outbursts, from angry tantrums to public sobbing. This article explores the phenomenon, linking its popularity to celebrity behavior and viral TikTok trends where users document their own meltdowns. The catchall phrase is used to explain reactions to stress, anxiety, or mental health struggles, reflecting a generation that is both highly stressed and increasingly public with its vulnerability. While some see it as a form of catharsis, mental health professionals express concern that the trend normalizes emotional dysregulation and may discourage the development of healthier coping mechanisms.</p>
