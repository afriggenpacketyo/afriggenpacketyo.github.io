          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 103-91 in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, securing their first NBA championship since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, capping off his MVP season. The Pacers struggled after losing Tyrese Haliburton to a leg injury early in the game, and despite Bennedict Mathurin's 24 points, they couldn't overcome the Thunder's strong second-half performance. This victory marks a significant milestone for the Thunder, who finished the season with 84 wins, tying the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for the third-most in any season.</p>

          <p>Oil prices are experiencing increased volatility as the U.S. joins the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. Experts warn of possible triple-digit oil prices, especially if Iran takes countermeasures such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical route for global oil trade. While the market reaction has been relatively mild so far, the direct involvement of the U.S. has introduced a new level of uncertainty. A prolonged closure or harassment of passage through the Strait could lead to a significant spike in oil prices, potentially reaching levels not seen since 2022 (not investment advice).</p>

However, Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native previously deported to El Salvador despite a court order, may be taken into ICE custody instead. The defense argues the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's case. Another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence is increasingly used, researchers are uncovering more cases of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The emergence of these issues is compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Researchers advocate for practices like red teaming, where AI systems are tested to uncover potential harm. They also suggest adopting standardized "AI flaw" reports and disseminating information on these flaws to improve the understanding of risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <p>Despite a Tennessee judge's order for his release, Kilmar Abrego Garcia is likely to be placed in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody due to an immigration detainer. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported, faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. Judge Barbara Holmes acknowledged that if released, Abrego Garcia would likely be detained by ICE pending further removal proceedings. A hearing is scheduled to determine the conditions of release, but the U.S. Attorney has filed a motion for a stay of the judge's order.</p>

          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, identifies five phrases that parents should avoid to foster cooperation with their children. These include phrases that shut down communication, create defiance, dismiss emotions, assume intentional difficulty, and shame the child. Instead, Raouda suggests using language that respects the child's autonomy, acknowledges their feelings, invites problem-solving, and encourages self-reflection. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, emphasizing respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>
