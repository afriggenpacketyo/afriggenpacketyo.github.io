          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:55:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's substantial offshore oil reserves. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated a challenge from Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The integration of the two companies is expected to result in some headcount reductions as part of ongoing efficiency efforts.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have dropped their criminal investigation into the Irish rap group Kneecap following their controversial performance at the Glastonbury festival. The inquiry was initiated over on-stage comments, including a statement about starting a riot in reference to a band member's upcoming court case. However, police and the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. Kneecap described the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation," while a separate police inquiry into the band Bob Vylan's performance at the same festival is still ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has publicly condemned a federal judge's order to release a transgender migrant from a male detention facility. The DHS accused the judge of promoting "gender ideology fanaticism" and ignoring the rule of law, referencing a Trump executive order to detain individuals based on biological sex. The migrant, who is seeking asylum after allegedly experiencing abduction and sexual assault in Mexico, was released after the judge found her detention violated procedural fairness. Her attorneys argued that ICE's failure to provide information on her location after her arrest was a due process violation.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal heard testimony that a transgender doctor, Dr. Beth Upton, was visibly shaken and sobbing while reporting a confrontation with a nurse over the use of a female changing room. A senior colleague, Dr. Elspeth Pitt, described Dr. Upton as pale and distressed following the incident on Christmas Eve 2023 at a hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. The nurse involved, Sandie Peggie, was suspended but later cleared of gross misconduct by the health board. The tribunal is examining the circumstances of the disagreement, which Dr. Upton described as an "aggressive" and "unkind" encounter.</p>

          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that fears of high inflation are subsiding, with expectations for future price increases falling to their lowest levels since before President Trump's tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% in July from 5.0% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This data suggests consumers believe the tariff-related price hikes will be temporary and that conditions will improve into 2026. Overall consumer sentiment also ticked slightly higher for the month, aligning with economists' forecasts and reflecting a more optimistic economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, led a decade-long research project suggesting the princes actually survived. The project approached the mystery as a cold case, uncovering documents that she argues serve as proof of life for the boys. This controversial thesis shifts the historical narrative, placing the blame for the story of their murder on the subsequent Tudor dynasty.</p>

As a result, these seasonal favorites are becoming luxury items, with the average price of asparagus up 4% from last year.

          <p>A provision in the newly enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act will require most visitors to the United States to pay a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee applies to nonimmigrant visa applicants and is in addition to existing visa application costs. The legislation includes a mechanism for travelers to be reimbursed if they comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying. However, significant questions remain about the implementation process, including how the fee will be collected and how the complex reimbursement system will function, creating uncertainty for future travelers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recently enacted "big beautiful bill" includes a "no tax on tips" provision, which creates a new federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped workers. The tax break, available from 2025 through 2028, does not eliminate payroll or state taxes on tips and phases out for higher earners. Significant questions remain about its implementation, as the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify. Tax professionals note that there is uncertainty, particularly for workers who may not receive standard tax forms like a W-2 or 1099.</p>

However, the traditional liturgical acts honoring the Divine Savior of the World, the patron of El Salvador, will still take place.

The piece suggests that the Epstein scandal, with its real-world horrors mirroring conspiracist fantasies, has become too unwieldy for Trump to control.

          <p>An in-depth investigation into the catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, which killed 27 people, points to a critical failure to implement a modern flood warning system. The article reveals that Kerr County's application for state funding for a new gauge and siren system along the Guadalupe River was denied in 2018. Without the funds, the old, inactive system was never replaced, leaving the camp without an early warning of the life-threatening surge of water.
