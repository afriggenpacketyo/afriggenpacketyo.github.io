          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Adviser to Donald Trump and a vocal critic, has been criminally indicted on federal charges related to the handling of classified information. A grand jury in Maryland found sufficient evidence to proceed with charges, which could lead to a decade in prison per count if he is found guilty. Bolton maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically motivated and part of an effort by Trump to weaponize the Justice Department against his perceived enemies. His lawyer states the charges stem from unclassified diary entries shared only with immediate family and known to the FBI since 2021.</p>

          <p>Country music star Keith Urban was forced to cancel his South Carolina concert last minute due to laryngitis, as advised by his laryngologist. The 57-year-old singer expressed deep apologies to his fans for the inconvenience, hoping to return to the stage soon. This cancellation follows recent news of his divorce filing from Nicole Kidman after nearly two decades of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. Kidman had previously spoken about coping with hardship by drawing on past experiences, emphasizing resilience through difficult times.</p>

          <p>Alaska is undertaking one of its largest airlifts in history to evacuate hundreds of residents from coastal villages ravaged by record flooding and high winds from Typhoon Halong's remnants. The disaster, which washed away homes and left two people missing, has forced approximately 1,500 individuals into makeshift shelters. Emergency management officials describe it as one of the state's worst disasters, comparing it to Hurricane Katrina but without roads, with winter rapidly approaching. The crisis also highlights criticisms of Trump administration cuts to grants for disaster preparedness in vulnerable, often Indigenous, communities.</p>

          <p>China's extensive property market is projected to continue its decline at least through 2026, according to S&P Global Ratings. Director Edward Chan stated that nationwide primary property sales are expected to fall by 8% in 2025 and 6-7% in 2026 due to persistent soft demand. This ongoing downturn will intensify pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are already struggling to deliver homes while managing significant debt obligations. One developer, Cifi, recently announced a plan to restructure its debt, issuing new bonds and paying cash to creditors to reduce offshore obligations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has controversially authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, an unusual public admission for such sensitive actions. This move comes amidst heightened U.S. military activity in the Caribbean, including airstrikes on suspected drug-carrying vessels, which have resulted in fatalities. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has publicly appealed for peace with the U.S., while expressing alarm over the escalating military deployments and the potential for CIA-orchestrated coups. The authorization has sparked fears in Caracas of a possible attack, with some U.N. experts labeling previous U.S. strikes as extrajudicial executions.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in nuclear fusion research, with private and state-backed enterprises aiming to build a commercial fusion reactor by 2035 or sooner. The ENN Group campus in Langfang, Hebei province, hosts experimental facilities like the EXL-50U tokamak, where engineers are working to achieve plasma temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius. The goal is to harness the energy released from fusing light atoms into heavier ones, which could provide vast amounts of clean electricity. This ambitious pursuit positions China at the forefront of the global race to develop sustainable fusion power.</p>

The Safety Advisory Group, citing current intelligence and past incidents of violence and hate crime involving Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, deemed the match high-risk. Both the Prime Minister and opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the ban, emphasizing the need to combat antisemitism and ensure all fans can safely enjoy games. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar called the decision 'shameful,' urging its reversal amidst wider protests over the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced initiatives to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), urging U.S. employers to offer new fertility benefit options. President Trump also secured a deal with EMD Serono to lower the cost of a key fertility drug, which will be available on TrumpRx.gov. These moves aim to increase the availability of IVF, a procedure often not covered by insurance and costing tens of thousands of dollars. The initiative follows Trump's campaign promise to address IVF costs, particularly after a controversial Alabama Supreme Court ruling impacted embryo disposition. The administration frames this as 'pro-life' and essential for national well-being.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced upcoming meetings with senior Chinese leaders, signaling a broader re-engagement with Beijing. However, he remained non-committal on whether Ottawa would lift tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Carney emphasized that decisions regarding the auto sector would consider dynamics with the United States and ongoing negotiations, acknowledging the complex geopolitical tightrope. China's ambassador had previously linked the removal of canola duties to Ottawa lifting EV tariffs, creating a domestic divide with western provinces favoring a deal and Ontario opposing it due to its auto sector interests.
