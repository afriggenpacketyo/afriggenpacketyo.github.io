          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September if Israel does not agree to a ceasefire and take steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people. The decision has drawn a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism, and has received mixed reactions from UK political parties, highlighting deep divisions on the issue.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced its second-quarter net profit doubled year-over-year to $2.395 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank and global wealth management divisions, which benefited from high market volatility. CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that while markets have recovered, client activity reflects a cautious wait-and-see attitude. The bank continues its integration of Credit Suisse and is navigating proposed stricter capital requirements from Swiss regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party will hold its key annual plenum in October to formulate the country's 15th five-year plan, setting economic and social goals for 2026-2030. The meeting of the party's elite Central Committee will take place amid ongoing tensions with the United States. The timing of the conclave, likely in the second half of October, precedes the APEC summit, which is seen as a potential opportunity for a meeting between Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to address their numerous differences.</p>

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England has concluded, but the underlying dispute with the government is far from over. Although talks under the new Labour government initially seemed promising, they broke down, leading to the walkout. The British Medical Association is seeking a 25% pay restoration to 2008 levels, while the government insists this year's pay is settled. Both sides have shown tentative signs of being willing to resume negotiations, focusing on non-pay issues like working conditions and exam fees.</p>

The researchers believe the creatures used hundreds of fine, bristle-like structures to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing.

By aligning with France, Britain is increasing Israel's diplomatic isolation and challenging the US position.

          <p>Los Angeles Rams safety and team captain Quentin Lake is entering the final year of his rookie contract with his future uncertain. While the Rams are reportedly in extension talks with running back Kyren Williams, Lake will likely have to play out the season before his situation is addressed. Historically, the Rams have not signed a safety they drafted to a second contract since their return to Los Angeles. Lake, a versatile and key part of the defense, remains focused on his on-field performance, believing his play will ultimately determine his future.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments to limit housing development in high-risk wildfire areas, exempting them from a key state housing law. The order will apply to neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area, such as Pacific Palisades, that were recently affected by fires. This move weakens Senate Bill 9, a 2021 law designed to increase housing density by allowing up to four units on single-family lots. The decision follows pressure from Los Angeles officials who raised concerns about increased population density complicating future fire evacuations.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East coast has generated tsunami waves, prompting warnings and advisories for coastal areas across the Pacific, from Russia and Japan to Hawaii and the Americas. The first waves, some reaching up to two feet, have already hit parts of Japan and Russia's Kuril Islands, causing some damage and evacuations. Authorities in Hawaii have opened shelters and observed water receding from harbors, a sign of incoming waves. The event is the strongest earthquake globally since the 2011 Japan quake, causing widespread caution.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save Americans billions in costs and increase consumer choice for vehicles. The decision has been met with strong opposition from environmental groups and former EPA officials, who argue it ignores overwhelming scientific evidence and will face legal challenges.

Smith then came through again in the ninth with a go-ahead RBI double, scoring the winning run. The victory marked the team's 37th come-from-behind win of the season and provided a much-needed boost for an offense that has recently struggled to capitalize in key situations.</p>

The decision to hold the policy steady follows two earlier easings in 2025 and comes as Singapore's GDP growth exceeded expectations in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has stated there is a "legal pathway" for Democrats to bypass the state's independent redistricting commission and present new congressional maps directly to voters. This controversial move would likely be done via a special election and is seen as a countermeasure to Republican efforts in other states to redraw districts in their favor. The proposal could help Democrats gain several seats in the U.S. House but has been sharply criticized by Republicans as an undemocratic power grab that would undermine the will of voters who established the independent commission.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate fell to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and below market expectations. This slowdown brings inflation to the lower end of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While the RBA has already cut rates twice this year, it held them steady in its last meeting to confirm the downward trend. Analysts now believe this new data provides sufficient evidence for the RBA to proceed with another cut. (not investment advice)</p>
