          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. military launched precision strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities: Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. The strikes were carried out using B-2 bombers and tomahawk missiles, targeting facilities buried deep underground and protected by air defenses. Trump warned Iran against retaliation, stating that any such action would be met with greater force. The U.S. communicated to Iran that these strikes were the extent of their planned actions and that regime change was not the objective.</p>

Hamas and the Houthis condemned the strikes and pledged to join Iran in retaliating against what they termed "American aggression." The Kremlin condemned the U.S. attacks as irresponsible and a violation of international law, while China warned against repeating the "Iraq mistake."</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S.'s direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, analysts believe that the U.S. will maintain its long-term strategic focus on containing China in the Indo-Pacific region. While the U.S. has repositioned some military assets to address the conflict, including temporarily diverting the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier, Washington has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to prioritizing strategic resources toward China. This suggests that the U.S. views China as a more significant long-term strategic challenge, despite immediate concerns in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Latino voters, while often focused on economic issues, will coalesce as an ethnic voting bloc when they perceive a serious threat to their community, as demonstrated by past political mobilizations. Escalating immigration raids and the deployment of military forces in Los Angeles have heightened fears among many Latinos. While economic dissatisfaction led more Latinos to vote for Trump, these actions could reverse that trend by activating deeper questions about belonging and acceptance in American society.</p>

          <p>While California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent speech criticizing President Trump has garnered praise, it is premature to overstate his potential in the 2028 presidential race. Newsom faces significant challenges, including homelessness, budget deficits, and income inequality, and his association with California's liberal policies could be a liability. Despite his efforts to confront Trump, Newsom's path to the White House remains uncertain due to the state's deep-seated problems and cultural idiosyncrasies.</p>
