          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight from Salt Lake City to Amsterdam was forced to make an emergency landing in Minneapolis after encountering severe turbulence over Wyoming. The incident resulted in 25 passengers being hospitalized for evaluation and care. According to a passenger, the plane experienced a drop of over 1,000 feet during one of three successive turbulent events. The Federal Aviation Administration has announced it will launch an investigation into the incident, which involved an Airbus A330-900 carrying 275 passengers and 13 crew members.</p>

The Labor Department reported that initial claims for the week ending July 26 increased by 1,000 to 218,000, which is below analysts' forecasts. This data suggests that businesses are continuing to retain their employees despite broader economic uncertainties. The four-week average, which smooths out weekly volatility, actually decreased, indicating a stable labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Edward Zakrzewski, a 60-year-old man convicted of killing his wife and two young children in 1994, is scheduled for execution by lethal injection in Florida. The execution would mark the state's ninth in 2025, setting a modern record for a single year. Opponents have highlighted Zakrzewski's military service and the non-unanimous 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence, which would not be permissible under current state law. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal for a stay, and Governor Ron DeSantis has signed warrants for two more executions in August.</p>

The administration has secured trade deals with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and several Asian countries, often involving baseline tariffs of 15-20% and significant investment pledges in the U.S. However, tensions remain high with other major partners, including China, where a temporary tariff truce is ending.

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments regarding President Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The case challenges the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the levies, a move previously blocked by a lower court. Challengers, including 12 states and several small businesses, argue that the president overstepped his constitutional authority, as Congress holds the power to set tariffs. The Trump administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies like trade deficits and drug trafficking, and to leverage better trade deals.</p>

The recognition is conditioned on significant reforms by the Palestinian Authority, including holding elections and demilitarization, and requires Hamas to release all hostages and have no role in future governance.

          <p>The World Meteorological Organization has officially confirmed a new world record for the longest single lightning flash, which stretched 515 miles across the U.S. Great Plains in October 2017. The massive bolt extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, Missouri. This record, along with another for the longest duration flash (17.1 seconds over Uruguay and Argentina), was documented using advanced space-based satellite mapping technology. Scientists note that these findings underscore the fact that lightning can travel very long distances from its parent thunderstorm, reinforcing the importance of seeking shelter during lightning storms.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote in Taiwan targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. Analysts suggest this outcome has, for now, averted a potential escalation in cross-strait tensions with Beijing. The recall campaign, framed by the ruling party as a battle to "resist China, protect Taiwan," could have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of overwhelming anti-China sentiment if successful. While a direct crisis may have been avoided, the result still points to a future of new political uncertainty within Taiwan and its relationship with mainland China.</p>

          <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has denied disaster assistance requests for three Kentucky counties that were heavily impacted by severe storms, claiming the damage did not meet the threshold for federal support. This decision is part of a broader pattern of denials from the agency, as the Trump administration aims to shift more disaster recovery responsibility to the states. The move has drawn criticism, with officials arguing that under-resourced state and local agencies cannot handle the escalating frequency and cost of climate-fueled catastrophes without federal funding and support for building resilience.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a White House request to rescind $7.9 billion in previously allocated foreign aid, but specific details on which programs will be cut remain unclear. The rescission package targets broad categories like global health, development assistance, and democracy funds, which the administration claims will eliminate wasteful spending. Aid organizations express deep concern, noting the cuts will decimate long-term development programs aimed at building resilience and self-reliance in low-income countries. A significant $142 million cut to UNICEF's core funding has also drawn shock and criticism from the aid community.</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations, largely boosted by the sale of its stake in Hulu to Disney. However, the company continued to struggle with its broadband business, losing 226,000 customers during the quarter despite a recent pivot in market strategy. A bright spot was its mobile division, which added a record 378,000 lines. The company's content and experiences division saw revenue growth, lifted by a strong box office performance and increased theme park attendance, while its Peacock streaming service saw its losses narrow significantly.

          <p>A Pennsylvania district attorney, Jason Walsh, is accused of pressuring a county coroner to classify an infant's death as a homicide to bolster his chances of reelection. A petition filed in the state Supreme Court alleges Walsh told the coroner, "I need this to be a homicide. I need it to win an election," regarding the 2022 death of 11-week-old Sawyer Clarke. The case highlights concerns that the death penalty is exploited for political advantage, as Walsh's office has sought capital punishment in 61% of homicide cases. The controversy also revives debate over the scientifically disputed diagnosis of shaken-baby syndrome.</p>

A survey of over 170,000 members revealed that 91% believe the 3.6% pay increase for this year is insufficient. Rather than demanding a higher raise, the union is focused on reforming the NHS contract to prevent nurses from being stuck on low pay bands that don't reflect their skills. The government has expressed disappointment with the dissatisfaction but stated it is willing to discuss contract reform, though not headline pay.</p>
