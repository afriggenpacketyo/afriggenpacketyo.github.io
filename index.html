          <p>Secret Syrian intelligence files, uncovered by the BBC, confirm that missing US journalist Austin Tice was imprisoned by the Assad regime. The files, verified by the BBC and law enforcement, consist of communications from different branches of Syrian intelligence. One top-secret communication shows Tice was held in a Damascus detention facility in 2012, corroborated by former Syrian officials. Tice was arrested near Damascus and held by the National Defence Forces until at least February 2013, receiving medical treatment for a viral infection, and while he was treated better than other Syrian detainees, he appeared sad and joyless. </p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, accused of murder in the mushroom lunch case, testified that she unintentionally served poison to family members and then "panicked." Prosecutors argue she intentionally cooked death cap mushrooms for her relatives before lying to police and disposing of evidence. Patterson stated that her relationship with the Patterson family had become more distant and that she and her estranged husband struggled to communicate when they disagreed. She also recounted the traumatic birth of her first child, detailing an emergency caesarean. </p>

          <p>Conservative Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski. The outcome suggests Poland will likely take a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki, who was endorsed by President Trump. Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises may be hindered due to Duda's veto power, and this win will further impede Tusk's agenda. Nawrocki, a 42-year-old historian, has been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, and his win has been lauded by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. </p>
