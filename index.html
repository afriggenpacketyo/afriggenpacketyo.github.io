          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple willfully violated a court injunction in an antitrust case filed by Epic Games, accusing the company of anticompetitive conduct and pricing.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Apple must loosen its grip on its App Store and stop collecting a commission on some app sales, capping a five-year antitrust case brought by Epic Games. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rebuked Apple for thwarting a previous ruling and accused executives of lying. Apple must allow apps to provide external links to pay developers directly for services, avoiding the 30 percent commission. The ruling has the potential to change the app economy, increasing money for developers while reducing fees for Apple.</p>

          <p>A US district judge has found Apple wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games, and has referred the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate whether a criminal contempt proceeding is appropriate. The 2021 case argued that third-party payment options should be available to customers and challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases, arguing that the App Store was monopolistic. The judge stated that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to address the US economy's contraction, which occurred for the first time in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. Trump attributed the downturn to companies stockpiling imports ahead of his tariff implementation and blamed his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, following a 2.4% growth in the previous quarter. The situation unfolds as Trump marks 100 days in office, with public opinion polls reflecting discontent over his economic stewardship.</p>

Japan's support for ASEAN countries, including defense capabilities enhancement through the "official security assistance" program, is seen as beneficial for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and peace in the South China Sea.

While answering questions at the end of a Cabinet meeting, Trump seemed to acknowledge the real impacts his trade war with China could have on Americans. Trump has previously said that there would be disruptions, but for the first time, he acknowledged that many Americans might have to do with less as a result of the tariff standoff. He argued that the result of the trade war will be worse for the Chinese, who rely on the U.S. as a market to sell their goods.</p>

The vote highlights the deep divisions over trade policy and the lengths to which the administration is willing to go to implement its agenda. The president has remained defiant in the face of congressional criticism, previously vowing to veto any such resolution if necessary.</p>

The preliminary vote supports increases of 1.75 to 4.75 percent on one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases, with a final decision expected in the next two months. Tenant advocates argue the increases will worsen the housing crisis, while landlords claim the increases are insufficient to cover rising expenses.
