          <p>China's export growth in May missed estimates, primarily due to a significant drop in shipments to the U.S., despite a temporary trade truce.

Chinese exports to the U.S. fell by 34.5%, offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the EU, and Africa.

          <p>President Trump and California Governor Newsom are in conflict over the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, with differing interpretations of the Posse Comitatus Act. This act generally restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, but exceptions exist. Trump deployed the National Guard after attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, while Newsom argues the deployment infringes on state sovereignty. The dispute highlights the legal complexities and political tensions surrounding federal intervention in state law enforcement matters.</p>
