          <p>Following her divorce from Cash Warren, actress Jessica Alba has been photographed on vacation in Riviera Maya, Mexico. The 44-year-old shared several bikini photos on social media, showcasing her physique and appearing to enjoy her single life. Her trip comes amid rumors of a new romance after she was seen with "Top Gun: Maverick" actor Danny Ramirez in Cancun. Sources suggest that while Alba is receiving attention and has been on some dates, she is not currently in a serious relationship and is focusing on herself and her children.</p>

          <p>An initiative to create a safer environment for aid distribution in Gaza by designating a "women-only" day resulted in chaos and death. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's event in Rafah reportedly became uncontrollable, with accounts of pepper spray and stun grenades being used on the crowd. At least two women, Mary Sheikh al-Eid and Khadija Abu Anza, were killed by gunfire during the mayhem. A former US soldier working with the aid system described witnessing "brutality and use of indiscriminate force" against a starving population, a claim the IDF disputes.</p>

          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India demonstrated strong resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 165-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets, an unbroken partnership between KL Rahul (87) and Captain Shubman Gill (78) blunted the English attack. Earlier, England's captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141, helping his team to a formidable total of 669. Despite England remaining favorites to win the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

These findings appear to contradict repeated claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify a new, controversial aid distribution system.

          <p>According to a BBC analysis by Jeremy Bowen, Israel's offer to allow airdrops of aid into Gaza is an act of desperation that will not solve the growing hunger crisis. While it may be a political gesture to allies, airdrops are a crude and inefficient method of delivery, carrying far less than truck convoys and often landing inaccurately. Past experiences in conflict zones like Iraqi Kurdistan and Bosnia have shown that airdrops can lead to civilian deaths and chaos on the ground. The article argues that only a sustained, unrestricted ground-based aid operation can effectively address starvation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) is reportedly using an artificial intelligence tool to identify federal regulations for elimination, according to internal documents. The "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is said to be analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting 50% of them by the first anniversary of a potential second Trump inauguration. The initiative is part of President Trump's campaign promise for the "most aggressive regulatory reduction" in history. A White House spokesperson confirmed that "all options are being explored" to enhance government efficiency, but no single plan has been finalized.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Varna's mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, a member of the reformist PP party, has triggered protests in Bulgaria amid concerns that the government is weaponizing the justice system. Kotsev was accused of running a criminal group, but critics claim the charges are politically motivated and orchestrated by the ruling conservative GERB party and its allies. Protesters in Varna and Sofia argue that the arrest is part of a broader, authoritarian trend to undermine democracy and silence opposition. The European Commission has previously noted a lack of improvement in Bulgaria's rule of law.</p>

          <p>Former NBC Cable President Tom Rogers, previously a self-described "raging bull" on Netflix, has expressed new concerns about the streaming giant's future. Rogers points to a decline in viewing time per subscriber and growing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. While Netflix's recent earnings were strong, he argues that engagement is the key driver of its business model. He also predicts that AI will be a "double-edged sword," helping Netflix with costs but also empowering independent creators on YouTube to produce professional-quality content.

These chemicals, which do not break down in the environment, are linked to serious health issues, including cancer and fertility problems.

          <p>Following President Trump's directive to release grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, legal experts are cautioning that the files may not reveal significant new information. Veteran attorneys told The Guardian that grand jury transcripts are only a small part of the overall investigation and may not provide much insight into Epstein's crimes or potential co-conspirators. They argue that more meaningful information exists in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal Justice Department memos. The move is seen as an attempt at damage control by a White House engulfed in speculation about Trump's ties to Epstein.</p>
