          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks struck Ukraine overnight, killing at least four people and injuring twenty more in cities including Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region. The assault damaged residential buildings and infrastructure, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew his urgent appeals for additional Western air defense systems, specifically U.S.-made Patriots. The Ukrainian air force reported intercepting a majority of the projectiles, while Russia claimed to have shot down numerous Ukrainian drones over its own territory. This latest escalation highlights the ongoing need for advanced military aid to protect Ukrainian cities from relentless aerial bombardment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report reveals that over one-third of Manhattan condo apartments resold in the last year were sold at a loss, a stark contrast to the broader U.S. housing market's gains. According to research from Brown Harris Stevens, the median price per square foot for these properties has remained stagnant for a decade, with losses likely being even greater when accounting for inflation and transaction costs. While the ultra-luxury segment of the market has continued to see profits, factors like tax law changes and pandemic-era migration have contributed to the overall price weakness. This trend highlights the unique challenges facing New York City's real estate market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of two former NBA players in a rigged poker scheme allegedly involving La Cosa Nostra crime families, Meyer Lansky II offered his perspective on the connection. The grandson of the famous mobster speculated that high-adrenaline, risk-taking athletes can be drawn to gambling and the perceived power associated with mafia affiliations. He noted that sports have historically been a target for fixing schemes due to being less risky than casino operations. Lansky II suggests that despite the legalization of sports betting, illegal operations persist because they can offer protection and exert powerful influence over players.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Explores Motivations Behind Trump's Demolition of White House East Wing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article critiques President Trump's sudden decision to demolish the 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to construct a new $300 million ballroom. The author argues the move, executed without submitted plans or public input, reflects a pattern of acting on personal whims without regard for historical preservation or established norms. The project is reportedly funded by private donors, including major tech and defense corporations, raising questions of influence. The piece speculates that beyond ego, the large-scale project may hint at Trump's intentions to challenge presidential term limits, a notion floated by the president and his allies.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant drop in the number of active serial killers since their peak in the 1970s, public fascination with them remains high, fueling speculation in cases like the drownings in Austin's Lady Bird Lake. Criminologists attribute the decline to factors like the end of the hitchhiking era, widespread cellphone use, and advancements in DNA technology that allow for quicker identification of perpetrators. However, popular culture continues to feed the obsession through documentaries and series about past killers. This article explores the psychological and societal need for such "monsters," which serve as a canvas for projecting societal fears and values, even as the real-world threat has largely been supplanted by mass shootings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated he does not plan to name the new $300 million White House ballroom after himself, calling earlier reports suggesting otherwise "fake news." He indicated a name like "the presidential ballroom" is more likely, though a final decision has not been made. This denial comes despite senior administration officials previously telling reporters the new space was already being referred to as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom."

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean. The move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, which the Pentagon claims is to augment counter-narcotics operations. However, President Trump's recent accusations against Maduro as a drug-trafficking leader and hints at potential "land action" have fueled fears in Venezuela that the buildup is aimed at regime change. Analysts suggest the military show of force is likely intended to pressure Maduro's inner circle rather than signal an imminent invasion.</p>

The commemoration is viewed as a strategic move by the Chinese Communist Party to reinforce its sovereignty claims over the self-ruled island.

This economic disconnect is reflected in the stock market, where a few AI-related tech companies drive gains while consumer-focused sectors lag.

While some research suggests saturated fats may be more neutral than previously believed, especially compared to sugars, experts warn that a blanket recommendation to eat more could have adverse public health effects.

While AI is being used for tasks like dubbing and animation, it has not yet replaced jobs or produced feature films as some predicted.

          <p>Voters in Ivory Coast are casting ballots in a presidential election where 83-year-old incumbent Alassane Ouattara is favored to win a fourth term. The election follows a tense run-up in which several key opposition figures, including former President Laurent Gbagbo and former Credit Suisse executive Tidjane Thiam, were barred from running, leading to protests and arrests. Ouattara, a former IMF official, campaigns on a record of economic growth and stability, while his four lesser-known challengers have focused on job creation. With over 40,000 security personnel deployed, authorities are hoping to avoid the violence that has marred past elections.</p>

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital, Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally acquire two kilograms of uranium. According to the agency, the suspects intended to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material and planned to transport it back to China via Russia. The operation was reportedly coordinated by other members of a criminal group based in China. Authorities stated that the individuals were detained while negotiating the final details of the illicit transaction. The security service released video of the arrests but did not specify when they occurred or the identities of the suspects.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) suggesting a rise in far-left terrorism in the first half of 2025 has ignited controversy among counterterrorism experts. While the Trump administration has claimed the primary domestic threat is from the left, data has historically shown the far-right to be more lethal. Critics of the CSIS study argue its conclusions are based on a very small number of incidents and that the methodology for categorizing political violence is highly subjective. The debate highlights the complexities of tracking domestic terrorism and the lack of a unified, official database, leading to varied interpretations of the current threat landscape.</p>

          <p>China's dominance over the global supply of rare earth elements, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing and defense, remains a significant challenge for the U.S. and Europe. Beijing recently tightened export controls on these materials, escalating trade tensions and highlighting the vulnerability of Western supply chains. Despite efforts to diversify, progress has been slow due to the economic and environmental hurdles of developing new mining and processing facilities. Experts note that China's near-monopoly on refining, especially for heavy rare earths, along with its technical expertise, makes it difficult for other nations to build a competitive, independent supply chain in the near future.</p>

This trend, particularly strong among younger investors, reflects a growing disillusionment with conventional portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a practical way to gain exposure to alternatives like real estate or commodities without the liquidity issues of direct private investment. Despite the interest in alternatives, experts still recommend that the core of long-term investment portfolios for goals like retirement should remain in diversified, traditional assets.

The election was initiated after Angela Rayner's resignation last month.

In her victory speech, Powell called for the party to be "bolder" and vowed to be an ally to Starmer while also bringing critical perspectives to the heart of the party's leadership.</p>

Such a diversion of arms could violate international agreements like the Arms Trade Treaty, which holds signatory nations accountable for how imported weapons are used.

          <p>President Trump abruptly canceled the planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following direct phone calls from Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying by billionaire tech CEOs, including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. Trump stated he was giving the city a "shot" to handle its issues after the mayor asked him "very nicely" not to send troops. The incident has drawn criticism for basing a domestic military deployment on the capricious whims of the president and the influence of his wealthy friends. While the immediate crisis was averted for San Francisco, the situation highlights the unconventional and personalized nature of the administration's decision-making process.</p>

          <p>California will allow the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans starting January 1, following the passage of a new law aimed at protecting the state's wetlands. Wildlife officials argue that the large, aggressive birds degrade fragile habitats and displace native waterfowl. Mute swans, introduced to North America in the 1800s, consume large amounts of aquatic vegetation and can disrupt entire ecosystems. While the law is supported by conservation groups like the California Waterfowl Association, animal advocacy organizations have condemned it as inhumane and an effort to expand hunting opportunities rather than a genuine conservation measure.</p>

          <p>California wildlife officials have euthanized four gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack in response to an unprecedented number of cattle kills in the Sierra Valley. These four wolves were responsible for 70 livestock losses since March, prompting the decision after non-lethal hazing methods failed to deter them. The move highlights the growing conflict between ranchers and the state's recovering wolf population, which is protected under endangered species laws. Officials stated the pack had become dangerously reliant on cattle, a habit that threatened long-term wolf recovery by altering natural feeding patterns and drawing the predators closer to human communities.</p>

In regions like the Mississippi Delta, where poverty is high and health care access is limited, residents and providers fear the cuts will reverse recent gains in insurance coverage.
