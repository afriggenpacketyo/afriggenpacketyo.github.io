          <p>The FAA is investigating a 90-second communication outage at the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center, during which controllers had to use backup frequencies to relay instructions to pilots. According to the agency, the outage did not impact operations or aircraft separation. This incident follows similar disruptions at a Philadelphia facility affecting Newark Airport, raising concerns about the aging infrastructure of the air traffic control system. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has acknowledged the need for system upgrades, noting reliance on eBay and 3D printing for replacement parts, and the Trump administration is pushing for a multi-billion dollar overhaul to address these issues. The article emphasizes that while these incidents raise concerns, the FAA maintains that air travel remains safe due to multiple redundancies. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's foreign policy in the Middle East is taking a different approach to Israel compared to his predecessor, Joe Biden. While maintaining pro-Israel rhetoric and policies domestically, Trump appears less concerned with aligning with Israel on regional issues and has engaged in direct negotiations with Israel's adversaries, including Hamas and Iran, without Israeli input. This shift has surprised the Israeli government, which expected stronger support following Trump's reelection. Analysts suggest Trump's approach reflects a broader skepticism toward allies and a growing influence of Republican foreign policy restrainers who prioritize reducing America's military footprint, potentially leading to increased tensions in the US-Israel relationship. The article conveys a sense of diplomatic realignment and uncertainty in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria after 45 years has generated hope among Syrians for economic relief, reconstruction, and the return of refugees. The Syrian Foreign Ministry hailed the move as a pivotal opportunity for stability and self-sufficiency.

While Trump urged Syria to undertake several actions, including recognizing Israel and combating terrorism, there has been no official confirmation from Damascus regarding the Abraham Accords.

          <p>Seniors may find it beneficial to explore certain insurance policies this spring to enhance their financial protection. Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs not fully covered by traditional Medicare, while long-term care insurance can provide financial assistance for nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from during their lifetime and provides a payout to beneficiaries after death. The article advises seniors to research their options and obtain quotes sooner rather than later, as coverage costs generally increase with age. </p>

Miami-Dade County had already voted to remove fluoride from its water supply.

          <p>A new genetics study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers, and their cultures exist in the genes of modern Indigenous groups. The early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, providing a new genetic and cultural understanding of present-day South American communities. Researchers say the findings are helping underrepresented Indigenous groups understand their ancestral origins.</p>

          <p>Walmart has reported solid sales but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs will lead to price increases for consumers. CEO Doug McMillon stated that the company will try to keep prices low but cannot absorb all the tariff costs. Shoppers could see price increases as soon as the end of the month, affecting discretionary items like electronics and toys. The article suggests that Walmart is more insulated from tariff-induced cost increases than many competitors due to its large grocery business and domestic sourcing. </p>

          <p>Settling credit card debt can provide relief but also carries long-term consequences for accessing future credit. Credit card issuers view debt settlement as a red flag, making it difficult to obtain new credit cards.

Monitoring credit reports, starting with a secured credit card, and becoming an authorized user on a trusted account can improve creditworthiness.

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on President Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order to end birthright citizenship. The court is considering the legality of individual judges blocking presidential policy nationwide.

Justice Sotomayor said the order violates Supreme Court precedents. The case is expected to address the legality of judges single-handedly blocking presidential policy nationwide.</p>
