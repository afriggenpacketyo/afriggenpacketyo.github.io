        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of U.S. states, including Arkansas, are debating legislation to ban or limit the addition of fluoride to public drinking water, challenging a practice established in the 1940s. Proponents, like the American Dental Association, cite over 70 years of research proving its effectiveness in preventing tooth decay, particularly in children. However, critics raise concerns about potential health risks at high exposure levels, such as links to lower IQs in children, which recent federal studies have suggested with moderate confidence. This renewed debate places local water districts at the center of a contentious public health issue.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old from Florida, has made history by becoming the oldest person to officially complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through Death Valley. He finished the race, known as one of the world's toughest, in under the 48-hour cutoff time, running through extreme heat that reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit. Becker, who only began running in his late 50s, attributes his success to focused training, a dedicated support crew, and a resilient mindset. His journey demonstrates remarkable physical endurance and personal determination at an advanced age.</p>

          <p>In response to heightened immigration enforcement, some migrant workers are using mobile apps like Coqui to track the real-time locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Users, including those with legal status, report feeling traumatized and fearful of potential detention, and they rely on the apps to navigate their work routes more safely. ICE officials have condemned these applications, stating they are dangerous and could impede law enforcement efforts or be used to ambush agents. The app's developer created it to help workers, who were afraid to leave their homes, get to their jobs.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy companies will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to foster a new economy based on artificial intelligence and energy. The investments will fund the construction of energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for workforce training, aiming to create tens of thousands of jobs. The initiative, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, seeks to leverage the state's natural gas and nuclear resources to power AI development. While praised by industry leaders, the summit faced protests from activists concerned about its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robin Kaye, a long-time music supervisor for "American Idol," and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found shot to death in their Encino home. A 22-year-old suspect, Raymond Boodarian, has been arrested in connection with the murders. Authorities believe the incident was a burglary that turned violent when the couple returned home and confronted the intruder. The investigation suggests the suspect entered the fortified home without force on July 10, days before the victims were discovered during a welfare check. The "American Idol" community expressed devastation over the loss of Kaye, a respected member of their team.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General, Paulo Gonet, has formally requested the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty for his role in an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss. In a detailed filing, Gonet accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" that sought to violently overthrow the democratic order. The charges stem from Bolsonaro's unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, the former president could face up to 40 years in prison, a development that has drawn concern from his ally, President Trump.</p>

          <p>The UK government has disclosed that a secret scheme, the Afghan Relocation Route, was established after a Ministry of Defence official inadvertently leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants in 2022.

Both the data breach and the subsequent £400m relocation program were concealed from the public by a super-injunction. Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a sincere apology for the "serious departmental error," which is now under scrutiny after a court lifted the gag order.</p>

His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the L.A. County D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with Indonesia, averting a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods. Under the new agreement, the tariff rate will be lowered to 19%. In exchange, Trump stated that the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has agreed to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. This pact is the latest development in the administration's aggressive trade strategy, which has involved threatening steep tariffs to bring numerous countries, including major allies, to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>Forty-six years after he was executed for treason, South Korea's former spy chief Kim Jae-gyu is being retried for the 1979 assassination of authoritarian President Park Chung-hee. Kim, who was a close friend of the president, shot Park during a dinner, an act that ended 18 years of military dictatorship. His family fought for the retrial, arguing he was a patriot who acted to prevent further bloodshed and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The court agreed to the retrial based on evidence that Kim was tortured into a confession, reigniting a national debate about his legacy and the country's turbulent path to democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff vehemently denied the claim, calling it a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The accusation is based on a Fannie Mae memo which noted Schiff listed homes in both Maryland and California as primary residences at different times, but did not use the word "fraud." Schiff's spokesperson stated that all lenders were aware of his bi-coastal living arrangement, which is common for members of Congress.</p>

Johnson stated, "we should put everything out there and let the people decide," adding that Attorney General Pam Bondi needs to explain her handling of the case. This comes as the Trump administration faces a rare backlash from its base over the belief that details of Epstein's crimes are being suppressed. Trump has urged his supporters to move on from the issue, while Johnson and other Republicans are now advocating for greater transparency.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a more cautious approach to the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv "shouldn't" use weapons to strike Moscow. This comment follows reports that Trump had asked Ukrainian President Zelenskyy if it were possible to hit Moscow and St. Petersburg, a question the White House claims was taken out of context. The statement marks a shift in tone after Trump recently threatened Russia with severe tariffs if it doesn't move to end the war within 50 days. The administration's evolving stance has created uncertainty among allies and analysts about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine's war effort.</p>

However, Judge Sean Jordan ruled that the CFPB had exceeded its authority. Consumer health advocates called the decision a setback that sides with corporate interests, while credit industry groups praised it for protecting the integrity of the financial system by providing lenders with a fuller picture of a consumer's ability to pay.

Critics argue that the administration is dismantling the government's ability to handle disasters by cutting climate research, canceling infrastructure grants, and gutting forecasting agencies.
