          <p>Multiple people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, at a pro-Israel event when a suspect attacked them with what witnesses described as Molotov cocktails. The incident occurred at the Pearl Street Mall, and the suspect is now in custody, with authorities investigating a vehicle of interest at the scene. The FBI is involved, and the attack is being investigated as a possible act of terror, though local police are not yet labeling it as such. Colorado's Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack as a heinous act of terror, and Run For Their Lives, the group organizing the walk, has canceled upcoming events. The incident is currently under investigation to determine the attacker's motives.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the January 6 Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the pardon. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her involvement, believes that accepting the pardon would contribute to a false narrative surrounding the events of January 6. She is working with Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon and has received confirmation from the Department of Justice that her non-acceptance is noted. Hemphill has been critical of other January 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons and has sparred with them on social media about what she sees as a whitewashing of the event.</p>

          <p>South Korea is holding a snap election on June 3 amidst economic and political shocks following President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law decree. Voters are seeking stability and a leader who can calm the economic downturn and protests that have plagued the country. Liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in the polls, promising to restore stability, while conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo is campaigning on deregulation. The martial law declaration has negatively impacted businesses and consumer sentiment, potentially leading to a significant loss of votes for the ruling conservative party.

          <p>A surprising number of Hollywood stars are Australian, and this article explores why the country produces so much acting talent. NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, is a key factor, instilling a "can do, will tell, you know, don't wait for permission" attitude. Australian actors are known for their skill, confidence, and courage, as well as a lack of self-indulgence. The country's remoteness allows actors to develop their talents away from Hollywood's intense scrutiny. The Australian film industry also provides a good training ground for actors to hone their skills.</p>

Scheffler's win marks his third victory in his last four tournaments, following his recent triumph at the PGA Championship. This victory also makes him the second player to win the Memorial in consecutive years.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has amplified an outlandish conspiracy theory by reposting a false claim that President Joe Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. This action continues Trump's pattern of promoting misinformation and unsubstantiated claims, further fueling political division. The spread of such conspiracy theories raises concerns about the erosion of trust in institutions and the potential for real-world harm.</p>

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm forecast for Sunday night may make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm is caused by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. While the ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>
