          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark will be sidelined for her fifth consecutive game against the Los Angeles Sparks due to a persistent groin injury. This marks the ninth regular-season game the rookie has missed this year, a notable number for a player who had no prior injury history in her college or professional career. Head coach Stephanie White indicated that while Clark has participated in some drills, she has not yet returned to full-speed practice, with the team holding a 9-8 record.</p>

          <p>Severe thunderstorms have caused catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas, resulting in at least 13 fatalities, including children.

A significant concern is the 23 campers from Camp Mystic who remain unaccounted for, prompting a large-scale search effort as authorities urge residents to shelter in place and seek higher ground.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell seized vehicles just 15 days after towing them. Critics argue the law is predatory, disproportionately affecting working-class individuals who may struggle to pay impound fees on short notice. The article highlights the case of a Waterbury couple who lost their car and profiles a specific company, MyHoopty.com LLC, accused of targeting lower-income apartment complexes to enforce parking rules and profit from the quick sales.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates taxes on Social Security, the reality is more nuanced. The legislation does not repeal the tax but instead introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older, which applies to their total income, not just their benefits. Policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors, as many low-income recipients already pay no federal income tax. The measure could also increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, highlighting the overlooked importance of these creatures in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>Germany secured a 2-0 victory against Poland in their opening match of Women's Euro 2025, with goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. However, the win was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two previous ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting doubt on her ability to continue in the tournament for the eight-time champions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will implement tiered pricing at U.S. national parks, charging foreign tourists higher entry fees than American residents. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. citizens in park lotteries and permitting, with the extra revenue from foreign visitors intended for infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion initiatives in the management and storytelling within the national park system.</p>

          <p>This article explores the dynamic between India and China within Global South-focused organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS. While China often seeks a leadership role, the consensus-based decision-making rules of these groups allow India to act as a significant counterbalance. A recent SCO defense ministers' meeting highlighted this tension, as a lack of consensus, reportedly due to India's position on terrorism language, prevented the adoption of a joint statement, underscoring ongoing geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks outlines five food categories he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and deli slices because of preservatives and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, recommending healthier, home-prepared alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins instead.</p>
