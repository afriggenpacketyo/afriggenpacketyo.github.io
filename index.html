Andrew Macdonald will become chief operating officer, overseeing global mobility, delivery, autonomous businesses, and cross-platform functions.

          <p>Negotiations for a cease-fire in Gaza have stalled due to a fundamental disagreement between Hamas and Israel, as Hamas insists on a permanent truce, while Israel prefers a temporary one. This divergence has been a persistent obstacle throughout the 18 months of negotiations aimed at ending the ongoing conflict. The wide gap in their demands has effectively stymied any progress toward a resolution. The impasse highlights the complexities and deep-seated issues preventing a lasting peace agreement between the two parties.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and constructing them after being denied the purchase of a gun. According to court documents, Soliman allegedly told police he wanted to kill all Zionist people and had been planning the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation. Twelve victims were injured in the attack, with six hospitalized, as Soliman is in the United States illegally after his visa expired.</p>

The victims included four women and four men ranging in age from 52 to 88, with one in critical condition, as witnesses reported the suspect also yelled "End Zionist!" during the attack.

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in effect, a decision celebrated by gun-safety advocates. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing a desire to address the issue nationwide, while Justice Kavanaugh acknowledged the appeals court ruling as "questionable" but agreed with the decision to let the Maryland law stand for now. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons.

          <p>Six Nobel laureate economists have criticized a budget bill passed by the House, stating that it would significantly increase the national debt and exacerbate inequality. The economists argue that the bill's cuts to Medicaid and food stamps would negatively impact millions of Americans while tax cuts would disproportionately benefit higher-income households. Senator Rand Paul has also voiced concerns about the bill's increased spending, particularly for the military and border security. The White House Council of Economic Advisers, however, claims the Trump administration's policies will stimulate growth and reduce the deficit (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a second court ruling that blocked President Trump's sweeping tariff plan, arguing that it undermines his ability to negotiate trade deals. The administration's appeal, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, follows a similar challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) in New York, both centered on Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Economists suggest the tariffs are more of a negotiating tactic than actual policy, as William Cline of the Peterson Institute for International Economics noted that the administration needs to use the tariffs as a credible threat in trade talks. The White House has indicated it may take the fight to the Supreme Court if necessary (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the U.S. Department of Education, renewing the commitment to reduce the department's role. While Title I funding remains unchanged, the budget proposes consolidating and cutting funding for various K-12 programs, impacting teacher training, at-risk students, and rural schools. The proposal also suggests a cut to the maximum amount of Federal Pell Grants for low-income students. The budget summary reflects an agency that is winding down its operations.</p>
