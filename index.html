          <h2>MPs Warn of Dire Consequences of Social Care Inaction in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 23:05:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that the failure to reform England's social care system for older and disabled adults is financially and humanly unsustainable. The cross-party MPs highlight that taxpayers are currently paying Â£32 billion annually for a broken system reliant on unpaid carers. The committee emphasizes that social care is integral to NHS reforms and recommends annual assessments of unmet care needs and the costs of delayed discharges. Investing an additional Â£1 billion in social care could create 50,000 jobs and generate a Â£1.75 return to the wider economy, according to the report.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's anti-corruption crackdown on top military officials in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does not indicate weak control by President Xi Jinping. The campaign's impact on military readiness and modernization is considered limited, and internal competition among Xi's supporters may be a factor. Recent targets include members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), including Miao Hua, who oversaw Communist Party ideology and personnel changes. The investigations into high-ranking officials highlight Xi's focus on maintaining control and eliminating potential threats within the military.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States, citing concerns that the American film industry is "dying" due to incentives offered by other countries. Trump described this as a "national security threat," arguing that foreign-made films could be used for messaging and propaganda. This announcement follows China's recent decision to reduce the number of US films it imports. Trump also mentioned Stephen Miller as a potential successor to Mike Waltz as national security adviser, amidst the "Signalgate" scandal.</p>

The IDF aims to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and defeat militants, though critics question the effectiveness of recent offensives. The military plans to operate in new areas and destroy infrastructure both above and below ground, but reports suggest the expansion will wait until after President Trump's visit.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has closed its last in-house beagle laboratory on the NIH campus, following public scrutiny and pressure from figures like Elon Musk. A report highlighted alleged abuses, including pumping pneumonia-causing bacteria into beagles' lungs and bleeding them out for experiments. PETA praised the closure, with the NIH director noting that PETA sent him flowers, a stark contrast to the usual physical threats NIH directors receive. The closure aligns with broader efforts to phase out animal testing, including actions by the FDA and EPA during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he will not seek a third term in office, acknowledging the constitutional limitations preventing him from doing so. Trump mentioned that while some people desire him to serve a third term, he intends to serve for eight years and then pass the presidency to a great Republican. In the same interview, Trump expressed uncertainty about whether he needs to uphold constitutional due process and did not rule out using military force to control Greenland.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has advocated for the reopening of Alcatraz prison to house the most dangerous criminals in the United States. Trump argued that the country has been plagued by violent and repeat offenders, and the reopening of Alcatraz would symbolize law, order, and justice. The prison, located on an island off the coast of California, was closed in 1963 due to high operating costs. The Bureau of Prisons stated it would comply with all presidential orders regarding the facility.</p>

          <p>An exhibit honoring victims of gun violence has been removed from the headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The exhibit, which featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence, was dedicated in April 2024 by the Biden administration, with plans to add 200 new honorees each year. The Justice Department suggested it will continue to honor victims of violent crime, but not exclusively gun violence. Advocates view the removal as a political decision by the Trump administration to roll back firearms regulations.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, known for his comically genteel role as Sheriff Tom Brewster in the 1950s TV western "Sugarfoot," passed away at the age of 94. After his Hollywood career waned, Hutchins became a traveling clown, performing around the world. Hutchins played Brewster as a non-violent sheriff who preferred cherry soda over whiskey and often lectured Westerners about their dispositions. He also appeared in Elvis Presley films and a Monte Hellman western. Hutchins is survived by his wife, Barbara Torres, and a daughter, Jennifer.</p>
