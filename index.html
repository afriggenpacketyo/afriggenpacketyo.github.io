        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the common stereotype that straight men are inept at gossiping, delving into the underlying reasons and implications of this perception. It references studies, including one from 2019, that debunk the myth that women gossip more negatively than men, while highlighting that women engage in neutral gossip more frequently. The piece suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossiping stems from fewer cultural opportunities to engage in open and free-flowing social discussions. Ultimately, the article posits that improving men's ability to gossip could potentially alleviate the male loneliness epidemic by fostering deeper connections and intimacy. The article also touches upon the idea that men fear incriminating themselves by sharing personal stories with others, which inhibits their ability to form close friendships.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official cautioned that any U.S. intervention in the conflict with Israel risks escalating it into an "all-out war." This warning comes as the conflict between the two nations enters its sixth day, marked by exchanges of missile strikes and escalating tensions. Israel claims to have struck a centrifuge production site intended to enhance Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Iran retaliated with missile launches towards Israel, which were largely intercepted, as authorities in both countries reported rising casualties and evacuations from major cities. The United States has sent additional warplanes to Europe, suggesting potential preparation for a greater role in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Olympic fencing team head coach Andrey Geva has filed a lawsuit against USA Fencing Chair Damien Lehfeldt, alleging Lehfeldt made false statements to Congress regarding trans athletes. Geva claims Lehfeldt's assertion that transgender status doesn't confer an inherent advantage over cisgender fencers is untrue, citing his experience coaching both male and female fencers at the highest international levels. The lawsuit seeks Lehfeldt's removal as chair, asserting that his statements risk the organization's status and have alienated members.

Recent attacks have already impacted oil infrastructure, with damage to Israel's Bazan oil refinery and partial suspension of production at Iran's South Pars gas field.

          <p>Following a school shooting in Graz that killed 10 people, the Austrian government is implementing stricter gun control measures. The reforms include raising the minimum age for purchasing dangerous firearms from 21 to 25 and extending the waiting period between purchase and receipt to four weeks. Newly issued gun permits will expire after eight years, and more emphasis will be placed on psychological tests for gun owners. The government also plans to increase the number of school psychologists to identify potential dangers early. These measures aim to prevent future tragedies by making access to dangerous weapons more difficult.</p>

          <p>The Premier League has released its 2025-26 season fixtures, but a warning has been issued regarding potential game rescheduling due to European matches. With nine English teams participating in European competitions, including six in the Champions League, there is an increased likelihood of fixtures being moved with relatively short notice. This situation presents challenges for team managers, especially with international windows and long midweek away trips. The first expanded lot of TV fixtures will require careful consideration to avoid conflicts with Champions League matches.

          <p>Manufacturers are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duties amid rising tariffs, by altering product materials or dimensions to fit into different harmonized system codes. This practice involves strategically redesigning products to qualify for lower tariff rates, which is not inherently illegal. Companies in sectors like consumer goods and garments find it easier to implement such changes. However, heavily regulated industries like automotive and aerospace face greater challenges due to extensive testing and approval requirements. A Supreme Court ruling from 1882 deemed this practice legal as long as the goods are honestly presented to customs officials. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump has demanded Iran's "unconditional surrender" and claimed that the U.S. and Israel have "total and complete control of the skies over Iran." Israel believes the U.S. will eventually join the offensive against Iran and is awaiting a formal decision from Washington. The rising tensions suggest a potential escalation of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to their lowest level since April, mortgage demand has decreased, indicating weak consumer sentiment in the housing market. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 3% last week, even as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.84%. Economic uncertainty is weighing on potential homebuyers' decisions, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications to refinance a home loan also declined, despite the drop in rates.

          <p>Destroying Iran's nuclear program is a difficult task due to the fortified nature of facilities like the Fordow plant, built inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete. Only the U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber capable of deploying it. Military experts suggest that multiple bombing rounds and potential ground deployment may be necessary to ensure complete destruction of the facility. A U.S. strike could trigger Iranian retaliation against U.S. assets in the region, potentially escalating the conflict.

The new law addresses cases where women ended pregnancies outside approved rules, such as buying pills online.
