          <p>A Mexican mother, part of a group searching for missing relatives, and her son were murdered in Jalisco state, a region known for criminal violence. Maria del Carmen Morales, a member of the Guerreros Buscadores collective, was killed defending her son from attackers; another of her sons went missing the previous year. The collective is known for discovering remains at a suspected drug cartel training camp, highlighting the issue of forced recruitment and disappearances in Mexico, where over 120,000 people are missing. Authorities are investigating the murders, though initial indications suggest they are unrelated to Morales's activism. Optimism score: 5</p>

What would happen if vaccination rates went up by a little bit, or fell by a whole lot?</p>
