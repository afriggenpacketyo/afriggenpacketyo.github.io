            <h2>Malaysian Durian Sales Soar in China Due to Demand for Naturally Ripened Fruit</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 01:31:07 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Malaysian durian exports to China are experiencing a significant surge this year, driven by Chinese consumers' increasing preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Improved logistics and a steady supply have contributed to this growth, with Malaysian suppliers projecting a 30% increase in exports. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree, which is well-received by affluent Chinese consumers who value the fruit's quality and freshness. This trend presents substantial opportunities for Malaysian durian growers to expand their market presence in China.</p>

            <p>Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce in Ukraine, President Zelensky stated that Russian attacks were ongoing in some areas. Zelensky expressed skepticism, accusing Moscow of attempting to create a false impression of a ceasefire while continuing offensive operations. He affirmed Ukraine's commitment to mirroring Russia's actions if a full and unconditional cessation of hostilities were observed, reiterating a proposal for a 30-day truce. International reactions, including from the UK, emphasized the need for genuine actions rather than symbolic gestures to achieve lasting peace.</p>

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish the Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission, marking the first step in a long-shot effort to potentially acquire parts of Illinois. This initiative stems from political divisions, with some Illinois counties seeking to separate from the Democratic-controlled Chicago area and join Republican-led Indiana. However, any boundary changes would require approval from the Illinois government and the U.S. Congress, facing opposition from Illinois' top elected officials. Similar efforts are underway in eastern Oregon, where some counties wish to join Idaho.</p>
