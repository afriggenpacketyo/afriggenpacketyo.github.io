        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia launched a large-scale air assault on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. Ukrainian officials characterized the attack as evidence that Moscow is uninterested in a truce, despite ongoing cease-fire negotiations. Ukraine claims to have shot down a majority of the missiles and drones, but the attacks have strained the country's air defenses and increased civilian casualties. The attacks occurred even as prisoner exchange negotiations continue, with both sides releasing 303 prisoners in a major swap. The ongoing violence underscores the failure of diplomatic efforts to achieve a breakthrough, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has called for increased pressure on Russia, citing the need to stop the daily killings and the silence of America. The optimism score for this article reflects the tragic nature of the events described.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Rand Paul are at odds over the spending cuts proposed in President Trump's budget bill, with Paul calling the cuts "wimpy" and Johnson defending the bill as necessary to avoid economic default. Johnson emphasized the importance of extending the debt ceiling, a key component of the bill, and argued that bipartisan support is unattainable. Paul, however, argues that the bill will explode the national debt and proposes raising the debt ceiling for only three months at a time to force more frequent discussions on the issue. The disagreement highlights divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal responsibility and the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention and potential deportation. The arrest, initially for an alleged false turn, was later dropped, but not before Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the U.S. at age four, was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The incident sparked national attention, with calls for her release and criticism of local law enforcement's collaboration with Ice. The White House's attempts to engage in ‚Äúmass deportations‚Äù during Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country.

          <p>President Trump's recent embrace of the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. Israel had previously launched numerous attacks to prevent hostile groups from gaining power and to secure its borders. However, Trump's meeting with al-Shara and the lifting of sanctions have altered the dynamics, potentially undermining Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. Some analysts suggest that Israel is now seeking ways to de-escalate and open dialogue with the Syrian regime, despite concerns about al-Shara's true intentions.

          <p>Walt Disney Co.‚Äôs live-action film ‚ÄúLilo & Stitch‚Äù grossed $183 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, making it the biggest Memorial Day weekend opener ever.

          <p>President Trump has again targeted Harvard University after a judge blocked his administration's move to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that the home countries of some of Harvard's international students are "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." He added that the administration wants to "to know who those foreign students are" and that "Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming."
