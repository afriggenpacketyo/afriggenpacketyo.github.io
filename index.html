          <p>At least two people were killed after a gunman opened fire on firefighters who were responding to a wildfire on Canfield Mountain in Idaho. The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office confirmed that first responders were taking active sniper fire, prompting a shelter-in-place order for residents as the suspect remained at large. Law enforcement officials stated they were prepared to neutralize the active shooter, who was still firing at public safety personnel during a press conference. Idaho's governor condemned the incident as a heinous assault on the state's brave firefighters.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing its efforts to combat a surge in attacks against religious facilities, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon described the attacks as a form of terrorism meant to intimidate communities, highlighting recent convictions and lengthy prison sentences for individuals who targeted churches. The Southern Poverty Law Center links the rise in threats to white nationalism and the targeting of minority groups or churches welcoming to LGBTQ communities. The DOJ is prioritizing these cases to ensure people of faith do not feel like soft targets in the United States.</p>

          <p>Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, a top Shiite cleric in Iran, has issued a fatwa, or religious decree, against former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ruling declares that any person or government endangering the global Islamic community is a "warlord" who can face severe punishment under Iranian law, including execution. This action follows a period of intense conflict where U.S. and Israeli strikes reportedly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities. Some experts have condemned the fatwa as a state-sanctioned incitement to global terrorism, signaling broader ambitions for religiously motivated violence.</p>

          <p>A significant vegetation fire, named the Mandalay fire, erupted in Riverside, California, quickly growing to over 60 acres and prompting mandatory evacuation orders for residents. The Riverside Fire Department reported that the four-alarm blaze caused heavy, drifting smoke, leading to numerous emergency calls from concerned citizens in the area. Authorities established an evacuation center at a local senior center to accommodate those forced to flee their homes. The affected zone is located north of Arlington Avenue and south of the Santa Ana River Trail, with officials urging the public to stay clear of the area.</p>

          <p>CIA Director John Ratcliffe informed U.S. lawmakers that recent American military strikes delivered a monumental setback to Iran's nuclear program, destroying its only metal conversion facility at the Isfahan site. This facility is crucial for transforming enriched uranium gas into metal, a key step for building a nuclear bomb core. While the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, confirmed severe damage but noted it was not total, Ratcliffe asserted the loss has removed Tehran's ability to build a weapon for years. The intelligence community also assesses that Iran's air defense was shattered, leaving any rebuilding efforts vulnerable to future strikes.</p>

The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center spent nearly five months rehabilitating the cub, carefully providing medical care while ensuring it did not become habituated to humans. Staff focused on pain management and nutrition before moving the animal to an outdoor enclosure to encourage natural survival behaviors. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating an avoidance of people, the cub was released by wildlife officials into a remote area of Orange County.</p>

          <p>Despite being declared extinct in 1986, the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, remains a subject of intense fascination and dedicated searching in Australia. Thousands of reported sightings, though none officially confirmed, continue to fuel the passion of enthusiasts who use trail cams and forensic techniques to find evidence of the creature's survival. The obsession is not just in the wild; a de-extinction project, backed by tech investors, aims to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. While some scientists call the project impossible, the enduring hope reflects a collective remorse for the animal's extinction and a deep connection to a lost part of Australia's natural heritage.</p>

The scrapbook, belonging to officer Karl HÃ¶cker, shows notorious figures like Josef Mengele socializing, singing, and enjoying leisure time, all while the systematic murder of 1.1 million people occurred nearby. The photos, which depict officers at parties and a vacation resort, starkly contrast with the atrocities of the camp, raising profound questions about human capacity for compartmentalization and evil. The discovery has inspired a Pulitzer-nominated play, "Here There Are Blueberries," exploring the normalcy of the perpetrators' lives amidst the horror.</p>

A notable incident involved up to 40 drones invading the airspace above Langley Air Force Base for 17 consecutive nights, forcing the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets. Despite the clear threat, officials face major hurdles in responding due to gaps in detection technology, restrictive policies for engaging targets over civilian areas, and jurisdictional complexities.

          <p>Filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, is renowned for his six-decade career creating over 70 feature films and documentaries that explore the extremes of human nature and the indifference of the natural world. Known for films like "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" and "Grizzly Man," Herzog's work often delves into themes of obsession, madness, and survival, shot in some of the planet's most remote locations. He famously pushes boundaries, once hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog continues to work, teaching aspiring filmmakers to embrace a "good criminal energy" and believing his prose and poetry will ultimately outlive his cinematic achievements.</p>

          <p>Stopping the drone swarms menacing U.S. military sites is a complex challenge due to technological limitations and legal constraints. Standard radar systems often fail to detect small, low-flying drones, and downing them over populated areas with missiles is unsafe due to potential collateral damage. Jamming drone frequencies is also problematic as it can interfere with essential civilian services like Wi-Fi and GPS. Furthermore, a tangled web of jurisdiction among agencies like the FBI, FAA, and military complicates a coordinated response. The Pentagon is now developing deployable "fly-away kits" with advanced sensors and counter-drone technology to address these significant security gaps.</p>

He then builds the film shot-by-shot, spontaneously writing and recording his philosophical narration to imbue images with deeper meaning and emotion. This method aims to transport audiences beyond mere information and into a dreamlike reality, creating memorable sequences that explore fundamental questions about existence, such as whether fish have souls.</p>

However, this rapid growth has a dark side, as recent reports reveal the exploitation of local workers hired for low-wage, psychologically damaging AI data-labeling jobs with little security. While President William Ruto champions technology to address youth unemployment, critics and former officials argue that Kenya must update its labor laws to protect its workforce. The country's future as a leading tech player may depend on balancing job creation with ensuring fair and safe working conditions.</p>

          <p>A child who fell overboard from the Disney Dream cruise ship and her father who jumped into the sea after her were both safely rescued. The incident occurred as the ship was sailing between The Bahamas and Florida, prompting an immediate "man overboard" alert. According to Disney Cruise Line and passenger accounts, the crew responded swiftly, deploying a rescue boat and recovering both guests from the water within minutes. It remains unclear how the child fell from Deck 4, which is protected by plexiglass safety barriers. The cruise line commended its crew for their prompt and effective actions, highlighting the success of their safety protocols.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), designed to help people save for a first home or retirement, can leave some individuals with less money than they invested. The product offers a 25% government bonus on savings up to Â£4,000 annually, but early withdrawals for reasons other than the intended purposes incur a penalty that results in a 6.25% loss of the saver's own capital. The Treasury Committee report called for reforms, describing the LISA as complex and potentially unsuitable for many, particularly those on benefits whose eligibility can be negatively affected by the savings.

          <p>The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, once considered a very safe aircraft, is facing scrutiny following a fatal Air India crash and a history of whistleblower allegations about production standards. Since its 2009 debut, the 787 has suffered from quality control issues, including battery fires and manufacturing defects at its South Carolina plant. Former employees, like the late John Barnett, claimed that pressure to speed up production led to compromised safety, with defective parts allegedly being installed on planes. While Boeing insists the aircraft is safe, the recent tragedy has renewed concerns about whether past production failures could pose ongoing risks to the fleet.</p>

          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a sprawling domestic policy bill championed by Donald Trump would increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

These stark figures are complicating Republican efforts to pass the bill, as internal party divisions grow over its cost and impact.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting statements from the Trump administration have created confusion about the extent of the damage and the mission's primary goals. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial intelligence reports suggested a more limited setback of only a few months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift their focus, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing on the complete destruction of nuclear facilities.

The measure had faced backlash from at least nine fellow Republicans in the House and Senate, as well as conservation and recreation advocates. The proposal's defeat is seen as a victory for public land defenders, though they remain vigilant against future threats.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis has announced he will not seek reelection, a day after voting against advancing Donald Trump's signature budget bill. Tillis stated that independent, bipartisan thinkers have become an "endangered species" in Washington. His opposition to the bill, which he argued would be "devastating" to his state due to its cuts to Medicaid funding, drew sharp criticism from Trump, who threatened to back a primary challenger. Tillis's retirement highlights the deep divisions within the Republican party and the political consequences for lawmakers who defy the former president's agenda.</p>

          <p>England's national football team received a significant boost as star forward Lauren James made an impactful return from a three-month hamstring injury. In a 7-0 victory over Jamaica, James came off the bench and provided a crucial assist within eight minutes, signaling her readiness for the upcoming Euro 2025 tournament. The 23-year-old Chelsea player, who was a breakout star at the last World Cup, is considered a key component of the Lionesses' attack as they look to defend their European title. While her fitness for a full 90-minute match is still being built, her versatility and game-changing talent provide a major tactical advantage for manager Sarina Wiegman.</p>
