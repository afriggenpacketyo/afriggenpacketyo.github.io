          <p>Former President Trump called on Iran to negotiate a nuclear deal following Israeli airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program and military commanders. Trump stated that the U.S. possesses superior military equipment and that Israel has a substantial arsenal, urging Iran to act before it's too late. The strikes, which Iranian media reported hit Tehran and Natanz, resulted in the death of IRGC commander Hossein Salam and other top officials, according to Israel's Defense Ministry. Trump emphasized that circumstances would worsen without a deal, urging Iran to save what remains of the Iranian Empire. Optimism remains low due to the escalating tensions and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old girl in Arkansas died after being attacked by a pack of dogs she was caring for at a makeshift animal rescue. The Saline County Sheriff's Office reported that the girl was found fatally attacked within a fenced area on the property, where about 30 dogs were housed. Neighbors had previously complained about the dogs' behavior, suggesting the tragedy could have been prevented. Authorities euthanized 14 of the dogs involved, and an investigation into the incident is ongoing.

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, prompting Iran to retaliate with a drone attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the operation, named "Operation Rising Lion," aimed to eliminate the Iranian threat to Israel's survival. IDF spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said that Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iran against targeting U.S. interests or personnel. The attacks have heightened tensions in the region and cast doubt on ongoing U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>Seven men in Rochdale, England, have been convicted of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over a five-year period. The girls, groomed from the age of 13, were treated as "sex slaves" by the gang, who plied them with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. The men, some of whom worked on the town's market, were found guilty of various sexual offenses against the victims. Police acknowledged that more should have been done at the time to protect the girls, and that improvements have since been made in how such investigations are managed. The convictions are part of an ongoing investigation into historical child sexual exploitation in the town.</p>

          <p>One of the "black boxes," containing flight data and cockpit voice recordings, has been recovered from the wreckage of Air India flight 171 in Ahmedabad, India. The passenger jet crashed into buildings shortly after takeoff, killing all but one of the 242 people on board and dozens on the ground. India's aviation regulator has ordered Air India to conduct additional safety inspections on its Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 aircraft. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that it would be premature to ground 787 aircraft in the U.S. before examining the evidence. The tragedy is India's worst aviation disaster in over 25 years, prompting assistance from U.S. and British authorities.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's attack on Iran, Hezbollah, a major Iran-backed militia group based in Lebanon, issued a statement condemning the attack but did not offer to join in retaliation. Analysts suggest this restraint could be due to Hezbollah's losses during a recent war with Israel, or a prioritization of internal restructuring, including local arms production. Despite a ceasefire, Israel has frequently attacked sites connected with Hezbollah, raising questions about the group's strength and its role as Iran's front line of external defense. Lebanon's government has also stepped up efforts to contain Hezbollah, dismantling military positions and arms depots.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a downturn, and oil prices surged following Israel's military strike on Iran. S&P 500 futures contracts fell, and U.S. benchmark crude oil prices jumped significantly. Markets in Asia and Europe also saw declines in overnight trading. Analysts suggest that the escalation could impact the global economy through higher oil prices, with concerns about Iran potentially blocking the Strait of Hormuz. While Iranian crude exports are already restricted, a sustained increase in energy prices could hinder the U.S.'s progress in lowering inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling elections in the U.S. The judge sided with Democratic state attorneys general who argued the order was unconstitutional. Trump's order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general argued that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power and sought to amend election law by fiat. The White House defended the order as promoting free, fair, and honest elections.</p>

Boatwright believes this efficiency not only helps keep restaurants staffed but also ensures the company has the best talent available. This hiring speed could help Chipotle open more than 300 locations this year, which is nearly one every 24 hours.

          <p>This article analyzes the rise of the tech right and its support for Donald Trump, and why that support has waned. While the tech industry has generally leaned liberal, a notable tech right has emerged in recent years. The shift is attributed to factors like the "Great Awokening," changes in the macroeconomic environment, and deliberate efforts by liberals to target the tech scene. Despite some hopes for deregulation and tax cuts under Trump, the tech right's priorities were largely unmet, leading to a failed bet. The author suggests Democrats should consider how to win back voters from Trump's fracturing coalition.</p>

Trump criticized the judges and Leonard Leo, a key figure in the conservative legal movement, for not supporting his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This rift highlights a growing divide between the MAGA movement and the Federalist Society, as judges appointed with the Federalist Society's input have often ruled against Trump's demands when they conflict with legal principles. This shift may influence Trump's judicial appointments going forward, potentially leading to the selection of more MAGA-aligned candidates.</p>

          <p>A New York mayoral debate featured sharp exchanges between candidates, particularly between Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo criticized Mamdani's inexperience, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo's controversies as governor, including sexual harassment allegations. The debate also touched on immigration policy, with candidates discussing how they would handle federal immigration enforcement. Cuomo faced criticism for his use of the term "illegal immigrants" and for avoiding accountability for his time in office. Mamdani was questioned about support for Jewish New Yorkers, while Cuomo was criticized for not visiting a mosque during his tenure as governor.</p>

The appeals court will hold a hearing on the matter. The Trump administration invoked a law that allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service during a "rebellion," but California argued that the protests did not meet that threshold.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and in breach of human rights law. The court found that while the legislation does interfere with some human rights, the government was entitled to consider the revenue raised for public services outweighed the adverse effects on some families. The government welcomed the judgment, stating that the policy would raise £1.8 billion a year to support pupils in state schools. The policy, introduced on January 1, has faced opposition from families with children with special educational needs and disabilities, those attending same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools.</p>

          <p>A Bulgarian influencer, Zornitsa Gyutsova, is facing backlash for her misogynistic online content that incites violence against women. Gyutsova suggests that women prefer men who are violent and that men should control their partners physically if necessary. Despite complaints filed with the prosecutor's office and the Commission against Discrimination, no charges have been brought against Gyutsova due to the lack of a specific crime for gender discrimination in Bulgaria's criminal code. The influencer's TikTok and Instagram profiles were briefly deactivated but later reactivated. Experts believe that a lack of consequences for abusers and societal indifference contribute to the problem.</p>

          <p>Meta AI users may be unaware that their search prompts and results are being posted on a public feed. This practice raises privacy concerns, as some posts can be traced back to social media accounts through usernames and profile pictures. Experts warn of a potential "user experience and security problem," as people may inadvertently share sensitive information. Examples include users posting test questions seeking answers and generating images of scantily-clad characters. The lack of clear user awareness about the public nature of these searches raises ethical questions about data privacy and user consent.</p>
