          <h2>EPA to Reconsider Limits on Certain Forever Chemicals in Drinking Water</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 20:32:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EPA plans to weaken limits on some PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in drinking water finalized last year, while maintaining standards for PFOA and PFOS. The move follows lawsuits from water utilities arguing the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and didn't properly support limits on newer types of PFAS. While limits on some PFAS will be reconsidered, the EPA will keep the standards for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion, giving utilities until 2031 to comply. Health advocates criticize the move, while utilities argue treatment systems are expensive, potentially raising customer bills.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. Trump praised al-Sharaa and urged him to normalize ties with Israel and combat terrorism. The meeting, joined by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, signals a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, aiming to curb Iranian influence. Some senators have expressed caution, urging proper congressional channels to be followed before easing sanctions, while activist Mouaz Moustafa claims al-Sharaa is a changed man focused on rebuilding Syria.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the decision by the California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, intended to alleviate financial distress after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The increase, lower than the initially proposed 21.8%, will take effect on June 1, pending another hearing. State Farm faced criticism from fire survivors over payment delays, while Lara assured residents he considered all options and is focused on ensuring State Farm pays claims fully and fairly. The company has also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's approach to South Africa has been significantly influenced by President Trump's focus on white Afrikaner farmers, leading to policy changes such as prioritizing their resettlement in the U.S. and halting aid to South Africa. This shift is driven by meetings with Afrikaner activists, a break over Israel's war in Gaza, and a focus on eradicating diversity programs. The administration's actions have strained relations between the two countries, with the expulsion of South Africaâ€™s ambassador and the implementation of policies perceived as favoring white victimhood. Critics argue that Trump's views are based on misinformation and are exacerbating racial tensions in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Justin Baldoni's legal team claims Blake Lively threatened Taylor Swift, implying the release of personal text messages if Swift didn't publicly support Lively in her legal dispute with Baldoni. Lively's lawyer denies these claims as false and abusive, with Lively's legal team filing a motion to strike the accusations. The legal battle stems from Lively's accusation of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the filming of "It Ends With Us," which Baldoni denies, counter-suing Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, for civil extortion and defamation. Both sides are preparing for a trial scheduled in March 2026.</p>

          <p>Residents in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, claim a jet fuel leak from a Sunoco Pipeline went undetected for months, poisoning their drinking water. Despite initial complaints, Sunoco Pipeline allegedly dismissed concerns until a state investigation revealed the leak, impacting at least 38 wells. Residents rely on wells drawing from underground aquifers for their water. Sunoco's partner company, Energy Transfer, stated they installed water filtration systems and are committed to cleanup, but didn't address the delay in finding the leak. A resident is suing Sunoco Pipeline and plans to move from the neighborhood due to safety concerns.</p>

The CDC credited President Trump for adding resources to address the issue, but the announcement coincided with proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. Experts worry the cuts could undermine the progress made, despite the fact that drug fatalities remain high, with 80,391 deaths in 2024.

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction, escalating a clash between the Trump administration and local authorities over immigration enforcement. Dugan is accused of helping a man evade ICE agents by escorting him out of her courtroom through a back door. The judge filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing she is entitled to judicial immunity. The state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, pending the outcome of the case.</p>

          <p>Paramilitary fighters in Sudan appear to have opened a new phase in the civil war with unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan, leading to power blackouts and water shortages. These attacks signal the RSF's determination to continue fighting despite territorial losses and showcase the growing use of advanced drone warfare in Africa. The UN calls the situation the world's worst humanitarian crisis, as the RSF seeks to demonstrate its strength and disrupt the army's supply lines. The escalating drone warfare has also highlighted the role of foreign actors in the conflict, with accusations of the UAE and Iran supplying weapons to the warring factions.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia, some say the city hasn't done enough to remember the victims and rectify the "unconscionable" act. On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a rowhome in Cobbs Creek, killing 11 people, including five children. The decision to bomb the home came after years of escalating conflict between MOVE, a Black liberation group, and Cobbs Creek neighbors. While the city has installed a historical marker, some argue it doesn't appropriately capture the trauma, pain, and grief.</p>

          <p>Despite India's objections, the IMF approved a $1 billion bailout to Pakistan, citing Islamabad's strong program implementation and the need to build economic resilience. India raised concerns about the efficacy of bailouts given Pakistan's track record and the potential for funds to be used for cross-border terrorism. As one of 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence is limited, with voting rights based on economic size and contributions. Experts suggest India should address its grievances through the United Nations FATF, which combats terror finance.</p>

          <p>A luxury superyacht that sank off the coast of Sicily, killing tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and six others, was toppled by "extreme wind" and could not recover, according to an interim report. Winds of over 80mph "violently" hit the vessel, causing it to flood within seconds, resulting in the deaths of seven people. Investigators say the yacht was knocked to a 90-degree angle within 15 seconds, causing people, furniture and loose items to fall across the deck. The MAIB's chief inspector of marine accidents said the situation was "irrecoverable" once the yacht tilted beyond 70 degrees.</p>

The virus, first detected in the UK in 2020, has been linked to declines in blackbird populations in Greater London. Scientists are monitoring its spread and calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens to gather more data. Longer summers, hotter temperatures, and heavy rainfall are creating conditions for mosquitoes to move into previously inhospitable areas.</p>

The revelation could help explain why Co-op has started to recover more quickly than fellow retailer M&S, which had its systems more comprehensively compromised. The gang claimed to have breached Co-op's computer systems long before they were discovered and were planning to infect the company with ransomware but were detected. Co-op seems to have opted for self-imposed immediate-term disruption as a means of avoiding criminal-imposed, longer-term disruption.</p>
