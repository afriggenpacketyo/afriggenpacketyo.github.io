          <p>OnePay, the fintech company majority-owned by retail giant Walmart, is set to integrate cryptocurrency services into its mobile banking application later this year. According to sources, the platform will initially allow customers to trade and hold Bitcoin and Ether, facilitated by a partnership with the startup Zerohash. This strategic move aligns OnePay with other major financial apps like PayPal and Cash App, which already offer crypto features. The expansion is part of OnePay's broader goal to become a comprehensive financial "super app" for American consumers, leveraging Walmart's vast customer base for distribution.</p>

          <p>In the investigation into the murder of Kenneth Fandrich in Oregon, a crucial piece of evidence—a maroon minivan believed to be the primary crime scene—was mistakenly destroyed before police could secure it. Detectives traced the vehicle, allegedly used by suspect Dr. Steven Milner, to a scrapyard, only to discover it had been crushed just a week prior. Fandrich was found dead in a parking garage at an Intel campus, and police believe he was killed inside the minivan. The loss of the vehicle represents a significant setback for prosecutors, who hoped it contained vital forensic evidence linking Milner to the crime.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a stark ultimatum to Hamas, demanding the group accept a U.S.-brokered peace plan by Sunday evening or face severe consequences. The proposal, unveiled with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. While mediators are urging Hamas to agree, internal divisions within the group and concerns over relinquishing their primary bargaining chip—the hostages—have created significant obstacles. Trump warned on his social media platform that failure to comply would result in unprecedented action against the militant group.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon, who is married to Democratic Representative Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, has recused himself from a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the Oregon National Guard. The state of Oregon had sued President Trump and other officials over the decision to federalize troops to address protests in Portland. The administration's lawyers suggested recusal was necessary due to Rep. Bonamici's public and staunch opposition to the deployment, arguing that the judge's impartiality could be reasonably questioned. Judge Simon, an Obama appointee, subsequently stepped aside from presiding over the case.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy has brought significant disruption to Northern Ireland, with high winds and heavy rain forcing hundreds of schools to close early and leading to the cancellation of numerous events. The Met Office issued amber and yellow weather warnings, with wind gusts expected to reach up to 80 mph in coastal areas. The Education Authority advised schools in several counties to shut down at midday as a safety precaution.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging a Hawaii law that restricts individuals with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns onto private property open to the public without explicit owner permission. This case is the latest Second Amendment dispute to reach the high court following its landmark 2022 decision in the *Bruen* case, which expanded gun rights. The Hawaii law, enacted in 2023, was challenged by gun owners who argue it effectively nullifies the right to carry in public. The Trump administration supported the challenge, claiming the restriction amounts to a near-total ban on public carry.</p>

          <p>After being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over 100 days, journalist Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador. Guevara, a longtime Atlanta-area journalist who fled El Salvador in 2004, was arrested on minor charges that were later dismissed while he was livestreaming a protest. Press freedom organizations like the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned his prolonged detention and deportation, arguing it represents a threat to journalistic rights in the U.S. His family and advocates stated that the government's actions create a chilling effect on media freedoms, particularly for reporting on law enforcement activities.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's record £116m signing, Florian Wirtz, has had a difficult start to his Premier League career, failing to score or provide an assist in his first nine appearances. Tactical analysis suggests that manager Arne Slot's new system requires Wirtz to play a deeper, more physically demanding role than he was accustomed to at Bayer Leverkusen. This shift has limited his opportunities in attacking positions, as he is often tasked with dropping deep to aid in build-up play. While his work rate has been high, adapting to the league's intensity and finding a better balance within the team's new structure will be key to unlocking his potential.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding designated for two major Chicago transit system improvements, citing the ongoing government shutdown. The Department of Transportation stated the freeze on the Red Line Extension and Red and Purple Modernization projects is necessary for a review to ensure they do not involve "unconstitutional" race or gender-based contracting practices. This action follows similar funding freezes for projects in New York and is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting infrastructure in Democrat-led cities and states.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A hypothetical $30,000 HELOC with a 10-year repayment term now costs approximately $362 per month, down from around $375 at the end of 2024. The article suggests that with further rate cuts anticipated from the Federal Reserve later in the year, borrowing costs for HELOCs could decrease even more.

          <p>Apple has removed ICEBlock and other similar applications from its App Store that allowed users to report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The decision came after Attorney General Pam Bondi urged the company to take action, citing safety risks to law enforcement officers. The move is controversial, with critics arguing the apps are a tool for immigrant communities to ensure safety, while supporters claim they could be used to target agents. Apple stated it made the decision based on information from law enforcement regarding the safety risks associated with the apps.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee voiced concerns about lowering interest rates too hastily, citing simultaneous risks to both inflation and employment. He noted that the recent uptick in inflation, combined with deteriorating payroll numbers, has placed the central bank in a difficult position where both sides of its dual mandate are under pressure. While the Federal Open Market Committee recently cut its benchmark rate, Goolsbee indicated he is wary of front-loading further cuts. Despite his caution, he believes the underlying economy is stable enough to support a gradual reduction in rates over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have revealed that one of the two victims killed in the terrorist attack outside a synagogue may have died from a police officer's gunshot. Chief Constable Stephen Watson stated that a pathologist's provisional findings indicated a wound consistent with a gunshot injury on one of the deceased. As the suspect was not believed to have a firearm, the injury is thought to be an unintended consequence of police action to neutralize the threat. A third victim, who is hospitalized, also sustained a non-life-threatening gunshot wound during the incident.</p>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, centralized price changes. This technology enables retailers to update prices in minutes, which can improve efficiency and help reduce food waste by lowering prices on perishable items. However, some lawmakers and consumer advocates have raised concerns that these digital tags could pave the way for "dynamic pricing," where costs for essential goods could fluctuate based on demand, time of day, or other factors. Retailers currently deny using such surge pricing tactics.</p>

Following the news, stocks for Chinese EV makers like BYD, Nio, and XPeng fell, with BYD also reporting its first monthly shipment decline since early 2024. Despite Tesla's strong performance, its own stock dipped amid investor concerns about whether the sales surge was driven by sustainable demand or a rush for expiring U.S. tax credits.
