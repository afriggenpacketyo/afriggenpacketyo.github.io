          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly condemned Republicans who are advocating for the full release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling the entire matter a "hoax" orchestrated by Democrats. He asserted, without evidence, that the controversy is a scam and disavowed supporters who focus on it, urging them to concentrate on his administration's successes instead. When questioned by reporters, Trump doubled down on his claims but did not provide any evidence, leading to pushback from some GOP members who continue to seek transparency on the issue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, just hours after reportedly discussing the possibility with Republican lawmakers. Trump has persistently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates, recently calling him a "knucklehead." The discussions have created market uncertainty, as removing a Fed chair would be an unprecedented move that could undermine the central bank's independence from political influence. Allies have also criticized Powell over renovation costs for Fed buildings, which some analysts see as building a case for removal "for cause." (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has acknowledged that China is making significant progress in curbing the flow of fentanyl into the United States, a notable shift from his previous rhetoric. This positive assessment comes as high-level trade negotiations between the two countries are ongoing. Previously, Trump had used the fentanyl issue as a justification for imposing and increasing tariffs on Chinese imports, declaring that the penalties would remain until the drug trafficking was seriously limited. His current comments suggest a potential de-escalation of tensions on this specific front.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's strategy of dismissing the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as a "hoax" represents a significant political gamble that could alienate his own supporters. By attacking "stupid" and "foolish" Republicans who believe in potential conspiracies, he is contradicting his typical anti-establishment narrative and positioning himself as a defender of the status quo. This approach risks undermining the perception of authenticity that has been central to his political appeal, creating a rare point of division between him and his loyal base.</p>

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado who died this week at age 49, found profound joy and a new way of living after receiving a terminal ovarian cancer diagnosis two years ago. Known for their earnest and empathetic verse on themes of love, kindness, and social justice, Gibson chose to accept their illness rather than "battle" it. This acceptance allowed them to overcome lifelong anxiety and embrace the brevity of life, a perspective that infused their later work. Their final words, shared by loved ones, were "I fucking loved my life," reflecting a transformation from fear to profound appreciation.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced new restrictions on tariff-free steel imports to protect its domestic industry from the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada will tighten its tariff rate quotas on steel from countries without free trade agreements and impose an additional tariff on steel containing materials from China. The move aims to reduce Canada's dependency on the U.S. market and support domestic production by prioritizing Canadian steel for major government projects, following a significant drop in production since the U.S. levies were imposed.

          <p>A major UK government data breach that occurred in February 2022 accidentally exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation to flee the Taliban. The leak, originating from UK Special Forces headquarters, was kept secret by a super-injunction until recently. In response, the government covertly established a new resettlement route, bringing approximately 4,500 individuals and their families to the UK. However, it remains unknown how many people on the leaked list are still in Afghanistan, and an independent review concluded the leak was unlikely to be the sole cause of any reprisal attacks.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to incorporate the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its policies as it negotiates with the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions in frozen federal grants. The funding was withheld over allegations the university failed to protect Jewish students during campus protests. Critics argue the IHRA definition is controversial because it can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel by conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism. The move is seen by some as a capitulation that sacrifices academic freedom to resolve the funding dispute.</p>

The suspended MPs, including Rachael Maskell, stated they were representing their constituents' interests and could not support measures that would make disabled people poorer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in U.S. inflation is raising concerns that interest rates on credit cards could remain high or climb further. Because most credit card APRs are tied to the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, which the Fed keeps high to combat inflation, consumers carrying debt are directly affected. With the average credit card rate already over 21%, any further tightening of monetary policy to control rising prices would translate into higher interest costs for cardholders. Financial experts advise consumers with balances to proactively seek solutions like balance transfers or personal loans to mitigate the impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill aims to close loopholes by capping contributions, prohibiting donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and delaying fundraising until a president leaves office.
