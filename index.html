          <p>The Senate Republicans passed a framework for a bill promoting President Trump's agenda, which included raising the debt ceiling and making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The framework passed mostly along party lines, with some Republicans expressing reservations about the methods used to achieve these goals. The budget would address border funding and extend the tax cuts passed in 2017. The Senate's vote-a-rama allowed senators to introduce numerous amendments, none of which were adopted, but highlighted divisions on issues like minimum wage and tariffs.</p>

          <p>Sierra Leone declared a public health emergency over the rampant abuse of kush, a synthetic drug, but intervention efforts have largely overlooked women. Many women, facing social factors like living conditions and stigma, have not benefited from the measures. The drug's evolving composition, low cost, and widespread availability make it difficult to combat, and its use is associated with gender-based violence and economic discrimination. While officials claim kush is becoming scarcer, critics argue that programs are underfunded and inadequate, with few women accessing the available rehab programs.</p>

          <p>The potential ban on TikTok in the US has been delayed for a second time as China has reportedly stalled on a deal to sell its US operations due to tariff disagreements. President Trump extended the deadline by 75 days, citing the need for more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed. This delay is linked to Trump's increased tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing. The deal to have TikTok's US arm run by a new US-based company is facing hurdles, as Chinese government approval remains an issue.</p>

          <p>President Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs marks a significant shift in US trade policy, ending an era of globalization. Trump has advocated for tariffs for decades, believing they will revitalize the US economy and generate revenue. However, many economists and businesses view the plan as flawed and risky, predicting negative consequences for consumers and the economy. Trump's administration argues that tariffs will correct unfair trade imbalances and bring jobs back to America, despite concerns about increased costs for US households.</p>

          <p>Across-the-board 10% tariffs on nearly all imports went into effect amid continued economic fallout from President Trump's plan. More severe tariffs on imports from several dozen countries are slated to follow. Wall Street has been roiling ever since Trump's announcement, with the trading session marking the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. Trump has dismissed concerns about the short-term pain economists expect to be passed on to American consumers.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs and Nike's Iconic Air Jordans</h2>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are expected to impact the price of Nike's iconic Air Jordan 1s, as most of Nike's shoes are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by the tariffs. Nike's shares fell following the tariff announcement, raising concerns about the company's supply chain. Analysts predict that Nike may have to raise prices to offset the increased costs, although large price increases could reduce demand. Nike may also downgrade the level of tech in the shoe or refresh the design cycle less frequently to keep retail prices low.</p>

It appears “Doge” could be eyeing cuts to the agency, which sends US volunteers around the world to work in local communities on health, education and environmental initiatives. Since Donald Trump was inaugurated, Musk and his allies in Doge have been steadily working to slash budgets and layoff workers in federal agencies.</p>
