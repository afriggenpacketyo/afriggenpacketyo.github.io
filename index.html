          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on ABC drew 6.26 million viewers despite preemptions by 23% of U.S. TV households.  His monologue, exceeding 28 minutes, addressed his suspension following controversial comments about Charlie Kirk's death.  The show also garnered over 26 million views across YouTube and social media, achieving its highest rating among adults aged 18 to 49 in over a decade.  The preemptions stemmed from concerns raised by Nexstar and Sinclair about potential license repercussions.</p>

Obama highlighted that these claims have been repeatedly disproven and could harm pregnant women who might avoid necessary pain relief.  He contrasted Trump's approach with a progressive vision for the future, emphasizing the dangers of populist rhetoric and the erosion of public trust in science. The comments were made during an interview at the O2 Arena in London.</p>
