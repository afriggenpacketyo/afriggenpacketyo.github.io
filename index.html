          <p>Pro-democracy activist Ted Hui, who fled Hong Kong in 2020 amid criminal charges related to the 2019 protests, has been granted asylum in Australia. Hui confirmed the decision on social media, expressing gratitude while also highlighting the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return home. He is one of several activists targeted by Hong Kong police with million-dollar bounties in 2023. Hui also used the announcement to urge the Australian government to advocate for other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>The British horse racing industry has announced an unprecedented strike for September 10th, canceling four scheduled race meetings to protest a proposed government tax hike. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) is campaigning against a plan to increase the remote gambling tax on racing from 15% to 21%. The BHA warns this change would be catastrophic, projecting a £330 million loss in revenue and the endangerment of over 2,700 jobs in the first year alone. This marks the first time the sport has voluntarily stopped races in its modern history over a government proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasing scrutiny on businesses that avoid social insurance contributions, a move expected to boost the hiring of retirees who are exempt from these payments. This trend, highlighted by McDonald's recruitment of older workers, has sparked social media debate, with some fearing it will reduce job opportunities for recent graduates. A new Supreme People's Court interpretation, effective next month, will invalidate agreements to forgo social insurance, adding legal pressure on companies. This policy aims to address the country's pension crisis by ensuring stricter collection of social security funds.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to classify Palestine Action as a terrorist group, stating it is more than a "regular protest group." Cooper cited incidents of alleged violent disorder and aggravated burglary, noting the Crown Prosecution Service assessed these charges as having a "terrorism connection." Her comments follow the announcement that 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for supporting the group, bringing the total arrests to over 700 since the ban. The proscription was enacted after activists caused an estimated £7 million in damage to jets at an RAF base.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel, 76, is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and auctioning his personal collection of over 75 bikes. This decision follows his recent diagnosis with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his balance, vision, and hearing. The condition, which involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, has also led him to cancel all tour dates for 2025 and into 2026. Joel opened the shop in 2010 to showcase his collection and support the local Oyster Bay community.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's national rugby team, the All Blacks, defeated Argentina 41-24 in their Rugby Championship opener, a victory that propelled them back to the top of the world rankings for the first time in four years. Despite a strong start that saw them lead 31-10 at halftime, the All Blacks had to withstand a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas. Late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho secured the win in Cordoba. The victory displaces South Africa from the number one spot after their loss to Australia.</p>

          <p>West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio are sending hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C., escalating a federal intervention initiated by President Trump's executive order. The order, which federalized local police and activated D.C. Guard members, aims to address crime and homelessness, though city officials note that violent crime is lower than during Trump's first term. The deployment has been met with protests from residents concerned about a "fascist takeover" and military occupation. This move signals the administration's push for tighter control over the nation's capital, bypassing local governance.</p>

The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one person with a strong asylum case. The continued crossings, with over 50,000 arriving since July 2024, have put pressure on the Labour government to deliver results. Concerns are also rising about smugglers using larger "mega dinghies" capable of carrying over 100 people, increasing the danger of the journey.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett explores how her appreciation for Renaissance and classical art evolved from youthful indifference to profound connection through life experience. She recounts how trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood allowed her to see the emotional depth in works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Raphael, which previously left her cold. The author contrasts her former cynicism with a newfound willingness to be moved by art, connecting it to a broader capacity for empathy. The essay suggests that understanding such art is less about academic knowledge and more about lived emotional complexity.</p>
