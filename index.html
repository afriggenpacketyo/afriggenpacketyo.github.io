          <h2>European Central Bank Pauses Interest Rate Cuts Amid Trade Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 10:29:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold interest rates steady, ending a series of four consecutive cuts this year. Policymakers cited significant uncertainty, particularly from potential U.S. tariffs on EU goods, as a primary reason for the pause. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that while the economy showed some resilience, risks to growth are tilted to the downside due to trade tensions. The bank remains in a "wait and watch" mode, keeping options open for future rate adjustments depending on geopolitical and economic developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines shares fell by approximately 10% after the company significantly lowered its 2025 profit forecast and reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street estimates. The airline cited weaker domestic travel demand and increased summer discounting as key factors, though CEO Bob Jordan noted a recent positive inflection in demand. The carrier is undergoing a business model overhaul, including changes to its baggage and seating policies, to improve its financial performance amid industry-wide challenges.

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has found two militia leaders from the Central African Republic guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The convicted individuals, a former football official and a militiaman known as "Rambo," were responsible for leading attacks against Muslim civilians between 2013 and 2014. This conviction marks a significant step in holding individuals accountable for atrocities committed during the country's civil conflict. The judgment represents a key moment for international justice in the region.</p>

          <p>New York Jets starting quarterback Justin Fields was carted off the field during a training camp practice due to an apparent lower leg injury. Fields, who signed a significant contract in the offseason to lead the team, had his right cleat removed while on the cart. The incident raises concerns about the team's leadership on the field, with veteran Tyrod Taylor positioned as the likely replacement if Fields misses significant time. This represents a major setback for the Jets as they begin their preseason preparations.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank's shares gained over 9% after the company reported second-quarter net profit that significantly beat analyst forecasts, putting it on track to meet its full-year targets. The strong performance was achieved despite mixed results in its investment banking division and headwinds from a stronger euro. While revenue from fixed income and currencies was strong, the origination and advisory unit saw a decline due to market uncertainty. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in its momentum and cost discipline moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant military escalation has occurred on the border between Thailand and Cambodia, with forces from both nations exchanging artillery, rocket, and small arms fire. Thailand also conducted airstrikes on what it described as military targets in Cambodia. The conflict, which has reportedly resulted in at least 12 deaths in Thailand, most of them civilians, was allegedly triggered by a mine explosion that injured Thai soldiers. Both countries have offered conflicting accounts of who initiated the hostilities, and Cambodia has requested an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has confirmed the launch of a new political party in collaboration with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. In a joint statement, they called for a "real, democratic alternative" to the current political system, rooted in community action. The new party is expected to adopt policies to the left of Labour, including wealth taxes, nationalization of key industries, and an end to arms sales to Israel. The move could potentially split the left-wing vote in future elections, posing a challenge to the Labour Party.</p>

Other orders aim to remove regulations to spur AI innovation and establish a program to promote the export of U.S. AI technology, with the overall goal of making the country an "AI export powerhouse."</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified more documents related to the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Gabbard claimed the materials show that Obama administration officials "manufactured" false intelligence to undermine Donald Trump's candidacy. However, Democrats and some former intelligence officials dispute this, expressing grave concerns that the release of the partisan report, which discusses sensitive sources, could endanger national security. The move has intensified political divisions over the origins and conclusions of the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission is conducting an "intensive revision" of the electoral rolls in the state of Bihar, requiring the re-verification of nearly 80 million voters ahead of state elections.

She stated that while Europe welcomes fair competition, issues like Chinese industrial overcapacity, market access barriers, and export controls on rare earths must be addressed. Without progress, she warned, the EU may find it difficult to maintain its current level of market openness. Chinese President Xi Jinping, in turn, called for deeper cooperation and trust amid global instability.</p>

The vote has deepened political divisions on the island, with China accusing the ruling DPP of "political manipulation."

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that China is not doing all it could to stop the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals, using its cooperation as a form of political leverage over the United States. While China has taken steps to regulate fentanyl, it has allowed criminal networks to shift to exporting the raw ingredients used by Mexican cartels. Beijing's level of enforcement often fluctuates with the state of U.S.-China relations, indicating that the fentanyl crisis, which causes tens of thousands of American deaths, is treated as a bargaining chip rather than a shared global problem to be solved.</p>
