          <p>Ukraine's security agency, the SBU, announced it located and killed the Russian agents responsible for assassinating a senior SBU colonel in Kyiv. The daylight attack was caught on camera, and the victim, Ivan Voronych, was reportedly involved in covert operations against Russian forces. Following the assassination, the SBU tracked the suspects to the Kyiv region, where they were killed after resisting arrest. The article notes this event is part of a larger pattern of targeted killings by both sides since Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss a new strategy for arming Ukraine. The plan involves the U.S. selling weapons to European NATO allies, who would then transfer them to Ukraine, expediting delivery. This comes as the administration considers sending more Patriot missiles and faces congressional pressure to pass legislation imposing heavy sanctions on Russia and its economic partners. The proposal aims to provide President Trump with flexible tariff powers to penalize countries supporting Russia's war effort. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square celebrated a historic milestone with the 5,000th episode of its "Music & the Spoken Word" program. The performance took place in Salt Lake City, Utah, before an audience of over 11,500 people. Originating in 1929, the program is the longest-running consecutive broadcast of its kind, having persisted through major historical events like the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic. The choir, once called "America's Choir" by Ronald Reagan, is seen by many as a source of comfort and unity.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two churchgoers and the suspect after a state trooper was shot and wounded. The event began when the trooper conducted a traffic stop, was shot by the suspect, who then carjacked a vehicle and fled to Richmond Road Baptist Church. At the church, the gunman killed two women, identified as Beverly Gum, 72, and Christina Combs, 32, and wounded two other men. The suspect, who may have had a connection to the church victims, was ultimately shot and killed by Lexington police.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some global conservative figures, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new opposition leader, Peter Magyar, has emerged from Orban's own former circle, capitalizing on public discontent over corruption and the declining state of public services. While Orban has long maintained power by identifying voter fears and consolidating control, Magyar's center-right Tisza party is gaining traction, with some polls showing it ahead of Orban's Fidesz party. The upcoming 2026 election is now seen as a critical battle for Hungary's future direction.</p>

Key information about the shooter, who was spotted with a rangefinder 25 minutes before the attack, was not effectively relayed to Trump's security detail.

Additionally, investors who bought properties at lower prices are now cashing out amid cooling buyer demand due to higher interest rates. While this gives buyers more options, sellers are adjusting by offering concessions or reducing prices to remain competitive in the shifting market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the first-ever title of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup with a stunning 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey. Cole Palmer was the star of the match, scoring two nearly identical goals in the first half with clinical, curling shots. Palmer then provided a perfectly weighted assist for João Pedro, who calmly chipped the goalkeeper to make it 3-0 before halftime. PSG, the reigning European champions, were unable to overcome the deficit, and their frustration showed late in the game with a red card for João Neves.</p>

In a televised address, Ramaphosa announced that Mchunu was placed on a "leave of absence" and that a judicial commission would be established to investigate the claims. The allegations, first made public by a provincial police boss, include interference in investigations into political killings and receiving financial support from a corrupt businessman. Mchunu, an influential figure in the ruling ANC party, has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to cooperate with the inquiry.</p>

          <p>In an address, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that despite widespread personal and political criticism of Donald Trump, his presidency could be constructive for investments. Cramer posits that a rally is being driven by individual investors, who are less concerned with traditional orthodoxy and more focused on a pro-business environment. He argues that deflationary forces from artificial intelligence will offset inflation from tariffs, and that a deregulatory environment at the agency level is fostering deal-making and higher corporate profits. Cramer concludes that even those who dislike Trump may see their stock portfolios grow during his term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brief but powerful thunderstorms swept through the Memphis, Tennessee, area on Sunday, causing significant damage and flash flooding. In Southaven, Mississippi, strong winds estimated around 60 mph knocked down trees and lights and appeared to have overturned a tractor-trailer. In East Memphis, heavy rainfall led to deep standing water on major roads like Poplar Avenue, with radar estimating one to two inches of rain fell in a short period. The storms were described by meteorologists as typical but briefly strong summer weather events that caused localized disruption and damage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Critics, including commentator Laura Loomer and Elon Musk, have accused Bondi of withholding information after a Justice Department memo stated there was "no incriminating client list." In a social media post, Trump urged his base to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein matter. The situation has highlighted a perceived division between the Justice Department and the FBI over the handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots with a raw, improvisatory, and sometimes messy feel. The album follows a period of personal tumult for the artist and features a cooled-out, atmospheric sound with collaborators like Mk.gee. Unlike his more polished pop hits, "Swag" presents a more intimate and unvarnished side of Bieber, with tracks that feel like voice memos and lyrics that frankly address his life and marriage. The review describes the album as shaggy, disarming, and often beautiful, reflecting a more instinctual and authentic musical direction.</p>

The ongoing siege and shelling have created a "death trap" for civilians, who are facing starvation and a lack of medical supplies.

          <p>To be in the top 10% of American households by wealth, a net worth of at least $2 million was required, according to the Federal Reserve’s 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances. This figure is significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900, which represents the midpoint of all American families. The analysis notes that due to stock market gains and inflation since 2022, the current threshold to enter the top 10% is likely closer to $2.2 million. Reaching this level of affluence typically requires a lifetime of high earnings, diligent saving, and successful investments. (not investment advice)</p>
