          <h2>UK Rental Costs Have Increased Significantly Over Three Years, Analysis Shows</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from property portal Zoopla indicates that the monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by an average of £221 over the last three years, an increase of 21%. This sharp rise is attributed to high demand from tenants coupled with a failure of rental property supply to keep pace. The article highlights the immense pressure on renters, with some being forced to turn down job opportunities or move due to unaffordable housing costs. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in major cities, the financial strain remains a significant issue for many individuals and families across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently circulated close-up images of China's fifth-generation J-35 fighter jet suggest it has entered production and is nearing operational readiness for the country's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian. Military observers note that the jets are shown with official naval markings and serial numbers, including the "Flying Shark" insignia on their tails, providing the strongest evidence yet of their formal integration into the naval aviation force. According to a former People's Liberation Army instructor, these details indicate that the J-35 is likely in a low-rate initial production phase. The development marks a significant step forward in China's military modernization and naval capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Family of Man Fatally Injured in MRI Accident Alleges Technician Negligence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The family of a 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine on Long Island is claiming the technician was at fault. They state the technician invited the man into the procedure room to assist his wife but failed to warn him about the danger of the metal chain he was wearing. The powerful magnetic force trapped him against the machine for nearly an hour, and he later died from multiple heart attacks following the incident. The family's account contradicts initial reports suggesting he was unauthorized to be in the room, adding a tragic layer to the rare but devastating accident.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 immigrants from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The decision removes protections against deportation for these individuals while a lawsuit challenging the termination continues through the courts. Advocacy groups have expressed alarm, warning that families will be separated and lives endangered if people are forced to return to what they argue are still unsafe home countries. The administration contends that the program was always intended to be temporary and that conditions in those nations have sufficiently improved.</p>

          <p>Political critics and commentators are accusing President Trump of intentionally creating distractions, such as demanding a name change for the Washington Commanders, to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files. The article notes that the administration's handling of the files has caused frustration even among some of the president's supporters. The White House has denied these claims, maintaining that the president is being transparent and addressing issues his supporters care about. This comes amid polling that shows declining approval for the president on key issues like immigration.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they have a potential positive side effect. The pressure from these tariffs is reportedly prompting countries like Canada and China, as well as the European Union, to re-examine and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. The author suggests that this move toward economic liberalization could unlock significant domestic economic potential that was previously hindered by protectionist policies. The crisis has thus exposed hypocrisy and may lead to more efficient, open markets globally, representing a silver lining to a controversial policy.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods in Texas, officials have accounted for the vast majority of over 160 people who were initially reported missing in the hardest-hit areas. The high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists and campers leaving the area without checking in after the disaster. This sharp revision in the count is common after large-scale emergencies, as initial reports are often chaotic. While the floods tragically claimed at least 135 lives, the confirmation that most of the missing are safe has brought significant relief to the community and emergency responders working in the aftermath.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that the Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and raising the possibility of an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration could eventually require the removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an event known as a "negative leap second," to keep atomic clocks aligned with the planet's rotation. While the effect is imperceptible in daily life, it poses a significant challenge for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise time. The trend is influenced by factors like the moon's gravity, though it is currently being partially counteracted by the slowing effect of melting polar ice.</p>

          <h2>Legal Group Founded by Stephen Miller Files Complaint Against Johns Hopkins Over DEI Policies</h2>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate what it calls "illegal DEI practices" at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The complaint alleges that the university uses diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as a proxy for race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating federal civil rights laws. The group claims these policies compromise medical standards by prioritizing ideology over merit. This action is part of a broader conservative legal effort targeting DEI programs in higher education following the Supreme Court's ruling against affirmative action.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Kentucky police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that led to her death. He is the only officer to be convicted in connection with the incident. The sentence was handed down despite a controversial recommendation from the Trump-led Justice Department for only one day in prison, a position the judge rejected. Taylor's family expressed gratitude for the prison time but criticized the prosecution for seeking a lighter sentence, highlighting the political shifts that have impacted the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that the Trump presidency is characterized more by personal pettiness and vengeance than by a coherent policy agenda. The article cites multiple examples, including attacks on the Federal Reserve chairman, the renaming of military bases, and shifting stances on Ukraine, suggesting these actions are driven by emotional reactions to perceived slights. According to the author, this focus on settling personal scores and picking culture-war fights creates a chaotic and unpredictable style of governance. The piece concludes that while this may appeal to some supporters, it lacks substance and direction for the country.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is set to use military bases in Indiana and New Jersey to detain immigrants, according to correspondence with the Pentagon. The plan, approved by the Defense Secretary, will provide space for up to 1,000 people at each location to support ICE removal operations. The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to detain more individuals in the country without legal status, exceeding current detention capacity. The plan has been condemned by Democratic lawmakers, who called it an inappropriate use of military resources and a threat to military preparedness.</p>

          <p>The nomination of Emil Bove to the federal bench is being highlighted as a key example of how President Trump is reshaping the federal courts in his second term. Unlike the first term's focus on Federalist Society-backed originalists, Bove's nomination represents a new, more controversial phase in judicial appointments. The article suggests that this shift could lead to a judiciary that is more aligned with the MAGA movement's political agenda. Bove's nomination is currently one step away from confirmation, signaling a potential new era for the federal judiciary's composition and ideological direction.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's latest tax bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, while funding the lost revenue through significant cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs, which will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement and removes tax credits for renewable energy. Critics argue the legislation will not produce sustained economic benefits and will worsen the country's financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in federal court over the decision to freeze more than $2 billion in federal research grants to the university. The administration claims the move is necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge appeared skeptical of, questioning how cutting medical research funding would achieve this goal. Harvard's lawyers argued the cuts are an attempt to control the university's inner workings and will harm vital research without evidence of impact on antisemitism. The case is part of a broader conflict that also includes a White House move to restrict Harvard's access to foreign student visas.</p>
