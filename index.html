          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to reduce sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030, marking the first time a specific target has been set on this issue. This announcement follows public outrage over increased pollution and a recent Environment Agency report showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The plan also includes a ban on plastic-containing wet wipes and aims to cut phosphorus pollution, as water companies face scrutiny for paying large executive bonuses amid rising consumer bills and environmental failures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Met Office has issued multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across the country, indicating a risk of flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts are still possible. The heavy rainfall follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing the likelihood of severe runoff. Warnings remain in place for Scotland, Wales, and much of England into the new week.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon, according to multiple sources. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before his promotion. His departure is part of a broader staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office following a March scandal involving the leak of sensitive military plans on the Signal messaging app. In a statement, Fulcher indicated his planned six-month term of service had concluded as expected.</p>

          <p>A Virginia man has pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges after authorities discovered approximately 150 pipe bombs and other explosives at his residence, the largest such seizure in FBI history. Prosecutors alleged that Brad Spafford had also made threatening comments, including cheering for "political assassinations" and hoping a shooter targeting a political figure would not miss. Spafford, who previously lost three fingers in a homemade explosives accident, faces up to 10 years in prison on each charge and will be sentenced in December.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy remains in contention at The Open after a dramatic third round that included a bizarre moment when his club struck a buried golf ball in the rough, leading to a bogey.

          <p>Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing sanctions on a Brazilian Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration placed visa restrictions on Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, a move Lula called unacceptable "interference" that violates national sovereignty. The sanctions followed a ruling by Moraes that Bolsonaro must wear an electronic monitor. The US State Department justified the action by accusing the judge of conducting a "political witch hunt" against the Trump ally.</p>

          <p>Flanker Tom Curry delivered a phenomenal performance to help the British and Irish Lions secure a 27-19 victory against Australia in their first Test match. Coach Andy Farrell described Curry's contribution as "immense," as he answered critics with a display of relentless aggression and physicality, which included scoring a try. Curry set the tone from the start with a massive tackle and was a constant disruptive force. His efforts, alongside fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne, were instrumental in the Lions building a decisive lead and taking control of the match in Brisbane.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during protests against the government's decision to classify the pro-Palestine activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Demonstrations took place in several major cities, with protesters holding signs stating, "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The majority of arrests, including 55 in London, were made under the Terrorism Act, which criminalizes support for the group. The proscription followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged military aircraft.</p>

          <p>Witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza report that Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians near aid distribution sites, killing 32 people and wounding dozens more. The incidents occurred near hubs run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in southern Gaza. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after a group approached its forces and ignored calls to stop, and that it is investigating the reports. This event adds to the hundreds of deaths reported at or near these aid sites, highlighting the deadly chaos surrounding food distribution amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's handling of slow play at The Open after both were warned by officials during the third round. Stenson expressed frustration over what he perceived as inconsistent enforcement, noting that earlier rounds ran significantly over time with no action taken. DeChambeau, whose group was put on the clock, called the first two days "out of control" and advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness. The controversy highlights ongoing debates about pace of play in professional golf.</p>

          <p>Russia unleashed a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, firing over 300 drones and 30 cruise missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. At least one person was killed in the Black Sea port of Odesa, where a residential building caught fire, and critical infrastructure was damaged in the Sumy region. This barrage is part of an intensified Russian bombing campaign that increasingly uses a high volume of drones in a single night. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 71 Ukrainian drones during the same period as they approached Russian territory.</p>

          <p>Members of the Pennsylvania-based Christian group Generation Life are engaging in "beach outreach" on the Jersey shore, advocating for chastity to their peers. The young activists are attempting to reframe the concept away from simple abstinence and towards a "countercultural" ideal of deeper intimacy and self-worth in an age of transactional, social-media-driven relationships. While most beachgoers were unreceptive, the group sees its mission as a way to address what they perceive as the brokenness and pain caused by modern dating culture, hoping to plant a seed of doubt about casual sex and relationships.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house elections, far-right parties like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are capitalizing on growing anti-immigration sentiment to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. These groups are fanning concerns over unruly tourists and crimes allegedly committed by foreigners, echoing rhetoric from Western nationalist movements. While Japan faces severe labor shortages due to a declining birthrate, these parties argue against relying on foreign workers and advocate for a "Japanese First" policy. This nationalist push comes as the government's popularity is falling, creating a volatile political landscape.</p>
