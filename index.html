          <p>Charles Rangel, a prominent Harlem Democrat and former U.S. congressman from New York, has passed away at the age of 94. Rangel, a Korean War veteran and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, served in the House of Representatives for 46 years, becoming the first African American to chair the House Ways and Means Committee. His career was marked by advocacy for affordable housing, urban revitalization, and fair tax policies, though he faced an ethics censure in 2010. He was also the last surviving member of Harlem's "Gang of Four," a group of influential Black political figures. The Lion of Lenox Avenue's legacy includes a commitment to fighting for the "little guy" and opposing the Iraq war.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming North American and UK concerts after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. The condition, exacerbated by recent concert performances, requires physical therapy and a period of abstaining from performing. Joel expressed regret for disappointing his audience and gratitude for their understanding. The 76-year-old musician had previously undergone surgery and physical therapy in March, though it is unclear if those issues were related to his current diagnosis.

          <p>Israel is facing increasing isolation as even its closest allies, including the United States under President Trump, express impatience with the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Trump's recent call for a swift end to the war contrasts with his earlier stance of blaming Hamas for the conflict's continuation. Germany and Italy have also voiced strong criticism of Israel's actions, while Britain, Canada, and France have taken concrete steps such as suspending trade negotiations and imposing sanctions. Despite these shifts in tone, these countries continue to provide practical support to Israel through military and intelligence partnerships. Prime Minister Netanyahu has remained defiant, accusing these nations of emboldening Hamas.</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests a different picture of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time work but unable to find it and those in poverty-wage jobs, stood at 24.3% in April, significantly higher than the official rate of 4.2%. This measure aims to capture nuances missed by traditional economic indicators, highlighting the struggles of Americans unable to afford basic needs. The report also notes disparities among racial and gender groups, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers facing higher rates of functional unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

This criticism follows a weekend of intense bombardments on Ukrainian cities and comes shortly after Trump described an "excellent" phone call with Putin, promising immediate peace negotiations. Despite expressing shock at the attacks, Trump has not linked them to his decision to refuse new financial sanctions or provide further aid to Ukraine. Experts suggest this pattern signals a pullback from the conflict, leaving Ukraine vulnerable to further Russian aggression.</p>

European negotiators are hesitant to agree to many of Trump’s demands, such as changing their consumption tax system and rolling back digital regulations. Meanwhile, EU negotiators hope to reduce tariffs implemented in April, but the Trump administration indicates that the current 10 percent is likely to be the new floor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of electric vehicles, noting their popularity a century ago and subsequent decline due to factors like cheaper gasoline cars and lack of infrastructure. It draws parallels to current challenges, including political opposition and limited charging availability. While electric car sales are growing globally, the U.S. market faces headwinds from Republican policies aiming to eliminate subsidies and impose new fees. The article also highlights gender stereotypes associated with electric vehicles and the efforts to broaden their appeal.

The delay, granted after a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a brief window for negotiations. Experts suggest that while the six-week extension may not be sufficient to resolve all detailed issues, it could allow for the establishment of a trade agreement framework.

          <p>Republicans in Congress revoked California's authority to set certain mandates on electric vehicles, viewing it as a challenge to the state's outsized influence on national policy. California has long been able to adopt its own emissions regulations, effectively setting the bar for carmakers nationally. Republicans argue that electric vehicles are impractical for their constituents and that California's policies should not dictate choices for other states. The move reflects a broader ideological clash between Republican states tied to the fossil fuel industry and California's push toward cleaner energy.</p>

          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada, marked by ceremonial events and a Speech from the Throne, is viewed as a strategic move to underscore Canadian sovereignty amidst strained relations with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to the King is seen as a response to US President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs and disparaging remarks about Canada. The King's visit serves as a symbolic gesture of support for Canada's independence and its enduring relationship with the Crown. The Speech from the Throne is expected to outline the government's agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session.</p>

          <p>EU leaders are optimistic about reaching a swift resolution to the trade war with the US after President Trump delayed his threatened 50% tariffs. The European Commission president persuaded Trump to extend the deadline by more than a month to allow for further negotiations. The EU trade commissioner is scheduled to speak with the US commerce secretary. Despite the optimism, uncertainty remains, and businesses are unsure of what plans to make, the flip-flopping on border taxes has left many businesses unsure of what plans to make, with many withdrawing their financial forecasts in response.
