To navigate this volatile environment, JPMorgan recommends structured notes for defensive exposure and income generation, and hedge funds for diversification and exploiting market mispricings.

            <p>President Trump is threatening to cut another $1 billion in funding for Harvard University, this time targeting health research, as the administration's conflict with elite schools intensifies. The administration has already withheld funding from Harvard and other universities due to their handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Trump officials were reportedly angered when Harvard released a confidential list of demands from the administration to the public. Trump has been cracking down on top U.S. universities, citing mishandling of protests and allowing antisemitism to intensify on campus.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual unions for practical benefits, are gaining traction, with a Tokyo-based agency facilitating over 300 such arrangements in the past decade. These marriages often involve individuals who are not sexually attracted to their partners but seek companionship and social security benefits. Despite societal norms emphasizing traditional marriage, these unions offer an alternative for those who cannot find love or sex with the opposite gender. Experts suggest that friendship marriages may be a response to the lack of same-sex marriage recognition and the desire for social acceptance and practical rewards.</p>

            <p>Despite the government's "free hours" scheme, parents in England still face challenges in finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. A report by Ofsted found that areas with lower incomes are disproportionately affected by low access to childcare. Experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out. Private nurseries are facing increased operating costs, and some have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether. Working families must meet specific criteria to qualify for the free hours, leaving some families ineligible for support.</p>

            <p>Data indicates that men visit doctors less often than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe. Societal expectations of masculinity, such as self-reliance and not showing vulnerability, contribute to this reluctance. A survey reveals that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" and fear being seen as weak if they discuss health concerns. Appointment systems that don't accommodate work schedules and services that rely on open communication also deter men from seeking medical help.</p>
