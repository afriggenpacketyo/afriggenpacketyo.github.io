        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS has reversed a 70-year interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, stating in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This change stems from a lawsuit filed by the National Religious Broadcasters and two churches, who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. The new interpretation specifies that communications from a house of worship to its congregation on electoral politics, viewed through a religious lens, do not constitute prohibited campaign intervention. A judge has not yet ruled on the joint motion to resolve the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Unprecedented flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 105 deaths and dozens of people missing. The disaster, fueled by a massive weather system, occurred over a holiday weekend, catching residents and campers by surprise as the river rose 26 feet in 45 minutes. Officials are facing scrutiny over the timeliness of warnings, citing the event's "100-year flood" severity and previous public resistance to a costly warning system. A massive search and rescue operation is ongoing amid a federal disaster declaration.</p>

          <p>In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, a mob of villagers brutally murdered five members of a single family after accusing them of witchcraft. The victims, including three women, were hacked to death and their bodies were burned, reportedly because the family was blamed for a local boy's fatal illness. Police have arrested three suspects but noted that many other villagers were involved and are not cooperating with the investigation. The family's 16-year-old son was the sole survivor of the attack, which highlights the ongoing issue of superstition-based violence in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. magistrate judge has recommended that the criminal case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan should not be dismissed. Dugan was charged with obstruction and concealing a person from arrest for allegedly helping a man in the U.S. illegally evade immigration authorities at her courthouse. She had sought to have the indictment dismissed, arguing for judicial immunity and citing the recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. The magistrate judge, however, concluded that judicial immunity from civil suits does not extend to criminal prosecutions for alleged crimes committed while performing official duties.</p>

These phrases reinforce feelings of acceptance, teamwork, and commitment, such as "You see me as I am" and "We'll get through this." The article emphasizes that trust is the foundation of emotional security, allowing partners to be vulnerable and handle conflict without fear. Building this level of security is a conscious effort that requires self-acceptance and a commitment to growing together over time.</p>

The warrants accuse the leaders of crimes against humanity, marking a significant step by the international legal body to hold the Taliban accountable for its repressive actions.

A recent memo outlined the change, which allows passengers in general security lines to keep their shoes on, a privilege previously reserved for TSA PreCheck members. The new policy aims to expedite the screening process, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove their shoes for additional checks.

The plot was part of a series of "missions" for Wagner, which also included plans to attack businesses owned by a prominent Russian dissident in London.

The author argues that by failing to provide reasoning, the Court is acting like a political body rather than a judicial one and rewarding the administration's defiance of the lower court's ruling.

          <p>An opinion column from The Arizona Republic argues that several Republican representatives from Arizona sold out their constituents by supporting Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The author contends that the bill provides immediate tax cuts for the wealthy while delaying painful cuts to programs like Medicaid until after the 2026 midterm elections. The piece highlights that Arizona would be one of the states hit hardest by the $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts due to a state "trigger law" that would repeal its expansion program. The columnist concludes that the representatives prioritized fealty to Trump over the well-being of Arizonans.</p>

          <p>An article in Vox explores the ongoing debate about whether American children and young adults are experiencing a literacy crisis. It weighs the perennial complaint that "kids can't read" against recent data showing a decline in reading scores, particularly among younger students since 2013. The piece discusses various potential causes, including the failure of some teaching methods, the impact of the pandemic, and the rise of screen time. While some experts argue standardized tests don't capture modern forms of literacy, others express an urgent need to address the foundational skills gap.</p>

The investigation will examine how public agencies handled the perpetrator's "deteriorating and deeply troubling behaviour" and whether there were missed opportunities to prevent the tragedy.

          <p>An article from DW examines the reasons behind Donald Trump's strong opposition to the BRICS bloc of economies, which he views as a threat to the U.S. dollar's global dominance. Trump has threatened additional tariffs on nations supporting the group's "anti-American policies" as BRICS members intensify efforts to trade in local currencies. While the bloc has expanded to include nearly half the world's population, its "dedollarization" efforts face challenges, including internal rifts and the dollar's deep-rooted role in global trade. Analysts suggest that while BRICS represents a clear anti-Western sentiment, its practical influence remains limited for now. (not investment advice)</p>

While companies like Shein and Temu have faced sales slumps, the industry as a whole is nimble and not tied to any single country, with brands shifting production to other regions to avoid tariffs. The piece contends that focusing solely on fast fashion scapegoats the entire apparel industry, which is plagued by widespread labor and environmental issues.
