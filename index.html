          <p>Robert Andrews Jr., initially perceived as an average father, was the mastermind of a multi-million pound drug empire selling cocaine and heroin in South Wales. Police uncovered his operation after finding incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone, leading to extensive surveillance. Covert operations revealed brazen drug deals and the use of unique bank notes as "tokens" for large cash exchanges. Andrews Jr. was eventually sentenced to 14 years and eight months in prison for conspiracy and supply charges, with authorities noting his funneling of illicit gains into a lavish unfinished home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that cannabis use, particularly its active ingredient THC, negatively impacts female fertility and the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Researchers found that THC disrupts egg cell development and genetic stability, leading to a significantly lower rate of healthy embryos in THC-positive patients. The study, involving over 1,000 women, observed more errors in chromosome distribution and defective egg cell structures in the presence of THC. Experts emphasize the need for further research across different age groups and consumption habits to clarify the full systemic effects.</p>

          <p>China has issued four travel advisories since April, warning its citizens of "unstable public security" and "numerous crimes targeting Chinese citizens" in the Philippines. Analysts suggest these warnings could slow down two-way trade, investment, and higher education exchanges if Chinese citizens heed them. While the average Chinese visitor for legal purposes rarely faces issues, the rapid succession of advisories raises questions about their impact on economic links between the two nations. The advisories reflect growing tensions and could signal a cooling of business ties.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford made history by defeating Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas, becoming the first male fighter in the modern era to hold undisputed titles in three weight divisions. The unbeaten 37-year-old delivered a masterclass performance, showcasing exceptional skill, defense, power, and timing against the 35-year-old Alvarez. Despite the judges' tight scoring, the victory cemented Crawford's status as boxing's pound-for-pound star on a grand stage. This defining moment for Crawford, his 42nd straight professional win, left open the possibility of his retirement.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, Germany continues to grapple with the legacy of the racist Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which systematically disenfranchised and persecuted Jewish Germans and other groups. These laws, which legalized injustice by distinguishing between "Reich citizens" and "state citizens," are seen by historians as directly comparable to modern far-right rhetoric about "real Germans" versus "passport Germans." The article highlights how fundamental values of equality enshrined in Germany's Basic Law are being challenged today, with racial discrimination based on ancestry remaining a problem.

          <p>A growing number of teenagers are engaging in intense "cut and bulk" cycles, driven by social media trends, to achieve highly muscular physiques. This regimen involves periods of consuming excess calories to gain muscle, followed by restrictive dieting to lose fat, often involving frequent gym visits and calorie counting. While some teenagers like 14-year-old bodybuilder George Holland advocate for the mental and physical discipline, sports nutritionists warn of potential harm to hormone health, growth, and development, and the risk of eating disorders like muscle dysmorphia. Experts recommend balanced diets and caution against extreme regimes or unverified advice found online.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), faces a critical legal showdown on September 15 that could declare its recent leadership elections "null and void." This trial, stemming from challenges by the traditional nationalist wing against the reformist leadership of Ozgur Ozel and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, threatens to plunge the party into chaos. Observers suggest President Erdogan may be strategically exploiting these internal divisions to weaken the opposition. The outcome could significantly impact Imamoglu's political future, potentially sidelining him despite his growing popularity as Erdogan's main challenger.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel amid heightened tensions with Middle East allies following Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar and continued settlement expansion in the West Bank. The US, including President Trump, expressed unhappiness over the Qatar strike, which targeted Hamas officials discussing a ceasefire proposal, but reiterated that it would not alter the US-Israeli relationship. Rubio's visit aims to understand Israel's future plans, while international criticism mounts over Israel's conduct in Gaza and the UN General Assembly backs a two-state solution. The US, however, remains committed to fighting anti-Israel actions and ensuring Hamas does not rule Gaza.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas have publicly accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the "one obstacle" to their loved ones' return and a peace deal. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum stated that Israel's recent strike on Qatar, targeting Hamas leaders, demonstrates Netanyahu's pattern of sabotaging deals as they approach. They claim his "stalling" has already cost the lives of 42 hostages and endangers others, urging an end to excuses designed to cling to power.

          <p>Taiwan's heavy reliance on imported energy is identified as its most critical vulnerability in the event of a conflict with Beijing, with experts warning that a prolonged blockade could paralyze the island within days. A report from the Foundation for Defence of Democracies highlights Taiwan's limited storage capacity, creating a "strategic liability." The think tank suggests China could employ "cyber-enabled economic warfare, selective maritime quarantines and diplomatic pressure" on Taiwan's energy providers to quickly undermine societal resilience and economic continuity.

These funds, primarily for the U.S. Marshals Service, will include enhanced protection for Supreme Court justices. The White House also supports increased funding for congressional lawmakers' security, with a pilot program already launched for House members. This move underscores growing concerns about threats to public officials, as the U.S. Capitol Police anticipate tracking over 14,000 threats this year, prompting a "heightened posture" for security operations.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have voted to ban PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, and other household items. The bill, Senate Bill 682, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, with compliance deadlines extending to 2030 for cookware. This move is driven by health risks associated with PFAS exposure, including cancer and organ damage, as these chemicals persist in the environment and accumulate in humans. The legislation faces pushback from some chefs and the cookware industry, who argue certain PFAS types like PTFE (Teflon) are safe when used correctly, but environmental groups maintain concerns about particle and fume release.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called on all NATO countries to cease buying Russian oil and impose tariffs on China for its purchases, asserting this would swiftly end the war in Ukraine. In a letter purportedly sent to NATO, Trump criticized the alliance's "less than 100%" commitment and deemed member purchases of Russian oil "shocking." He proposed 50-100% tariffs on China, to be withdrawn if the war ends, believing China's influence over Russia is strong enough to break its "grip."

Rosie experienced severe anxiety, self-harm, and night terrors due to the overwhelming school environment, leading her mother to eventually withdraw her for out-of-school education. School leaders confirm a "big increase" in EBSA, particularly post-Covid, attributing it to factors like sensory needs, social media pressures, and general teenage anxiety. The article emphasizes the need for a "support first" approach, with some schools implementing specialist units and mental health provisions to address this growing issue.</p>
