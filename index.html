          <p>PepsiCo announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance outside of North America. Despite this, the company experienced a decline in sales volume within the U.S. for both its food and beverage divisions. In response, PepsiCo is focusing on new strategies, such as expanding its protein-based products and multicultural offerings, to revitalize domestic sales. The company has maintained its full-year financial forecast, anticipating stable earnings and low single-digit organic revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration's Department of Justice is deprioritizing the enforcement of white-collar crimes, particularly those involving corporate allies or financial institutions. Federal prosecutions for such offenses have reportedly declined, and the administration has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, framing it as a move to enhance American economic competitiveness. This approach, which contrasts with a tough stance on crimes related to immigration, has led to concerns from critics that it may encourage corporate malfeasance while being used to target political opponents.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is showing signs of weakening, with the unemployment rate climbing to 4.7%, a four-year high, and annual pay growth slowing to 5%. Job vacancies have also been declining for three consecutive years, prompting businesses to reduce hiring, partly due to increased national insurance contributions. These economic indicators have led analysts to believe the Bank of England is more likely to cut interest rates in its upcoming meeting to stimulate the economy. The government acknowledged the need for further economic improvement amidst criticism from opposition parties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to the federal student loan system, notably ending the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan. This plan was designed to offer more affordable monthly payments, and its elimination is expected to cause financial stress for many borrowers, with some payments potentially doubling. The new framework will reduce the number of repayment options for future borrowers to just two: a standard plan and a new income-based option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Consumer advocates warn that these changes could leave many borrowers without affordable options, increasing their risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that because Trump faces little political risk from his right-wing base, he is less susceptible to pressure from pro-Israel lobbying groups than other presidents. The article points to past instances where Trump has diverged from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's preferences. It suggests that Trump's transactional nature and desire for accolades like a Nobel Peace Prize could potentially be leveraged to push for a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Sean Combs's Mann Act Conviction Raises Concerns About Prosecutorial Overreach</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while many sought accountability for Sean Combs, his conviction under the Mann Act should be viewed with caution. The author contends that this century-old law, originally intended to combat sex trafficking, is overly broad and has a history of being used for discriminatory purposes, such as targeting interracial couples. The piece suggests that relying on such archaic statutes to secure convictions when more serious charges fail can lead to unjust outcomes and gives prosecutors excessive power. The conviction is presented as a poor substitute for justice on the more severe allegations of sex trafficking and racketeering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weeks after the Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles to handle immigration-related unrest, many service members are reportedly underutilized and stationed at local bases. California's governor and L.A.'s mayor, who opposed the deployment, are now demanding a complete withdrawal, arguing the troops are being used as "political pawns" and are needed for state duties like wildfire prevention. While some troops were involved in tense missions, sources suggest the vast majority have not been on daily missions, leading to criticism that the military presence is a performative and unnecessary use of resources.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party is investigating comments made by veteran MP Diane Abbott, in which she reiterated controversial views on racism that previously led to her suspension. In a recent interview, Abbott stood by her 2023 assertion that racism experienced by Black people is distinct from prejudice faced by Jewish people or Travellers, because skin color is immediately visible. The party stated it is taking the matter "incredibly seriously" and will assess it under its internal rules. Abbott had previously apologized for the original comments but was suspended from the party for a year.</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the viral success of synthetic bands like The Velvet Sundown, is causing significant concern within the music industry. Platforms like Suno and Udio allow for the easy creation of entire songs, which are now populating streaming services and generating revenue, creating new competition for human artists. While some see AI as a creative tool, many musicians and industry professionals worry about copyright infringement, the devaluation of human artistry, and the difficulty for new artists to gain traction. Major record labels have responded by filing lawsuits against AI music platforms for alleged mass copyright violations.</p>

          <p>A faction of President Trump's loyal supporters is expressing rare public frustration over the administration's failure to release the so-called Jeffrey Epstein "client list." Despite the Justice Department stating no such list exists, the issue has become a fixation for many in the MAGA movement, who see it as a key part of the anti-establishment agenda. This backlash threatens to overshadow recent legislative achievements and has led to calls for the removal of top law enforcement officials. While some supporters remain patient, others are demanding accountability and justice, creating a notable rift within Trump's base.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials reviewing black box data from the crashed Air India jet believe the captain likely cut off the fuel supply moments before the disaster in Ahmedabad. The cockpit voice recording reportedly captured the first officer's panicked questioning of the captain's action, while the captain remained calm. A preliminary report had already found that fuel control switches were turned off, leading to a catastrophic loss of power. The investigation is also examining the captain's medical records amid claims he had been suffering from depression, though no conclusions have been finalized.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian Olympic champion fencer Olga Kharlan has expressed deep concern that the sport of fencing could lose its Olympic status due to growing Russian influence. Her warning follows a decision by the International Fencing Federation (FIE) to relax neutrality rules, allowing Russian military-affiliated athletes to compete. Kharlan, along with hundreds of other fencers, argues this move undermines the sport's integrity, especially as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues. She fears the controversy and perceived corruption, linked to Russian financial influence within the FIE, could lead to the sport's exclusion from future Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously allocated federal funding, following a request from the White House. The measure, approved in a 51-48 vote, claws back funds from the Department of State, USAID, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This move represents a significant budgetary shift, redirecting money away from international assistance and domestic public media. The bill now heads back to the House for final approval ahead of a Friday deadline, highlighting the administration's focus on cutting specific areas of federal spending.</p>

          <p>Communities across Virginia, the state with the world's highest concentration of data centers, are mounting strong resistance to new projects. Residents cite concerns over the massive power and water consumption required by these facilities, as well as constant noise from their cooling systems. The surge in demand, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence, has led to plans for dozens of new hyperscale data centers, which would nearly triple the state's power grid capacity. This has sparked a widespread "not-in-my-backyard" movement, with local groups successfully blocking some developments over environmental and quality-of-life issues.</p>
