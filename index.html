          <p>U.S. Steel's stock price increased after President Trump approved its merger with Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement that includes a golden share for the U.S. government. This golden share grants the U.S. president significant control over the company's decisions, ensuring production levels are maintained and other strategic interests are protected. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions. All regulatory approvals have been secured, marking a significant step towards finalizing the transaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As G7 leaders convene in Canada, discussions are expected to center on trade instability, the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East, and whether President Trump is aligned with allies on major geopolitical issues. Trade tensions, exacerbated by U.S. tariffs, remain a primary concern, with Japan and the EU seeking deals before potential tariff increases take effect in July. Bilateral meetings are anticipated, but the likelihood of significant trade agreements being reached remains uncertain. The summit aims to foster consensus and coordinate actions on global challenges, though internal divisions pose a challenge to achieving these goals.</p>

Prime Minister Netanyahu suggests that regime change could result from the conflict, urging Iranian citizens to seize the opportunity.

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to drop live mosquitoes in remote forests as a novel approach to combat avian malaria, which threatens the state's endangered honeycreepers. The mosquitoes are male and carry a strain of bacteria that prevents their eggs from hatching when they mate with local females. This method aims to reduce the population of biting mosquitoes and thus curb the spread of malaria to the remaining bird populations. This approach has little ecological downside, since mosquitoes are not native to the islands.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's efforts at rapprochement with Russia have created an uncomfortable situation for Vladimir Putin, disrupting Russia's propaganda efforts and foreign policy strategies. Trump's attempts to forge a settlement between Russia and Ukraine have forced Putin to compete with Zelensky for the White House's favor. The Russian leader has been compelled to negotiate with the king of Manhattan real estate, as Trump's focus on forging a settlement makes it difficult for the Kremlin to maintain its antagonistic stance. Trump's erratic economic policies have also intensified fiscal pressure on the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Millions of SNAP recipients are facing potential cuts and changes to the program, including restrictions on sugary foods and new work requirements. These changes could significantly impact low-income families and college students who rely on SNAP to afford food. Some states may choose to abandon the program altogether due to federal cuts. Critics argue that restricting food choices is not as effective as expanding access to healthy foods and that the changes do not consider the program's fundamental purpose.</p>

          <p>The FCC is delaying the implementation of multilingual emergency alerts, leaving millions of Americans who speak languages other than English and Spanish without access to critical information during disasters. Despite a unanimous vote to require alerts in 13 languages and American Sign Language, the report has not been published in the Federal Register. This delay is attributed to an executive order requiring review by the Trump administration. Advocates argue that this is a matter of life and death, as people need to understand emergency instructions to stay safe.</p>
