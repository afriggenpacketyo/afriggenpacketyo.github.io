          <p>Golfer Rory McIlroy strongly condemned the "unacceptable and abusive behavior" displayed by American fans at the Ryder Cup, revealing his wife was struck by a thrown drink. He expressed deep disappointment that golf, a sport traditionally known for its etiquette and respect, fell short of its standards this week. Despite the hostile crowd and personal affronts, Europe secured a 15-13 victory, which McIlroy proudly called the cap to his best career year. He vowed to ensure such incidents are prevented at the next Ryder Cup, scheduled for Ireland in 2027, emphasizing the need for higher standards in the sport.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, achieved a clear victory and a new parliamentary majority in recent elections. Sandu had previously warned of significant Russian interference, with bomb scares reported at polling stations across multiple countries and arrests made for plotting unrest. The outcome is seen as crucial for Moldova's future path towards EU integration, despite the nation grappling with spiraling prices and high corruption. This election signifies a strong public endorsement for a European alignment, reinforcing the country's direction away from Russian influence.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at the Kickapoo Lucky Eagle Casino in Eagle Pass, Texas, resulted in the deaths of two individuals, including Marcus "Mark" Antley, a beloved retired U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent.

Authorities swiftly arrested Keryan Rashad Jones, 34, in Wilson County following a chase, and he now faces two counts of capital murder and five counts of assault with a deadly weapon. Local officials, including Mayor Aaron Valdez, praised law enforcement's coordinated response and expressed profound condolences to the grieving families, condemning the senseless violence.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United striker and club legend Wayne Rooney voiced deep concerns about the club's current state, emphatically stating it is "broken" and that he has "no faith" in manager Ruben Amorim to instigate a turnaround. Following a disappointing 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Rooney criticized many current players for lacking fight, character, and desire, suggesting some "don't deserve to wear the shirt." He called for significant changes from the ownership, lamenting the perceived loss of the club's "soul" and a culture where long-serving staff are losing jobs. Rooney believes a new engine and lease of life are desperately needed.</p>

          <h2>US Ryder Cup Captain Calls for Change to "Envelope Rule" After European Player Withdrawal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 01:23:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley advocated for a significant change to the "envelope rule" before the next contest in Ireland in 2027, following Europe's Viktor Hovland's withdrawal due to a neck injury. This controversial rule mandates that if one team's player pulls out, the opposing captain must also name a player to miss, resulting in a half-point for both teams. Bradley argued the rule unfairly impacted his team's efforts to stage a comeback, as Europe was awarded a half-point without playing a match. European captain Luke Donald, however, defended the rule, citing its long-standing history and contractual basis within the tournament.</p>

          <p>Devastating heavy rains in Arizona have led to at least three confirmed deaths and widespread flooding, particularly in Globe, a rural mining town, where approximately 1,000 residential-sized propane tanks were dispersed, creating an extremely hazardous situation. The Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport recorded its highest one-day rainfall in nearly seven years, contributing to the rapid inundation. Emergency services are conducting a massive search and rescue operation, with officials urging residents to stay away from floodwaters to avoid further casualties. Local authorities have declared an emergency, describing the event as unprecedented in its intensity and destructive power.</p>

          <p>A critical review of Kamala Harris's memoir, "107 Days," portrays it as a revealing look into the Democratic establishment's perceived disconnect and lack of self-awareness. The article argues the book shows Harris as a politician focused primarily on the machinery of politics, presentation, and celebrity endorsements rather than distinct conviction or a unique policy agenda. It suggests the campaign relied heavily on spectacle, ultimately failing to genuinely connect with voters outside a political bubble. The review concludes that the memoir underscores a deeper issue within the Democratic party's approach to challenging Trumpism and its inability to self-reflect on past failures.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs anticipates that China's central bank will likely ease its monetary policy in the fourth quarter, projecting a 10-basis-point policy rate cut and a 50-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio. This forecast stems from slowing economic momentum and increasing pressure on policymakers to bolster growth, especially as year-on-year growth could dip sharply towards 4% from a high base last year. However, the data-dependent nature of the People's Bank of China's decisions leaves open the risk of no action if the "around 5 percent" annual growth target remains on track.

          <p>The karearea, New Zealand's sole native falcon species, has won the country's annual Bird of the Year competition, garnering over 75,000 votes from 123 countries. This swift raptor, capable of flying 200 kilometers per hour, is threatened by habitat loss and predation, with only an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 individuals remaining. The competition, which draws significant public engagement, aims to raise crucial awareness about New Zealand's unique native bird species, 80% of which face various levels of threat. This highlights the urgent need for increased conservation efforts against habitat destruction, climate change, and introduced predators.</p>

          <p>Shares of Sony Financial Group surged 36% on its market debut Monday, following its spin-off from parent company Sony Group. The strategic move, which values the financial arm at over $6.7 billion, allows the unit to independently raise its own growth capital while maintaining brand ties with the wider Sony ecosystem. Sony Group cited competing investment demands in its entertainment and semiconductor divisions as a key reason for the financial unit to operate independently. This development occurred as broader Asian markets traded mostly higher, with investors assessing tariff developments and anticipating the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, authorized by the Secretary of Defense. State Attorney General Dan Rayfield argues President Trump lacks authority to federalize the National Guard, asserting that local officials possess the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference. The White House defends the deployment as lawful, aimed at protecting federal property "where protests are occurring or likely to occur" from "left-wing rioters." Governor Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson have also publicly opposed the move, calling it an abuse of power.</p>
