          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated he would consider sending National Guard troops to Baltimore to combat crime, escalating a political dispute with Maryland's Democratic Governor, Wes Moore. This follows Trump's deployment of troops to Washington D.C., a move he claims brought "total safety" to the city despite data showing a decrease in violent crime. The proposal has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who view the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement as a potential abuse of power and a political tactic to create a crisis.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood has won his first-ever PGA Tour title, securing the Tour Championship after 164 attempts on the circuit. The 34-year-old maintained his lead throughout the final day, finishing three shots ahead of competitors Scottie Scheffler and Patrick Cantlay. The victory, which comes with a $10 million prize, was an emotional moment for Fleetwood, who celebrated with his Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose. This significant win sheds his reputation as a 'nearly man' on the American tour and builds momentum ahead of the upcoming Ryder Cup.</p>

          <p>Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was reportedly asked to leave Georgica Beach in East Hampton, New York, due to closures enforced for dangerous conditions caused by Hurricane Erin. Photos show Blinken and a companion being approached by a lifeguard before packing up their belongings and departing the area. An East Hampton Village official confirmed that all local beaches had been closed to foot traffic for safety reasons, including strong rip currents and storm surge waves. This incident follows previous scrutiny Blinken has faced regarding his leisure activities during significant national or international events.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the open ocean southeast of Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is moving north-northeast and is expected to strengthen slightly before weakening by Tuesday. With maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, Fernand is forecast to remain at sea and poses no direct threat to land, tracking well east of Bermuda. This storm follows Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength but also stayed offshore, though it caused dangerous coastal conditions along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>The French government has summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner following an open letter he published in the Wall Street Journal criticizing France's handling of antisemitic violence. In the letter, Kushner accused President Emmanuel Macron's government of not doing enough to enforce hate-crime laws and suggested that French criticism of Israel has fueled antisemitic incidents. France's foreign ministry called the ambassador's allegations "unacceptable" and scheduled a meeting. The diplomatic friction comes amid broader tensions between the U.S. and France over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and international recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed from his position as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), as confirmed by a senior defense official. The reason for his ousting was not provided to congressional intelligence committee leaders, prompting concern from some lawmakers about the administration's treatment of the intelligence community. Kruse's dismissal follows a DIA assessment of U.S. strikes on Iran that reportedly contradicted the administration's more optimistic public statements.

The cannabis industry argues the tax reduction is necessary for survival against a thriving illicit market, but the move would cut approximately $180 million in annual tax revenue. This revenue funds various state programs, including about $81 million designated for subsidized child-care slots for low-income families.

          <h2>Dangerous Heatwave Grips Western U.S., Fueling Multiple Wildfires</h2>

          <p>Millions of people across the Western United States are under extreme heat warnings as a dangerous heatwave brings triple-digit temperatures to parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. The National Weather Service warns of little nighttime relief from the heat, which increases the risk of heat-related illnesses. These hot and dry conditions are also elevating the risk of wildfires, contributing to the rapid spread of several active blazes. Among them are the Pickett Fire in California's Napa County and the Flat Fire in central Oregon, where firefighters are facing challenging weather conditions.</p>

          <p>An Ohio-based tiny living enthusiast has built what may be one of the world's smallest livable homes, measuring just 19.4 square feet, for a total cost of about $5,000. The project, constructed on an old utility trailer, took one month to complete and features a tilting bed, a compact kitchen with a mini-fridge, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower. The entire structure is powered by solar panels on the roof. The builder, Levi Kelly, documented the process to prove that a functional and creative living space can be created with minimal square footage.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a major overhaul of the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce processing times and decrease the number of migrants housed in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that while initial application decisions have been expedited, the appeals process faces "unacceptable delays," with an average wait time of over a year. The new plan involves establishing a body of independent adjudicators to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court-based system. The move comes amid increasing pressure and protests regarding the government's policy of using hotels to accommodate asylum seekers.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy executives are warning that the Trump administration's opposition to solar and wind projects could lead to a power shortage and increased electricity prices for consumers. Following the president's statement that his administration will not approve new solar or wind projects, industry leaders fear that blocking federal permits will stifle growth and destabilize the market. This policy, combined with tariffs on materials like copper and steel, is already raising project costs by up to 30%. Executives argue that choking off renewables will harm a stretched electric grid that is struggling to meet rising demand from new technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>A former writer and designer for Palantir Technologies has authored an opinion piece detailing the dangers of the company's AI-powered surveillance and targeting systems. The author describes how these tools, known as Istar systems, are used by agencies like ICE for immigration enforcement and by foreign militaries, creating "AI kill chains." The article argues that this technology enables mass surveillance that violates civil rights, such as the first and fourth amendments, by tracking people at scale without their knowledge or consent. The author calls for greater public awareness and regulation to counter the proliferation of these invisible and invasive systems.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has identified weak underlying growth and a shrinking workforce as acute challenges for the British economy. Speaking at a policy gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bailey noted a significant drop in labor force participation since the pandemic, driven by a rise in long-term sickness and fewer young people in work. He stated that this trend, combined with an aging population, increases the urgency of boosting economic productivity. The UK's labor market issues are a concern for policymakers as they may contribute to persistent inflation, which remains the highest in the G7.</p>
