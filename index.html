          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in fraudulent funds over the past year using a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of this sum, £186 million, was related to fraud committed during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the tool also identifying illegal council tax claims and social housing subletting. The Cabinet Office developed the "Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator" to scan new policies for weaknesses before implementation and now plans to license this technology to allies like the US and Australia. This development comes amid ongoing criticism from civil liberties groups regarding the government's use of AI, citing previous instances of algorithmic bias.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has addressed concerns over the company's staggering $850 billion plan for a 17-gigawatt AI infrastructure expansion, stating it is a necessary response to soaring demand. The project, in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, is equivalent to the power of 17 nuclear plants and has raised fears of a potential investment bubble. Altman acknowledged the worries but emphasized that such a massive supercomputing network is required to advance AI capabilities and meet the tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage over the past 18 months. He conceded that while some investors may get burned, the long-term societal value of the technology will be immense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his final regular-season start, Shohei Ohtani pitched a season-high six shutout innings, showcasing his readiness for his first career postseason pitching appearance. The two-way star was highly effective, striking out eight Arizona Diamondbacks batters and reaching a top fastball speed of 101.2 mph. Despite his dominant performance, the Dodgers' bullpen was unable to hold the 4-0 lead, ultimately surrendering five runs and losing the game 5-4. The team now faces a strategic decision on whether to start Ohtani in Game 1 of the upcoming wild-card series or save him for a potential later game.</p>

The return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" remains contentious, as major station owners Nexstar and Sinclair announced they would continue to preempt the show in their markets.</p>

          <p>Claudia Cardinale, an iconic figure of Italian and international cinema, has passed away at the age of 87 in Nemours, France. Born in Tunisia to Sicilian parents, Cardinale rose to fame in the 1960s and starred in over 100 films throughout her five-decade career. She is best remembered for her roles in classic films such as Federico Fellini's "8½," Luchino Visconti's "The Leopard," and Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West." Often mentioned alongside Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida as a titan of post-war Italian cinema, she received lifetime achievement awards from both the Venice and Berlin film festivals.</p>

          <p>A court in South Korea has sentenced Park Soon-kwan, the CEO of battery manufacturer Aricell, to 15 years in prison following a deadly fire at one of the company's plants. The June 2024 blaze in Hwaseong killed 23 people, the majority of whom were foreign workers, and was deemed an "anticipated disaster" by the court. The ruling represents the longest sentence ever imposed under the country's industrial safety law, which holds company owners accountable for fatal incidents. Investigators concluded that the firm lacked adequate safety measures and failed to properly train its workers on handling lithium battery fires.</p>

Under former mayor Geng Yanbo, the city widened its main waterway and reinforced its banks, a project initially criticized as wasteful but now praised for saving the city from severe flooding. This outcome is being highlighted as an example of the benefits of long-term investment in disaster resilience. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending not only improves urban safety but can also serve as a short-term economic stimulus, pointing to Beijing's recent issuance of sovereign debt for disaster prevention.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unfair dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. The Federal Court found that Lattouf was removed from her radio host position in December 2023 due to her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza. The court ruled that the ABC surrendered to an "orchestrated" campaign by pro-Israel lobby groups and that the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the broadcaster learned from its actions. The case has sparked national debate about the ABC's independence and its support for culturally diverse employees.</p>

Petro argued that if any of the victims were Colombian citizens, an investigation must include the senior official who gave the order, namely President Trump.

          <h2>Trump Reverses Stance, Now States Ukraine Can Win Back All Territory from Russia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 21:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form," including territory lost to Russia. This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a reversal from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would likely have to concede territory to end the war. Trump attributed his changed position to a new understanding of the military and economic situation, asserting that Russia's economy is in "BIG trouble." Zelensky hailed the reversal as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several U.S. citizens and one legal permanent resident have filed legal claims against the U.S. government, alleging they were wrongfully detained and racially profiled by federal immigration agents. One claimant, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen, was detained while pregnant and gave birth just days after her release. Another, a green card holder, claims he was beaten by officers despite having his legal documents with him. Their lawyer argues that agents are detaining people first and asking questions later, a concern amplified by a recent Supreme Court decision that immigration advocates warn could put more citizens at risk.</p>

          <p>The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust in the UK has been ordered to repay almost £5 million it received for meeting maternity safety standards that it did not actually achieve. The trust had self-reported compliance with all 10 safety measures under the Maternity Incentive Scheme, but a subsequent investigation by NHS Resolution found this to be inaccurate. The review was triggered by a damning report from the Care Quality Commission which rated the trust's maternity services as "inadequate." Families who experienced poor care are now calling for a full, independent inquiry into the trust's services.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Mexican national and former DACA recipient, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, has died while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

His death is the 14th to occur in immigration detention since January, a rising number that has prompted concern from Democratic senators. The Adelanto facility in particular has faced long-standing complaints from detainees and inspectors regarding inadequate medical care and unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products for the sixth time in a month due to potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. The latest recall involves three types of shrimp products from Seattle-based AquaStar, sold under the Kroger and AquaStar brands in 31 states. The investigation began after U.S. Customs and Border Protection detected the isotope in a shipment from an Indonesian company. While officials state that all products testing positive were denied entry, several voluntary recalls have since been issued as a precaution, though no illnesses have been reported.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of China's five-year plans, which have been a central pillar of the country's macroeconomic policy since 1953. Despite moving away from a command economy, these successive plans have guided China's transformation from a nation with limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory." The 14 plans implemented to date reflect over seven decades of policy shifts, starting with the initial focus on heavy industry in the 1950s. Beijing is now using this framework to pivot towards becoming a global innovation hub, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to be a crucial step in that process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is developing a plan to replace its aging C-17 Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy strategic airlifters with a single, next-generation platform. This new aircraft, part of the Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) program, is expected to enter service in the mid-2040s. According to the head of Air Mobility Command, the service is prioritizing greater speed, operational agility, and advanced defensive systems to counter growing threats in the air and on the ground. The goal is to procure one versatile aircraft type to fulfill the strategic airlift roles currently performed by two distinct fleets.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Ryan Routh guilty on all charges related to the attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in September 2024. Routh, who represented himself, was arrested at Trump's golf course after a Secret Service agent testified that Routh aimed a rifle at him before fleeing. Immediately after the guilty verdict was read, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before being subdued by U.S. marshals. This was the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024; he now faces a potential life sentence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's return to the United Nations rostrum marks a dramatic shift in his administration's approach to foreign policy, reflecting a more unapologetic "America First" doctrine. In a wide-ranging speech, he belittled climate change threats, touted his role as a peacemaker, and mocked the UN itself, prioritizing national sovereignty over global cooperation. This contrasts with his first term, where his approach was somewhat tempered by more traditional staff. Now, his administration's withdrawal from global agencies and transactional approach has left traditional allies scrambling to reorient their strategies in a world where U.S. leadership is no longer a given.</p>

          <p>A trial has begun in Athens concerning Greece's major spyware scandal, where the phones of ministers, military officers, and journalists were targeted with illegal surveillance software known as Predator. However, instead of government officials, the case focuses on four private individuals—two Israelis and two Greeks—facing misdemeanor charges related to marketing the software. The scandal, which broke in 2022, revealed that the National Intelligence Service (EYP), under the prime minister's direct supervision, had also monitored many of the same targets. Critics accuse the government of a cover-up and of failing to investigate potential connections between state officials and the illegal surveillance.</p>

          <p>Scottish pop icon Lulu, 76, has publicly revealed for the first time that she is a recovering alcoholic, a secret she kept for decades to protect her public image. In her new memoir, she details how she was a "highly functioning alcoholic," even while competing on the TV show "Strictly Come Dancing." The singer, now nearly 12 years sober, decided to share her story after opening up to her family on her 65th birthday, which led her to enter rehab. She attributes the origins of her secret struggles to a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father, and hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others and break a family pattern.</p>
