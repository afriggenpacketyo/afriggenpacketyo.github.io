          <p>Japan has strongly condemned North Korea's recent ballistic missile launches, stating that they pose a significant threat to regional peace and stability. The Japanese government views these actions as a violation of international norms and resolutions, and is closely monitoring the situation in coordination with its allies, including South Korea and the United States. Japan's defense minister has lodged a formal protest against North Korea, emphasizing the unacceptability of such provocative behavior.

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision that found the company in contempt for violating an order related to its case with Epic Games. The ruling requires Apple to allow developers to include external payment links in their apps without paying Apple's commission, which Apple claims could cost the company substantial sums, potentially in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars annually. Apple argues that the ruling punishes them and that developers are already exploiting the order to reduce consumer choice. Apple maintains it has complied with the court's order and plans to appeal the contempt ruling, with CEO Tim Cook stating the company strongly disagrees with the decision.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that the West is at an inflection point and the rise, fall and transformation of civilizations are often traced to the decisions of their leaders. It is posited that US President Donald Trump’s policies and rhetoric are accelerating the unravelling of the Western world order, echoing the mistakes of past rulers whose unwise actions led to irreversible decline. It suggests that the West is abandoning the concepts that once enforced Western hegemony and that Trump and his advisers are desperately trying to stay ahead of civilizational decline.</p>
