        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has abruptly terminated trade discussions with Canada, a move President Trump announced in response to Canada's impending digital services tax on large tech companies. The 3% tax, which primarily affects American firms, was labeled "egregious" by the president, who threatened to impose new tariffs on Canadian goods within a week. This development casts significant doubt on reaching a new trade agreement by the mid-July target, escalating economic tensions between the two closely linked partners. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that negotiations will continue despite the announcement.</p>

          <p>A game between the Miami Marlins and San Francisco Giants saw tensions escalate when the benches cleared in the seventh inning. The incident began after Giants first baseman Wilmer Flores argued a strikeout call, leading to a verbal confrontation with Marlins pitcher Cade Gibson. While no physical altercations occurred, the moment was charged, following a previous game where Giants batters were hit by pitches, leading to retaliation and an ejection. The Marlins ultimately won the game 12-5, completing a three-game sweep of the Giants.</p>

          <p>Irish singer-songwriter CMAT, speaking at the Glastonbury festival, revealed she continues to face severe online abuse after a song she wrote about being fat-shamed went viral. The artist, Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, explained that the harassment is so persistent she does not keep the TikTok app on her phone. Her song, "Take A Sexy Picture Of Me," was written in response to negative comments about her physical appearance at a festival last year. While she is glad the song resonates with many who have had similar experiences, she finds it sad that the theme is so relatable.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging over 40%. This growth is attributed to its recent inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news like the Senate's GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the market may not have fully priced in Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining crypto trading volumes, the overall sentiment is bullish, with many seeing Coinbase as a key way to invest in the growing utility of the crypto sector.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that the early July deadlines for reinstating high tariffs on goods from the European Union and other nations are not set in stone. When asked about the timeline, he stated, "we can do whatever we want," suggesting the deadlines could be extended or shortened. This contrasts with the executive order he signed, which established a 90-day pause on higher rates that is set to expire. Despite the administration's initial goal of securing numerous individual trade deals during this period, few have been finalized, creating uncertainty for global markets.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have elicited a wide range of reactions from foreign policy experts, revealing deep divisions on the path forward for Middle East stability. Some, like former National Security Adviser John Bolton, advocate for continued military pressure and ultimately regime change as the only solution for peace. Others, including former Iranian officials and Middle East scholars, argue the strikes were counterproductive, violated international law, and that direct U.S.-Iran negotiations are the only viable path. The analysis highlights conflicting perspectives on whether the attacks degraded Iran's capabilities or simply entrenched hostilities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues in favor of new congressional legislation aimed at prohibiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities during operations. The author contends that this practice undermines public trust, creates safety risks by making it hard to distinguish officers from impostors, and erodes law enforcement legitimacy. Citing incidents across the country, the piece emphasizes that transparency and accountability are fundamental to policing in a democracy. The author concludes that allowing agents to operate anonymously is unacceptable and evokes images of authoritarian secret police.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 that a Maryland school district must allow parents to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving books with LGBTQ+ themes. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that forcing participation in lessons that contradict families' religious beliefs imposes a substantial burden on their religious freedom. In dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the decision could lead to "chaos" for public schools and create administrative burdens.

While experienced professionals in complex fields like law and medicine are less threatened, the unemployment rate for young graduates is already rising.

This decision is a significant victory for the administration, as it curtails a tool frequently used to halt executive actions.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a defamation lawsuit against Fox News, seeking at least $787 million in damages. The suit alleges that the network, and specifically anchor Jesse Watters, knowingly made false statements by claiming Newsom had lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. Newsom's legal team states the governor is willing to drop the suit if Fox News retracts the claim and issues an on-air apology. Fox News has responded by calling the lawsuit a "frivolous publicity stunt" designed to chill free speech, and stated it will defend the case vigorously.</p>

As a self-sustaining artist who handles everything from her album art to video direction, she embraces a "scrappy as hell" punk ethos.

The ruling, in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, affirmed that the health secretary has direct oversight of an expert panel that recommends preventive services under the Affordable Care Act. While upholding a key part of the law, experts warn this gives Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. complete power to shape recommendations.
