          <p>Investors are showing a preference for shorter-term Treasury investments, driven by concerns about economic volatility and the relative stability of short-term yields. The 3-month T-Bill is currently offering an annualized yield above 4.3%, making it an attractive option compared to longer-term bonds. ETF flows indicate a strong interest in ultrashort Treasury bond ETFs, with the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) attracting significant investor capital. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has also increased its holdings of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential runoff election between Rafal Trzaskowski, a pro-European liberal, and Karol Nawrocki, a staunch nationalist. Trzaskowski, backed by the Civic Coalition party, aims to soften Poland's abortion ban and protect LGBTQ rights, potentially enabling Prime Minister Donald Tusk's reformist agenda. Nawrocki, endorsed by outgoing President Andrzej Duda, champions traditional Polish values and is skeptical of the EU, which could bolster the opposition Law and Justice party. With polls indicating a tight race, the outcome will significantly impact Poland's political direction, particularly regarding European integration and social policies.</p>

          <p>Emma Beddington examines the gendered dynamics in work-from-home arrangements, drawing on observations and research indicating that men often disproportionately claim dedicated workspaces. She references personal anecdotes and literary examples to illustrate how women's work can be subtly sidelined within domestic spaces. Beddington connects these dynamics to broader structural inequalities, including the gender pay gap. She argues for greater recognition of women's work and equitable access to domestic space.</p>
