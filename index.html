          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Newsmax's antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, labeling the filing an impermissible "shotgun complaint" for improperly incorporating all allegations into each successive count. The judge, Aileen Cannon, has granted Newsmax an opportunity to submit a revised, properly structured complaint by the following week. Newsmax's lawsuit accuses Fox News of monopolistic practices and intimidation tactics to suppress competition in the conservative media market. Fox News has dismissed the allegations as an attempt by Newsmax to compensate for its own competitive failures in the marketplace.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has become a primary target of Russian state-sponsored propaganda and personal attacks, which experts attribute to her strong support for Ukraine and her influential position. Following a suspected GPS sabotage of her plane, Russian media amplified mockery and defamatory narratives, often using sexist and belittling language to undermine her credibility. Analysts suggest the Kremlin's strategy aims to weaken and divide the European Union by discrediting its leadership. The campaign is seen as part of a broader information war against Western institutions that oppose Russia's actions in Ukraine.</p>

The famed yellow-and-white streetcar, popular with both locals and tourists, derailed and collided with a building, resulting in significant loss of life. Among the deceased were four employees of the Santa Casa da Misericordia Catholic charity, remembered for their benevolent work. As multiple agencies investigate the cause of the accident, the community has gathered to grieve and call for swift answers to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>An off-duty pilot accused of trying to shut down the engines of an Alaska Airlines flight in 2023 has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in both federal and state courts. The pilot, Joseph Emerson, reportedly told authorities he was suffering from depression and lack of sleep and had recently consumed psychedelic mushrooms, believing he was in a dream. The flight was safely diverted, and no one was injured. The plea agreement aims to ensure Emerson takes responsibility for his actions while potentially avoiding additional prison time, renewing focus on mental health protocols for airline personnel.</p>

Deputies found that Bucur had run an extension cord through a vent to power his makeshift living quarters. He was arrested after deputies also found a pipe with methamphetamine residue, adding another chapter to his history of criminal charges in California.</p>

          <p>Divers and archaeologists have recovered significant ruins and relics from a 2,000-year-old city submerged in Abu Qir Bay, near Alexandria, Egypt. The artifacts, which date from the Ptolemaic to the Roman eras, include pottery, statues, and ancient port structures. Officials believe the site was an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, known in antiquity as a center for religious festivals and entertainment. The discovery provides new insights into the region's prosperity and highlights how natural events like earthquakes have shaped history by submerging once-thriving urban centers.</p>

The slowdown, particularly in federal employment and manufacturing, is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by trade tariffs.

The ruling noted that the business owner also used her computer for personal matters. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by a desire to remove the employee before she reached two years of service, which grants stronger unfair dismissal protections.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached the U.S. Open final, where she will compete against world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka. Anisimova's path to the final marks a remarkable comeback after a difficult period, including a devastating 6-0, 6-0 loss in the Wimbledon final. Her performance in New York has showcased significant mental improvements and devastating offensive shotmaking, with key victories over top players. She now faces the ultimate test against Sabalenka, a three-time major champion who has been dominant on hard courts but has shown vulnerability under pressure in past finals.</p>

          <h2>Putin Warns Western Troops in Ukraine Would Be 'Legitimate Targets,' Rejecting Post-Ceasefire Security Force</h2>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has forcefully rejected a Western proposal to deploy an international "reassurance force" to Ukraine following a potential ceasefire. He warned that any foreign troops sent to Ukraine would be considered "legitimate targets" by Russia. The proposal, championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, involves a coalition of allies providing security guarantees to prevent future aggression. Putin's statement dismisses the initiative and signals a hardening stance against any Western military presence in the region, further complicating efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Shares of Broadcom surged after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and provided a significantly improved revenue forecast for its artificial intelligence sector in fiscal year 2026. CEO Hock Tan announced that Broadcom has secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, widely believed to be OpenAI, with over $10 billion in new orders. This unexpected development suggests that Wall Street's previous earnings estimates were too low, making the stock appear cheaper on a forward-looking basis despite its record-high price. The positive outlook is further bolstered by Tan's agreement to remain CEO through at least 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has appointed David Lammy as his new deputy prime minister. The change is part of a broader cabinet reshuffle affecting several key government roles.

Starmer's new appointments aim to stabilize his government and fill the leadership vacuum left by Rayner's departure, signaling a new phase for his administration.</p>

          <p>In one of the largest single-site enforcement actions in Homeland Security Investigations history, federal agents detained 475 workers at a Hyundai facility under construction in Georgia. The raid was part of a monthslong investigation into unlawful employment practices, targeting individuals who allegedly entered the U.S. illegally or violated visa terms by working. The majority of those detained were Korean nationals. The operation has halted construction at the new battery plant, a massive economic project for the state, and has drawn criticism from labor unions who called the raid a politically motivated act of harassment.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell by 16 basis points to 6.29%, marking its largest one-day drop since August 2024 and reaching its lowest point since October. The sharp decline was a direct reaction to the weaker-than-expected August jobs report, which has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This significant drop in borrowing costs could provide some relief to potential homebuyers who have been sidelined by high home prices and months of rates hovering near 7%. However, it remains uncertain if this will be enough to reinvigorate a housing market that has been struggling with affordability issues. (not investment advice)</p>

An initial legal challenge to block the law was unsuccessful, and an appeal court will not hear arguments until November, meaning no relief is expected for months. The Texas law is one of many similar bills being considered or passed in states across the U.S., reflecting growing political tensions with China.
