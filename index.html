          <p>Federal immigration authorities conducted multiple enforcement operations across Los Angeles, leading to the arrest of dozens of individuals and sparking citywide protests. The raids, involving Homeland Security Investigations, the DEA, and the FBI, took place in areas such as the Westlake District, downtown L.A., and South L.A. According to ICE spokesperson Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe, approximately 44 people were arrested, prompting condemnation from community leaders, activists, and local politicians. Mayor Karen Bass and Senator Alex Padilla criticized the operations, while community organizers rallied against what they described as terrorizing tactics that disrupt the safety of immigrant communities. The situation remains tense as investigations continue and legal representatives provide support to those detained. Optimism is low due to the disruption and fear instilled in the community.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges. The indictment, filed in Nashville, accuses Abrego Garcia of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that the charges are an abuse of power and that his client is not the leader of an international smuggling conspiracy. The legal proceedings and Abrego Garcia's treatment while detained in El Salvador remain contentious issues.</p>

          <p>The phone call between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping has provided a temporary respite for Asian countries caught in the middle of the U.S.-China trade rivalry. The conversation, described as "very positive" by Trump, signals a potential easing of tensions after weeks of escalating hostility. For many of China's neighbors that rely on trade with both powers, this detente offers a chance to avoid choosing between prioritizing trade with China and navigating aggressive U.S. policies. However, analysts caution that the relationship between the two superpowers remains fragile and could still present challenges for the region.</p>

          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old from Georgia, helped his coworkers at Burger King on his graduation night and was rewarded with significant donations. Baker, known for his strong work ethic, stepped in to assist his colleagues despite having the night off. A customer, Maria Mendoza, captured the act on video and started a crowdfunding campaign, which has raised over $200,000. Baker plans to use the money to attend trade school and become a master auto mechanic. The Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker and Mendoza with $10,000 each, showing the positive impact of his actions.</p>

The feasibility of starting a new party is questionable, given ballot access challenges and campaign finance regulations.
