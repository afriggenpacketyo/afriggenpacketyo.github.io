          <p>Bitcoin is rebounding, climbing for a third consecutive day amidst a broader market recovery fueled by President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and less confrontational rhetoric towards the Federal Reserve. The cryptocurrency reached a high of $94,499.86, marking its strongest level since early March, and has recovered approximately half of its losses since Inauguration Day. Market strategists suggest this surge is driven by investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset viewed as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and U.S. dollar volatility.

          <p>The protracted bin strike in Birmingham may be drawing to a close as the Unite union has agreed to mediation talks with Acas. The strike, which began on March 11 over plans to downgrade refuse workers' pay, has resulted in significant waste accumulation and public health concerns, prompting the declaration of a major incident. While the union has accused the city council of inconsistent messaging, both parties have expressed a willingness to negotiate, with talks scheduled for May 1 and 2. The dispute initially centered on the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officer roles, but now also involves concerns over bin lorry drivers' pay.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term has been marked by aggressive trade policies, including substantial tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, which have strained relationships with traditionally close partners. This shift in US foreign policy is creating opportunities for China to strengthen its position on the global stage, particularly in Europe where leaders are questioning the strength of the transatlantic alliance. As the US imposes tariffs on goods from various nations, China could benefit from the resulting trade disruptions and weakened alliances, potentially reshaping the geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the U.S. and China have an opportunity to reach a significant trade agreement, advocating for a collaborative approach to rebalancing economic relations. Bessent suggested that a "beautiful rebalancing" could occur if both nations work together, referencing Ray Dalio's concerns about Trump's tariff policies potentially leading to an economic downturn. The Trump administration is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on China from 145% to between 50% and 65%, signaling a potential shift in trade strategy. Bessent also outlined a plan to reform the World Bank and IMF, urging them to stop lending to economically advanced nations like China.</p>

One tenant claims to have contracted Legionnaires' disease before being notified of the contamination and had to fight to get the results of her own apartment's water tests.

The victim, identified as Barak Tzach, entered the water with snorkeling gear and an underwater camera to document sharks that frequent the area. Despite warnings from conservation groups, the area has attracted large crowds who have been observed interacting with the sharks, prompting authorities to ban swimming at the beach. This is only the third recorded shark attack in Israel, raising concerns about human interaction with these marine predators.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a 5% increase after CEO Elon Musk indicated he would dedicate more time to the company and President Trump signaled potential tariff reductions on China. This boost occurred despite Tesla reporting lackluster first-quarter results, including a significant drop in automotive revenue and net income. Musk also mentioned that he would be scaling back his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency, suggesting a renewed focus on Tesla. The market's positive reaction suggests investor optimism regarding potential improvements in Tesla's performance and the easing of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that China has stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to the ongoing trade war and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Some 737 Max planes destined for Chinese airlines have been returned to the U.S., and Boeing is considering reallocating aircraft intended for China to other customers. Ortberg emphasized that this situation will not derail the company's recovery, as there is strong demand for the Max aircraft from other customers.

          <p>Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine are intensifying, with talks occurring in London and a U.S. envoy heading to Moscow for further discussions with President Putin. However, the path to a resolution remains unclear, as Russia continues to insist on specific conditions being met before any ceasefire. A proposed framework involves Russia halting its invasion along current lines and relinquishing ambitions to control certain regions, in exchange for the U.S. accepting de facto Russian control of occupied territories and Ukraine ruling out NATO membership. The proposal faces significant obstacles, including Ukraine's refusal to concede Crimea's sovereignty to Russia.</p>

Led by figures like Malcolm and Simone Collins, the movement promotes a cultural shift that enforces right-wing social values and limits women's roles in society. While advocating for policies like fertility awareness classes and baby bonuses, the movement notably neglects crucial needs of actual mothers, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare, revealing its focus on encouraging births primarily among white populations and reinforcing traditional gender roles.</p>
