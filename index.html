          <p>UFC CEO Dana White expressed his shock and sorrow over the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, an event he described as difficult to comprehend. He noted the profound impact the killing had on his own children, who followed Kirk on social media, and extended his sympathies to Kirk's family. White emphasized his hope for a return to normalcy and unity within the country, urging an end to infighting and finger-pointing in the wake of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A 45-year-old Argentinian hiker, Matias Augusto Travizano, died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down Wintun Glacier on Mount Shasta. After successfully reaching the summit, he and another hiker lost the trail during their descent and attempted a controlled slide on an ice sheet, which resulted in the fatal accident. Authorities noted this was the second death on the same trail in a month, highlighting the dangers of the mountain despite its reputation as a relatively easy climb. Officials stress the importance of proper navigation tools and preparedness for changing weather conditions.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has expressed serious concern that Parliament is vulnerable to foreign espionage. His warning follows the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to drop charges against two men accused of spying for China, citing insufficient evidence. Sir Lindsay stated he was "a very unhappy speaker" over the decision and believes it "leaves the door open" for foreign actors to spy on the House. The Home Office also criticized the move, calling it disappointing given the gravity of the allegations.</p>

The resignation follows a referral from a Trump ally to prosecute James for alleged mortgage fraud, a case prosecutors reportedly felt lacked sufficient evidence to proceed with.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats toward ABC over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel, comparing the pressure to "mafioso" tactics. While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was suspended for his monologue about Charlie Kirk's assassination, Cruz warned that the government threatening a network's broadcast license is "dangerous as hell." He argued that such actions set a perilous precedent for free speech that could ultimately harm conservatives. President Trump publicly disagreed with Cruz's assessment, defending the FCC chairman's actions.</p>

          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that weakening ties between the United States and India, coupled with waning U.S. interest in regional frameworks, are creating strategic openings for China in Asia. The researcher highlighted the importance of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which includes Japan, Australia, India, and the U.S., as a key tool for balancing against China. President Trump's decision not to attend a recent Quad summit in New Delhi is seen from a Japanese perspective as a potentially dangerous development for regional stability.</p>

As Walmart rapidly expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, its seller vetting processes allegedly became more lax, allowing bad actors to impersonate legitimate businesses and sell fake goods. The report found that shoppers have received potentially dangerous counterfeit items, such as supplements and beauty products, sold by sellers using the stolen identities of real companies. In response, Walmart has stated it has a zero-tolerance policy and is investing in new tools to combat deceptive behavior.</p>

          <p>Recent threats from the Trump administration to revoke television networks' broadcast licenses have raised questions about the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) actual powers. The FCC, an independent agency, is responsible for issuing licenses to local TV and radio stations, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels, it can effectively block corporate mergers by denying the transfer of licenses. Experts note that while the FCC has significant leeway, revoking a license is a complex process and would likely face major legal challenges based on First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Remnants of Tropical Storm Mario have caused severe rain and mudslides in San Bernardino Mountain communities like Forest Falls, trapping residents and causing significant damage. The debris flows, exacerbated by recent wildfire burn scars, have buried roads, submerged vehicles, and damaged homes, with at least one resident barely escaping as mud surged through his house. Power outages and leaking propane tanks have added to the hazardous conditions, isolating the small mountain towns. Rescue efforts are underway, with reports of pets being found alive after being lost in the destruction.</p>

          <p>Supermodel David Gandy has voiced concerns that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to the modeling and fashion photography industry. He is part of a group of over 2,000 models calling on the government for regulation to protect people's likenesses from being used by generative AI. Gandy fears that AI-generated models could make human models, photographers, makeup artists, and others redundant, damaging the creative industry. He also worries about the mental health impact of young people being exposed to AI-generated images of people who do not exist.</p>

          <p>Evans Kibet, a 36-year-old Kenyan long-distance runner, has appeared in a video released by the Ukrainian army claiming he was tricked into joining the Russian military. Now a prisoner of war, Kibet says he went to Russia for a running event but was coerced into signing military papers he couldn't read and then sent to a training camp. He insists he never fought, escaping at the first opportunity before surrendering to Ukrainian soldiers. His family in Kenya is in shock and is pleading with the Kenyan government to help secure his return home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia is reviving the Soviet-era "Intervision" song contest, a move seen as creating an alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The contest, backed by the Kremlin, features 23 participating countries, including allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, reflecting Russia's current geopolitical alliances. While officials frame it as a cultural initiative, critics view it as a political project to demonstrate that Russia still has international friends. The event emphasizes traditional culture over the kitsch often associated with Eurovision.</p>

          <p>A series of major investment announcements from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google during President Trump's state visit has highlighted a surge of optimism in the UK's technology and AI potential. Nvidia's CEO declared the UK will be an "AI superpower," while Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment to expand its AI infrastructure in the country. This influx of capital is seen as a plan to sprinkle "Silicon Valley stardust" on the UK's research hubs, potentially defining the nation's economy for decades, though it also raises questions about economic dependency.

          <p>Actor Cillian Murphy, reflecting on his role as Tommy Shelby, has emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for nearly a decade in "Peaky Blinders." He described the opportunity to grow with a character over six series as a defining "gift and a privilege." While promoting his new film "Steve," Murphy confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" movie is forthcoming from Netflix, but stated the plot remains a closely guarded secret. He attributes the show's massive success to its writing and its arrival at a specific moment in time.</p>

          <p>Clashes broke out at an ICE facility in Chicago as federal agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse around 100 demonstrators. The protesters, including two Democratic congressional candidates, were attempting to block vehicles during "Operation Midway Blitz," an immigration crackdown in the city. At least three people were arrested during the confrontation, which saw masked homeland security agents in riot gear deploy crowd control measures. The protest was fueled by anger over the recent fatal shooting of a man by an immigration officer in the Chicago area.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. vaccine advisory committee, the ACIP, has voted to stop its broad recommendation for all adults to receive an annual Covid-19 vaccine. Instead, the panel now advises that individuals should make the decision in consultation with a healthcare provider. The committee, whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was split on whether a prescription should be required. This policy shift moves away from the universal guidance that has been in place since the pandemic and could create varied access to the vaccine across different states.</p>
