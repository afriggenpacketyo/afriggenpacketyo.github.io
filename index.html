          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges by 2030 Amid Record Pollution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 03:02:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to cutting sewage discharges from water companies in half by the year 2030. This new target follows public anger over record-high pollution incidents in 2024 and widespread scrutiny of the water industry's performance and executive bonuses. The pledge is part of a broader government plan to reform the water sector, which also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution to protect wildlife. These reforms come as consumers face significant increases in their water bills to fund a £104 billion investment in infrastructure over the next five years.</p>

          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall across South Korea have led to a significant loss of life, with authorities reporting at least 14 people dead and 12 others missing. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, primarily affecting southern and central regions of the country. In response to the disaster, approximately 3,840 people have been evacuated from their homes for safety. While the rain has now subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the country is dealing with the devastating aftermath of the extreme downpours.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao made his return to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw. The 46-year-old Filipino icon showed flashes of his former speed but ultimately could not secure a victory, with one judge scoring for Barrios and two scoring it even. Despite the result, Pacquiao expressed that he believed he won the close and tough fight and is open to a rematch. The bout highlighted both Pacquiao's enduring skill and the challenge of competing at an elite level after a long hiatus from the sport.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after recent devastating floods, lowering the count from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to the diligent work of state and local agencies who successfully verified the safety of many people initially reported as unaccounted for. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, which was severely impacted by the flooding event earlier in the month. The statewide death toll from the floods stands at 134, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" report details the strange case of Linda Duffey Gwozdz, who was convicted of murdering her husband, Patrick Duffey, in 2007. Gwozdz claimed the shooting was a tragic accident, stemming from a goofy game where the couple mimicked cartoon characters. She alleged her husband used an Elmer Fudd voice to say "No more buwwets," leading her to believe the gun was unloaded before she accidentally shot him twice while attempting a "cowboy style" fan-firing technique. After an initial mistrial, prosecutors secured a second-degree murder conviction in a retrial by simplifying their case and focusing on forensic evidence that contradicted her story.</p>

Investigators then used Google Dashboard location data from another man's phone, George Steven Burch, to place him at the crime scene. This case highlights the growing importance of data from personal electronic devices in criminal investigations, capable of both implicating suspects and clearing the innocent.</p>

          <p>In a recent analysis, Simon Tisdall argues that the relentless nature of modern conflicts, such as those in Gaza and Ukraine, stems from more than just political failure. He posits that a breakdown of a "permanent moral order" and the rise of moral relativism have made peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. This moral fracturing means there is no universally accepted standard to judge actions, allowing atrocities to be justified by different groups and public arguments to polarize indefinitely. Tisdall suggests this retreat into subjective morality, where social identity can trump conscience, is a key reason why violence and suffering are allowed to continue unabated.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated the US Eagles in a decisive 33-5 victory during a weather-disrupted match in Washington D.C. The game was marked by extreme humidity and two lengthy delays due to lightning, but the English side maintained its composure and precision. England's young squad scored six tries, showcasing their professional depth against a less experienced American team. The match was part of an effort by World Rugby to build audiences and invest in the sport in the United States ahead of the country hosting future World Cup events.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game made a collective statement regarding their ongoing labor negotiations by wearing warmup shirts that read, "Pay us what you owe us." The demonstration comes after the players and the league failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in a recent meeting. The WNBA Players Association opted out of their last CBA in search of a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. The public protest highlights the significant gap between what the players are seeking and what the league has offered, with some players mentioning a potential walkout if a deal isn't reached.</p>
