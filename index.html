          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the complex dynamics surrounding potential ceasefire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Moscow believes it holds a battlefield advantage and is therefore posturing aggressively in diplomatic discussions. Washington, however, views Russia's gains as costly and incremental, making their negotiating position unrealistic. The article highlights the challenges the Trump administration faces in convincing Putin that improved relations with the U.S. outweigh the benefits of continued conflict, while Russia anticipates a collapse of Ukrainian defenses and a shift in Kyiv's leadership. This article suggests that any immediate progress in peace talks is unlikely, as both sides are entrenched in their positions and calculations. </p>

          <p>Serbian students completed a nearly 2,000 km ultramarathon from Novi Sad to Brussels to protest pro-democracy and anti-corruption issues, aiming to bring their concerns to European officials. The students seek understanding and support from the European Union for their ongoing fight against authoritarianism and corruption in Serbia. European lawmakers welcomed the students, acknowledging the issues raised in the EU's latest Progress Report on Serbia. Due to Serbia's failure to meet obligations outlined in the Growth Plan, the EU has postponed the disbursement of €111 million in aid, increasing pressure on the Serbian government to act on EU integration. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration implemented new tariffs on goods worth less than $800 arriving in the United States from China and Hong Kong, effectively closing a tax loophole. Initially set at 120% or a $100 flat fee, the tariff is now 54% following a temporary truce in trade tensions. The de minimis exemption had allowed millions of inexpensive Chinese packages to enter the U.S. duty-free, angering American businesses. The new tariffs are expected to increase costs for shoppers and disrupt global trade, leading to fewer orders for Chinese factories and potential business closures. </p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney expressed that Canadians were not "impressed" by the UK government's invitation to US President Donald Trump for a second state visit. Carney stated that the invitation did not help Canadians, who were facing repeated comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. He emphasized that his invitation for King Charles III to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament was a reaffirming moment for Canadian sovereignty. Since returning to the White House, Trump has made comments undermining Canada's sovereignty, including that the Canadian border is an "artificially drawn line". </p>

          <p>A new Republican tax bill threatens to exclude millions of families from the child tax credit, even as conservatives advocate for policies designed to incentivize having more children. The bill seeks to raise the child tax credit to $2,500 per child, but an estimated 17 million children would be ineligible to receive the full credit due to their parents' income. The bill would also require a social security number for both parents to claim the credit, making undocumented immigrants and other immigrants without work authorization ineligible. The debate arrives amid a surging right-wing interest in pronatalism, with Republicans reportedly entertaining proposals such as offering families a $5,000 “baby bonus”. </p>

The obituary details Souter's background, his appointment by George H.W. Bush, and his judicial philosophy rooted in legal positivism and respect for precedent.

          <p>A federal appeals panel has restricted the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in seven states, ruling that private individuals and groups cannot sue under Section 1983 to enforce Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the election process.

The decision is seen as a prelude to a potential showdown at the Supreme Court, where previous rulings have eroded the law's protections.

The proposal comes after farmers across the European Union staged protests over issues including EU regulations and cheap imports. The changes could save farmers up to €1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying subsidies to environmental regulations, and certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental regulations. </p>
