          <p>The late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has been suspended indefinitely by its network, ABC, following controversial comments made by the host. The decision came after media giant Nexstar announced it would also stop airing the show, labeling Jimmy Kimmel's remarks about the recent shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as "offensive and insensitive." This suspension removes a long-standing staple from the network's lineup, reflecting the intense political sensitivities surrounding the event. The network provided no timeline for the show's potential return.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel fell approximately 10% in after-hours trading following a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report and a weak forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Julie Masino addressed the recent intense customer backlash against an attempted corporate rebrand, which involved changing the company's iconic logo. Acknowledging the public's passion for the brand's traditional identity, the company has completely reversed the rebranding and is refocusing on kitchen innovation and enhancing the guest experience.

The event was attended by prominent figures, including tech CEOs and Rupert Murdoch, signaling the visit's focus on strengthening economic ties. While the day was marked by royal pageantry, thousands of protesters gathered in London to voice their opposition to the visit. The trip is seen as a key diplomatic effort by Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government to secure investment and political favor.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, CNBC's Jim Cramer cautioned investors against making significant portfolio changes based solely on the move. He argued that the cut was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter major market themes, suggesting that any resulting market volatility might even present buying opportunities. Cramer noted that the Fed faces a difficult challenge in balancing persistent inflation with a slowing labor market, calling Chair Jerome Powell's steady approach exactly what was needed.

          <p>Authorities have arrested a 20-year-old man for allegedly making a threat of terrorism against Utah Valley University, the campus where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated one week prior. The suspect, Blake Francis Rogers, allegedly posted a video online detailing an "odyssey" to the university to "kill woke." Rogers reportedly told investigators the video was a "joke" sent to a small group of people. The arrest came as students returned to the grieving campus, which has become a site of collective mourning.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, one of the co-founders of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the ice cream company, citing an ongoing conflict with its parent company, Unilever. In a public letter, Greenfield accused Unilever of silencing the brand's well-known progressive social mission and activism. The resignation marks an escalation in a years-long struggle over the brand's independence, which was intended to be protected by a special board established when Unilever acquired the company in 2000. Greenfield stated the brand was being sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that Democrats will "lose that battle" if they insist on including an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies in a bill to fund the government. With a September 30 deadline looming, Johnson accused Democrats of risking a shutdown by inserting "partisan political preferences" into a necessary funding measure. Democrats argue the enhanced tax credits are essential to prevent a massive increase in health insurance premiums for millions of Americans, setting the stage for a high-stakes fiscal showdown.</p>

The lackluster debut occurred despite a recent resurgence in the live events market, which has benefited from high-profile tours and sporting events.

          <p>This article offers a critical analysis of Donald Trump's U.K. state visit, questioning the value of the immense effort and expense involved in the carefully orchestrated royal welcome. The author compares the event to "The Truman Show," noting how the president was shielded within Windsor Castle from public view and potential protesters. The piece speculates on whether this display of pageantry will translate into tangible diplomatic or economic gains for Britain, such as trade concessions or moderated geopolitical stances, with the true results yet to be seen.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a directive to the National Park Service, instructing it to review and alter exhibits that are perceived to "inappropriately disparage" historical figures. A primary example cited is the presentation at George Washington's presidential home in Philadelphia, which details his ownership of slaves. This move is part of a broader administration effort to reshape the narrative of American history presented at national parks and monuments, a policy that has drawn criticism for potentially censoring or sanitizing historical facts.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Ferguson, a former Orange County Superior Court judge, has been sentenced to 35 years to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Sheryl. The 74-year-old was convicted in April of fatally shooting his wife during what prosecutors described as a "drunken argument" over money at their home. Shortly after the shooting, Ferguson texted his court staff, admitting, "I just lost it. I just shot my wife." The couple's son witnessed the event and attempted to perform CPR on his mother before she died.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators marched through central London to protest the second state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, a group of over 50 organizations, the rally featured signs with slogans such as "no to racism, no to Trump." The protest was a visible display of public opposition to the visit, even as the president himself was largely kept within the confines of Windsor Castle for official ceremonies with the royal family. The Metropolitan Police estimated that up to 5,000 people attended the demonstration.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once signed mortgage documents that simultaneously designated two separate properties as his "principal residence." This claim is strikingly similar to the allegations of mortgage fraud that President Donald Trump cited in his unsuccessful attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Bessent himself had previously commented that such allegations against a Fed official should be examined, creating a potentially hypocritical situation and highlighting the political maneuvering within Washington's financial leadership.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Tax Policies Create Complex Loopholes for Specific Groups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:23:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes recent Republican tax legislation, arguing that it creates a more complex and inequitable system by introducing targeted loopholes for both the wealthy and specific working-class groups. Provisions like the pass-through deduction for business owners and new tax exemptions for tips and overtime create what economists call "horizontal inequity," where households with similar incomes pay vastly different amounts in taxes. The author suggests this approach erodes the tax base, potentially leaving salaried middle-class professionals to bear a disproportionate burden. (not investment advice)</p>
