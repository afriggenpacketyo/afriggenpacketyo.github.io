            <h2>Harvard University Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Threats</h2>

            <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration in response to threats of withheld federal funding if the university doesn't comply with a series of demands. University President Alan Garber announced the lawsuit, asserting that the administration's actions are unlawful and exceed governmental authority. The lawsuit is a response to the administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in funding and threats to freeze an additional $1 billion, initiate investigations, and potentially revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, which the university claims would negatively impact patients, students, faculty, and American higher education. The administration's demands are viewed as unprecedented and an improper attempt to control the university.</p>

            <p>The U.S. military stationed in the New Mexico National Defense Area has been authorized to temporarily detain and search illegal migrants, marking a more active law enforcement role for the military. Service members with the Joint Task Force-Southern Border can now conduct security measures, including providing medical care and implementing crowd control, until law enforcement takes custody. The move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to curb illegal immigration, with the military assisting in installing barriers and conducting patrols in the area. This action follows the transfer of nearly 110,000 acres of federal land to the Army to support Border Patrol operations.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been found guilty in her federal bribery trial, mirroring her husband's previous conviction on similar charges. Prosecutors argued that the couple acted as "partners in crime," accepting cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for political favors. She was found guilty of accepting bribes in exchange for her husband's actions to benefit Egypt, according to federal prosecutors. Bob Menendez was previously sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes from New Jersey businessmen, and Nadine Menendez faces a potential sentence of up to 20 years for some of the charges against her.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The university argues that these actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers, and the standing of American higher education in the world. The suit claims the administration is seeking billions of dollars in cuts of federal grants and contracts from Harvard.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to use active-duty military personnel for law enforcement duties at the US southern border. This law allows the president to deploy troops if they determine that "unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion" make it "impracticable to enforce" US law through normal judicial processes. Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low, but the statute could further expand the president's powers. The Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history, including by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.</p>

The information shared included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the attack. This follows reports that Hegseth inadvertently shared details about the March 15 missile strike in Yemen with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

            <p>With credit card debt at record highs and interest rates hovering near 22%, consolidating debt into a lower-rate loan can be beneficial. Consolidating can lead to significant savings over time, particularly with a personal loan at an average rate of 12%. However, the effectiveness depends on credit profile; those with good to excellent credit may qualify for the lowest consolidation loan rates. Assessing one's financial situation, understanding debt scope, checking credit score, comparing loan offers, and evaluating financial habits are essential before pursuing debt consolidation.

            <p>Tesla shares fell almost 6% ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report, as analysts express concerns about "ongoing brand erosion." CEO Elon Musk's involvement within the Trump administration and distractions outside of Tesla are in focus, along with the company's progress on robotaxi and self-driving technology. Musk's politics and antics have elicited a backlash in Europe and parts of the U.S., leading to protests, boycotts, and criminal activity targeting Tesla vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 13% decline in vehicle deliveries compared to the same period last year. (not investment advice)</p>

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell as low as 97.92, the lowest level since March 2022. This has been spurred by Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy, which comes as his own plans for tariffs have raised fears of economic recession. (not investment advice)</p>
