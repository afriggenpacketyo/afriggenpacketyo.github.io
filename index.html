          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending GPU designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls, clarifying that no designs will be modified in China to comply with these restrictions. A spokesperson for Nvidia stated that the company is not sending any GPU designs to China for modification. This announcement follows a report by the Financial Times, which suggested that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed establishing a research and development center in Shanghai to cater to the local market while adhering to U.S. regulations. Production and design will continue outside of China.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday due to disagreements over pay raises, effectively shutting down train service and impacting over 300,000 daily commuters. The union claims engineers haven't received a pay raise in five years, while NJ Transit maintains its offer was fair and fiscally responsible. NJ Transit has implemented a contingency plan, including additional bus service on select routes, but warns it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate the impact, and commuters are advised to consider alternative transportation options.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and the cost of achieving a basic standard of living is widening, particularly for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for many, as their average earnings of $38,000 per year fall short of the $67,000 needed to afford essential items. Rising costs of housing, healthcare, and education contribute to this economic distress, with the nation's official unemployment rate understating the true level of economic hardship.</p>

Rapid growth in data centers and increased use of electric vehicles are driving electricity demand, straining utilities and leading to rising rates.
