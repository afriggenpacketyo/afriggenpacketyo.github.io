          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:45:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US State Department has controversially removed its online portal, the Human Rights Reporting Gateway, which facilitated public reporting of alleged abuses by foreign military units receiving American weapons. This decision has sparked widespread condemnation from human rights campaigners and a congressional aide, who assert it constitutes a clear disregard for the law mandating such information gathering. Critics argue that the move is part of a broader State Department reorganization under the Trump administration, which has reduced human rights monitoring in favor of an "America First" foreign policy. The department, however, insists it continues to receive reports and adheres to its legal obligations, despite fears that this action significantly weakens oversight and accountability for international human rights violations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:39:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant jump of approximately 3% following the Trump administration's decision to impose further sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these measures were taken due to Moscow's perceived lack of serious commitment to ending the war in Ukraine. The new sanctions are intended to cripple the Kremlin's ability to fund its ongoing conflict, causing global benchmark Brent crude to rise to $64.42 and U.S. crude to $60.24 per barrel. This move represents a notable escalation in economic pressure, as the administration also previously tried to persuade India to cease purchasing Russian oil.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US forces carried out a strike in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on a vessel believed to be involved in drug trafficking, as confirmed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This incident marks the eighth US strike against suspected drug boats since September, and the first to occur in the Pacific region. President Trump has repeatedly affirmed his administration's legal authority for these operations, which are justified by classifying drug-trafficking organizations as participants in a "non-international armed conflict." The aggressive campaign, which has caused at least 34 fatalities, has also fueled diplomatic tensions, particularly with the Colombian government, and signals a potential escalation to land-based anti-drug operations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 20:35:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, has sent a letter to ICE and Senate committees detailing widespread medical neglect experienced by pregnant women in US immigration custody. The report includes accounts of bleeding, miscarriages, shackling, and delayed or substandard prenatal care, often in violation of agency guidelines. Specific cases from detention centers in Louisiana and Georgia highlight issues like lack of informed consent for medical procedures, inadequate food, and denial of prenatal vitamins. Advocates urge ICE to release pregnant detainees and improve care, while a Homeland Security official dismissed the claims as unsubstantiated, stating such detentions are rare and subject to oversight.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to demolish the entire East Wing of the White House, as early as this weekend, to facilitate the construction of a new ballroom championed by President Trump. The project's estimated cost has now reached $300 million, which the White House states will be covered entirely by private donors. This extensive undertaking, which also involves modernizing the East Wing's bunker and offices, represents a significant departure from earlier promises that the existing building would remain largely untouched. Historic preservation groups have voiced strong opposition, warning that the massive addition will overwhelm the White House's architectural integrity, while the administration defends it as necessary modernization.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his legal team have formally requested approximately $230 million from the Justice Department to settle two federal damage claims related to investigations conducted during his first administration and the subsequent Biden administration. These claims specifically address the FBI and special counsel investigations into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents. This request presents a substantial conflict of interest, given that key Justice Department officials, such as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, previously acted as Trump's defense attorneys in these very cases. Legal experts have expressed skepticism regarding the unprecedented nature and the unusually high monetary valuation of these administrative claims, which, if approved, would ultimately be funded by American taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring significant rainfall to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. As of Wednesday evening, Melissa was moving slowly west, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, and could intensify into a hurricane by Friday. The storm's future path remains uncertain, with various models suggesting it could pass over Haiti, Cuba, or turn towards Central America. Forecasters warn of potential flash flooding and landslides from 5 to 10 inches of rain in affected areas, though major impacts on the mainland United States are currently not anticipated.</p>

          <p>An Australian politician has used parliamentary privilege to publicly name a person of interest, previously known as Mercury, in the 1970 disappearance of three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer from Fairy Meadow beach. This individual was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder in 2017 after a 1971 confession surfaced, but the case was dropped due to inadmissible evidence, with Mercury maintaining his innocence. Cheryl's family, who were present during the parliamentary naming, has been relentlessly pushing for a fresh inquiry, citing alleged missteps by authorities and new potential eyewitnesses. New South Wales Police maintain an ongoing investigation and a A$1m reward, while a parliamentary inquiry into long-term missing persons cases is now underway.</p>

          <p>Cargo theft rings are costing the U.S. up to $35 billion annually by employing sophisticated online schemes where they impersonate legitimate trucking companies to steal entire container loads. Thieves steal business identities and trick shippers into handing over valuable goods, often by redirecting unsuspecting drivers. Cases include Ari Bikes losing nearly 350 bicycles and celebrity chef Guy Fieri's Santo Tequila losing over $1 million worth of bottles. Law enforcement finds these crimes difficult to detect due to their initial appearance as legitimate transactions. Experts advise consumers to research sellers thoroughly before purchasing discounted high-value items online to avoid inadvertently supporting these illicit operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, citing Moscow's "senseless war" in Ukraine and President Putin's refusal to engage seriously in peace negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated these measures aim to cripple the Kremlin's "war machine," following intense Russian drone and missile attacks across Ukraine that killed at least seven people, including children. This move, praised by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, comes after a planned Trump-Putin meeting was shelved due to a lack of progress. The sanctions package, similar to one imposed by the UK, seeks to exert economic pressure and force Russia to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>New port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative have unexpectedly burdened Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a US-based ocean carrier, with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. A reclassification under Section 301, based on vessel construction rather than primary cargo, led to ACL's unique hybrid ships being treated as vehicle carriers. CEO Andrew Abbott expressed shock, stating the tariff could force the company, which transports critical oversize cargo for US manufacturers, to relocate operations, impacting American importers and exporters. Despite USTR's stance that rules are based on existing classification, ACL argues the policy disproportionately affects them and contradicts efforts to encourage US-based carriers.</p>

          <p>IBM announced impressive third-quarter results, exceeding Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, and subsequently raised its full-year guidance, attributing much of this success to strong artificial intelligence tailwinds. However, despite this robust financial performance, the company's stock experienced a decline of about 6% in extended trading, indicating a nuanced market reaction. CEO Arvind Krishna emphasized that global clients are increasingly adopting IBM's technology and domain expertise to enhance operational productivity and leverage AI, with the company's AI business surpassing $9.5 billion.

The report advocates for more comprehensive and easily accessible support within mainstream schools, without the need for lengthy assessment processes. Personal accounts from students like Evie and Betsey highlight the difficulties in accessing appropriate education and support, particularly for those with complex disabilities or late diagnoses. The Department for Education acknowledges the "vicious cycle" in the inherited system, with reforms now delayed until 2026, while the IPPR suggests new statutory support layers and inclusive school rewards.</p>

Nick Lai, head of auto research in Asia-Pacific at JPMorgan, estimates a flat growth in a bullish scenario, with a more than 50% chance of year-on-year slippage, potentially a 3-5% slump. This pessimistic outlook is attributed to the expiring incentives, which may have pulled forward significant demand. The automotive sector's last contraction was in 2020, when sales fell by 6.2% from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the company systematically violated state anti-discrimination laws by mistreating thousands of pregnant and disabled warehouse employees. The complaint, following a years-long investigation, claims Amazon placed workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and "unlawfully" retaliated, including terminations, for failing to meet rigid productivity targets after requesting accommodations. Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel denied the accusations, stating the company approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and ensures employee well-being.
