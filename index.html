          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, which allows taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill argue that it empowers parents to choose the best educational option for their children, while Democrats contend that it will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families. Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the bill as a historic step towards educational freedom for students.</p>

          <p>The South Texas location of Elon Muskâ€™s SpaceX rocket company has been officially designated as the city of Starbase following a local vote. The vote, which was approved by a wide margin, saw 212 residents in favor and 6 against, among a small group of voters who mostly work for Musk at SpaceX. The creation of Starbase as a city has raised concerns about Musk's increased control over the area, potentially impacting public access to a popular beach and state park during launches.

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have opted against legal marriage due to the country's surname law, which requires married couples to adopt the same last name. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, an NGO advocating for separate surnames, found that this rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% expressing a willingness to marry if separate surnames were permitted. The Justice Ministry notes that Japan is the only country, to its knowledge, that mandates couples to share a surname upon marriage, highlighting the law's significant impact on marital decisions.</p>

          <p>Katy Perry, known for her bubblegum pop, has faced recent online criticism following her Blue Origin spaceflight and subsequent world tour. Her reaction to the spaceflight, including kissing the ground, was met with mockery, and her dance moves during tour performances have also been criticized. Music writer Michael Cragg suggests Perry's persona feels out of touch, as she struggles to evolve beyond her 2010s cartoon-y image. Perry's latest single, Woman's World, received mixed reviews and failed to achieve significant chart success, further contributing to the negative reception.</p>
