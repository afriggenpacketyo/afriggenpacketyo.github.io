          <p>A volunteer at a Leicester church, Jay Hulme, became the victim of a prolonged stalking and harassment campaign by a lay preacher after he rejected her advances. Despite providing substantial evidence, Hulme's initial complaints were dismissed by the Bishop of Leicester, who instead accused him of witchcraft. The ordeal, which involved online abuse and false accusations of heinous crimes, continued for nearly two years before police intervention led to the stalker's conviction. This article highlights the significant failures of both law enforcement and the Church of England to protect the victim.</p>

          <p>A major Republican spending package, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by former President Trump, cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the Senate after a prolonged and dramatic vote. Four conservative senators, who initially held out, flipped their votes to "yes" after securing promises from leadership regarding deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. The bill's advancement was a key victory for the Republican leadership, though some senators remain uncommitted to the final passage. The legislation now faces a lengthy reading on the Senate floor, a tactic employed by Democrats to delay the process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Civil servants in China are increasingly avoiding dining out, a change attributed to stringent and unpredictable local austerity campaigns. An official from Sichuan province noted that his department head had implemented a ban on eating out, reflecting a broader trend of "ceng ceng jia ma," or adding extra layers of control. These local measures are often stricter than central government regulations. The shift in lifestyle is a direct consequence of the political pressure on officials to demonstrate frugality and avoid any appearance of impropriety.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at the judiciary, stating that it can incite threats and violence. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts urged politicians from both parties to be mindful of their language, referencing past instances where he felt compelled to speak out. His remarks come amid heightened political polarization and after a man pleaded guilty to attempting to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, underscoring the real-world consequences of such rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Large-scale anti-government protests in Belgrade, Serbia, turned violent as police clashed with demonstrators demanding an early election and the end of President Aleksandar Vucic's rule. An estimated 140,000 people rallied in the capital, with riot police deploying tear gas and stun grenades, leading to dozens of arrests. The protests, ongoing for months, were sparked by a deadly railway station roof collapse that critics blame on corruption.

An American firm, REalloys, is collaborating with a Canadian council on a project to produce high-performance magnet materials using ore from Brazil. Analysts suggest that building a supply chain independent of China, which has long dominated the market, will likely require government subsidies and tariffs to be viable.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island effect," the phenomenon that causes cities to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat more than natural landscapes. This stored heat is released slowly, keeping temperatures elevated, especially overnight. The effect is compounded by waste heat from vehicles and buildings, making urban populations more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and more intense heatwaves.</p>

The initiative, planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates students on UV levels and proper sunscreen application. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases later-life cancer risk, and with melanoma cases projected to rise, early education is a key preventative measure.

          <p>Following its recent 12-day war with Israel, Iran's regime has deepened its domestic crackdown, executing six men on espionage charges and arresting over 700 people accused of having ties to Israel. Human rights activists argue the executed men were denied due process and that the regime is using the post-war climate to instill fear and suppress dissent. The government has also announced new surveillance measures to monitor citizens' online activities. Many Iranians express fear that the regime, feeling wounded, is taking revenge on its own people.</p>

          <p>Through an audio diary, 28-year-old Gazan teacher Hanya Aljamal shares her daily experience of life in the war-torn region, where she now lives with her family in their fifth temporary home. Once an independent professional applying for a Master's degree abroad, she now struggles to find purpose as her school has been destroyed. Her diary captures the constant fear of explosions, the psychological toll of drone surveillance, and the profound grief of losing friends, students, and colleagues.
