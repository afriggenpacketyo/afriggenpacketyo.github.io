The bill aims to extend the 2017 tax law, but its impact may be overshadowed by the negative effects of the tariffs, which could raise costs and batter markets. The article suggests that Republicans face a dilemma, needing Trump's support for the tax extension while also needing to address the economic damage caused by his trade policies, creating a precarious path to the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A woman was killed by an alligator while canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in central Florida, after the alligator attacked and tipped the canoe. The husband attempted to fight off the alligator but was unsuccessful, and the woman was later recovered from the water and declared dead. Nuisance alligator trappers were called to the scene and recovered two alligators, and officials are reminding people to keep a safe distance from alligators, keep pets on a leash, and avoid swimming in designated areas during dusk and dawn.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed Alvin Brown, the vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), who was appointed by President Joe Biden. This move leaves the NTSB with four board members appointed during Trump's first term, with Jennifer Homendy, appointed as chair by Biden, remaining. The NTSB, an independent agency, investigates transportation accidents and makes safety recommendations, and Brown's firing aligns with other dismissals of Democratic members of independent agencies by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government in Germany has experienced a difficult start, failing to secure the necessary support in the Bundestag for his election in the first round of voting. A Deutschlandtrend survey reveals that only 40% of respondents are optimistic about the coalition of conservatives and social democrats, with 59% doubting Merz's suitability for the office. Despite these challenges, the CDU/CSU has seen a slight gain in voter support, while the far-right AfD remains a significant political force, classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the domestic intelligence service.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Tufts Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont, where she can continue her challenge to her detention. The court rejected the administration's bid for emergency relief, emphasizing Ozturk's need for ready access to legal and medical services. Ozturk was arrested after the administration revoked her student visa, accusing her of involvement in associations that "may undermine U.S. foreign policy," and her lawyers argue her detention violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights.</p>
