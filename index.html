          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel linked the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. The decision followed pressure from FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr and a move by Nexstar, a major affiliate owner, to preempt the show. While Kimmel has not been fired, Disney executives reportedly plan to discuss his on-air conduct before his return, sparking a debate about free speech and corporate accountability in media.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts anticipate that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will likely implement only moderate easing measures for the remainder of the year. This cautious approach is expected to narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries, potentially reducing capital outflow pressures and providing support for the yuan. The PBOC's strategy reflects a careful balancing act amid global economic shifts, with a minor rate cut forecasted for the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. Scientists measured the ethanol content in figs and plums eaten by the chimps and calculated that their daily intake is equivalent to nearly two alcoholic drinks for a human. The study supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors, who were drawn to the scent of ethanol in ripe fruit.</p>
