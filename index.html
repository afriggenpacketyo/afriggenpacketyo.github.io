          <p>A Saudi-backed boxing event transformed Times Square, featuring fighters arriving in various vehicles, including a traditional yellow taxicab. Teófimo López defended his title at the event, marking a unique spectacle in the heart of New York City. The fighters were transported from a nearby hotel, navigating through traffic to reach the ring, which offered a shortened ringwalk experience due to the location constraints. The event drew a large crowd and captured the attention of both sports enthusiasts and casual observers in the bustling urban environment.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar, driven by increased capital inflows.

The move comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further stimulate capital flow into Hong Kong.

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts has been implemented in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry amidst ongoing policy changes. This tariff, following the implementation of a 25% import tax on cars, is intended to incentivize domestic manufacturing. However, analysts predict that this will likely lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, despite some companies experiencing a sales surge due to concerns about future price hikes. The situation remains fluid, with some car companies withdrawing financial guidance due to the uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The number of people diagnosed with autism has risen significantly, prompting discussions about the definition of autism and factors contributing to the increase. While there's no consensus on whether there are truly more autistic people, changes in diagnostic criteria and greater awareness have led to increased diagnoses. The rise is also attributed to better understanding of autism in women and adults, who were previously underdiagnosed. The increase has brought both support and tensions over who owns the word and what it means.</p>
