          <h2>Study Links Microplastics From Biodegradable Material to Diabetes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 04:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers from China and the United States discovered that these microplastics altered gut metabolism and damaged the gut barrier in mice. The study's corresponding author, Cui Xuejing, noted this is the first time microplastics have been found to enter the body's metabolic cycle. These findings suggest a potential link between PLA microplastics and conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. </p>

          <p>The disappearance of Jermain Charlo in June 2018 remains unsolved, with the Missoula Police Department and other agencies actively investigating the case. Charlo was last seen at The Badlander bar in Missoula, Montana, with her ex-boyfriend Michael DeFrance, who has provided conflicting accounts of the night's events. Cellphone data indicated Charlo's phone pinged off a tower near DeFrance's residence after she disappeared, but the phone was later discarded in Idaho and never recovered. Despite extensive searches and investigations, including exploring potential human trafficking connections, Charlo has not been found, and DeFrance has never been named a suspect. </p>

The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, could be used to make lunar bases self-sufficient and provide fuel for spacecraft.

          <p>With the Labour government approaching its first year, its upcoming Spending Review presents a crucial opportunity to demonstrate a confident and deliverable economic vision to the private sector and international investors. The government's focus is on long-term capital spending, earmarking 2.7% of GDP for this purpose, the highest sustained level in nearly half a century. Key projects include a high-speed rail line between Liverpool and Manchester and increased spending on research and development. Despite this, the government faces challenges in balancing long-term investment with tight settlements on day-to-day spending, exacerbated by the lingering effects of the pandemic.

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, once a supporter of a hard-line presidential candidate, now faces execution after being convicted of ‚Äúinsulting Islamic sanctities.‚Äù His music, which challenged Iran's theocracy, gained popularity among the country's youth, especially after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Tataloo's lyrics became increasingly political and critical of the authorities, leading to his arrest and sentencing.
