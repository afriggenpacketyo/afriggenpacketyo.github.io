            <h2>UK Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in February</h2>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK economy experienced a surprising surge in February, expanding by 0.5%, exceeding economists' predictions of just 0.1%. This growth was largely driven by a robust performance in the services sector, particularly in computer programming, telecoms, and car dealerships, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Manufacturing, electronics, and pharmaceutical businesses also contributed positively, with the car industry rebounding after recent struggles. However, concerns remain about the impact of impending tax increases, rising energy bills, and US tariffs, which could curtail future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new drug called capivasertib has been approved for use on the NHS in England to treat advanced breast cancer, offering hope to approximately 3,000 women annually. Clinical trials have demonstrated that capivasertib can slow the progression of the disease and shrink tumors in a significant number of patients. The drug, a targeted therapy, works by blocking the activity of the AKT protein molecule, which drives cancer growth. When combined with hormone therapy, it has been shown to double the time it takes for the cancer to grow.</p>

While the yuan has weakened recently, economists anticipate the central bank will manage a gradual depreciation. Rapid devaluation could erode consumer confidence and prompt capital flight, which policymakers are eager to avoid, especially given the current economic climate. A majority of analysts polled by CNBC expect the central bank to engineer an orderly and gradual depreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Danish shoppers are increasingly boycotting U.S. products in response to President Trump's trade policies and ambitions regarding Greenland. Grocery stores are making it easier to identify European-owned brands, and consumers are expressing a preference for European products. The trend reflects a broader shift in consumer sentiment, with travelers also turning away from trips to the U.S. amid trade tensions and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Tesla has also seen sales drop significantly across the region, with some dealerships vandalized.</p>

This unusual act of compassion and respect, even in the midst of war, has become a symbol of peace and reconciliation.

            <p>Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plan, aimed at reshaping global trade and bolstering the American economy, has faced partial reversals and uncertainty. While the president has secured negotiations with trading partners and potentially increased tariff revenue, the instability of his policies is hindering business investment. The trade war with China carries significant risks and may alienate key allies. Economists warn that the tariffs could ultimately raise consumer prices, contradicting Trump's promise of lower costs.

The EU must act swiftly to shore up its greatest weakness: its dependence on fossil-fuel imports, and act as swiftly as possible to shore up its greatest weakness: its dependence on fossil-fuel imports.</p>
