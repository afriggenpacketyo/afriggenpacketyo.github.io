          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei, which houses artifacts evacuated from mainland China, is facing a decline in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum's director aims for 3.5 million visitors in 2025, but lawmaker Ko Chih-en questions this target given the significant drop in visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, which fell drastically to 50,000 last year due to deteriorating cross-strait relations and tourism policy changes. In 2024, the museum recorded 2.87 million visitors, with the largest overseas group coming from South Korea, followed by Japan, highlighting the impact of political factors on tourism. Cross-strait relations have declined since 2016, leading to travel restrictions between both regions.</p>

Garcia acknowledged that the year off impacted him mentally and physically, while Romero expressed his ambition to fight anyone at 147 pounds, emphasizing his focus on championships over money. The article notes Garcia's previous suspension for a failed drug test and being overweight in his last fight against Haney, adding context to his recent performance.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges like inflation and housing affordability, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton vying for leadership.

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to stabilize the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action precedes the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where potential interest rate cuts are expected, which could further drive capital into Hong Kong. The HKMA stated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength is due to equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation against the US dollar, and it will continue to monitor the market to ensure stability.</p>

This "revolution" seeks to address economic stagnation, bureaucratic dysfunction, and external pressures like potential US tariffs. By reducing the number of provinces and district-level party branches, the central government aims to exert more direct control and refocus the state on economic security, though resistance from vested interests is anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Colorado, Denver, and local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies, arguing they hinder federal efforts to deport undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit claims these policies interfere with federal immigration law enforcement and cites a controversial apartment complex in Aurora allegedly controlled by a Venezuelan gang as an example. Local officials deny the gang's widespread control but acknowledge issues at the complex. The suit seeks to invalidate laws preventing local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities, prompting responses from state and city officials defending their policies and vowing to defend their values.</p>

          <p>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor Organization (ITER) is participating in the World Exposition in Osaka to showcase nuclear fusion energy as a clean energy technology. ITER's exhibits will explain the fusion energy process and the experimental reactor being built in France. Japan, a key contributor to the project, is highlighting its role in demonstrating the feasibility of fusion energy. Fusion energy, often called "the Sun on Earth," is generated when light atomic nuclei merge, offering a byproduct-free energy source, though scientists believe it is still decades away.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey found that 58% of Japanese citizens believe social media platforms should be legally regulated during elections to combat the spread of unverified information. This comes amid criticism of online posts influencing a recent gubernatorial election. While 29% believe social media operators should self-regulate, the survey highlights concerns about freedom of expression versus the need for accurate information. The survey also covered other constitutional matters, including Article 9 and same-sex marriage, reflecting diverse opinions on key social and political issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to reduce staffing at the CIA by 1,200 positions and other intelligence agencies by thousands, according to a report by the Washington Post. The cuts will be implemented over several years, partly through reduced hiring, to align the agencies with Trump's national security priorities. The CIA stated that the changes are part of a strategy to renew energy, provide leadership opportunities, and improve mission effectiveness. The administration has also eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at these agencies.</p>

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was exploring the option because the neighborhood’s main reservoir — the Santa Ynez Reservoir — had been taken offline as a result of a torn cover, which officials had begun preparations to repair early in 2024. But the plan to bring the old reservoir back online was never completed. Ellen Cheng, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said in an email on Friday that the city ultimately determined that bringing the reservoir back online could have posed a risk to workers and residents of nearby homes because of structural and other safety issues.</p>

          <p>For Shanghai resident Kong Jiongjiong, a missed opportunity meant the difference between a windfall and a potential loss. Kong, a journalist, paid 1.5 million yuan (US$206,289) in 2015 for a 50-square-metre (538 sq ft) flat in Shanghai’s Hongkou district, using her life savings and loans from a bank. Just months later, a nearby parcel of land was sold at a record price of 70,000 yuan per square metre, more than double what she paid. China’s central bank, worried about an asset bubble, unleashed market-cooling measures in the summer of 2018 to clamp down on prices. That was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic , which drove China’s property prices into their worst slump in decades – and they have yet to recover.</p>
