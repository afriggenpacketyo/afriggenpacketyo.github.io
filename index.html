          <h2>New Exhibition Highlights the Hawaiian Royal Origins of Surfing in America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new exhibit at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History explores the forgotten origins of surfing in the mainland United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a military school in California, introduced the sport by crafting boards from local redwood and riding the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. This historical event, documented in local newspapers at the time, predates the more widely known popularization of the sport by Duke Kahanamoku. The story showcases a significant moment of cultural exchange and the evolution of a now-globally popular sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prospect of joint weapons manufacturing between the United States and Taiwan is causing alarm among analysts in mainland China, who warn it could undermine regional stability. The discussion was amplified after US Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, suggested such cooperation was likely following a visit to Taipei. While the US and Taiwan see strategic and industrial benefits in co-production, which would be a shift from the long-standing policy of direct arms sales, Beijing views it as a significant escalation. The development highlights the increasingly tense security dynamics in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly accused the club of breaking promises and is demanding they allow him to join Newcastle United before the transfer deadline. In a social media statement, Wissa claims he has written assurances that he could leave for a "reasonable offer," but alleges Brentford has now inflated his price from £40m to around £65m. Newcastle has reportedly had two bids rejected, the latest being a £35m guaranteed fee with add-ons. The DR Congo international, who has not been training with the first team, expressed frustration and stated that being forced to stay would "tarnish" his time at the club.</p>

          <p>The price of the U.S. Open's signature Honey Deuce cocktail, now at $23, has increased at a rate faster than general inflation over the past decade. Since 2015, the cost of the popular vodka-based beverage has risen by 53%, compared to a 36% increase in the broader Consumer Price Index during the same period. Despite its high price, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue. This analysis highlights how the pricing of specialty items at major sporting events can significantly exceed standard economic trends, reflecting strong consumer demand and event-specific marketing power.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 portraits of Ada Katz, the wife and muse of acclaimed painter Alex Katz, from their 50-year marriage. Alex Katz, now in his 90s, has painted his wife over 300 times, capturing her style and appearance rather than attempting to convey deep emotion. He came of age as an artist when abstract expressionism was dominant but remained committed to his unique form of realism, facing criticism for years. The collection highlights his focus on form, light, and fashion, with Katz likening his detached portraits to a mirror that allows viewers to see themselves.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece reflects on the complex question of blame in the 2013 heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes aboard his yacht. The article analyzes the role of Alix Tichelman, who was with Hayes, administered the heroin, and failed to call for help, ultimately pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter. The author questions the legal outcome, suggesting Hayes was an active participant who created the situation by soliciting Tichelman and asking her to inject him. The piece argues that while Tichelman's inaction was a critical failure, holding her solely responsible ignores Hayes's own contribution to his demise, raising ethical questions about accountability in consensual high-risk activities.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Abruzzo, the former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fired by Donald Trump, warns that the administration's actions are hobbling the labor watchdog and threatening to erode workers' rights. The firing of NLRB chair Gwynne Wilcox and budget cuts have left the agency without a quorum and unable to effectively enforce labor laws, empowering corporations to challenge its constitutionality. This situation, combined with court rulings favoring companies like SpaceX, could render the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 ineffective. Abruzzo fears a return to an era of lower wages and poor working conditions without legal recourse for workers.</p>

          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert examines the ethical dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global crises, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. Drawing on religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, he posits that this empathy should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or mudita in Buddhism. The piece suggests that allowing oneself to experience both happiness and sorrow is a form of resistance against cynicism and despair, and a necessary part of a balanced, connected human experience.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a move experts warn could destabilize the vaccine market and eliminate financial recourse for those who suffer rare side effects. Critics argue that dismantling the program, which shields manufacturers from most litigation, could cause companies to exit the market, leading to vaccine shortages. Kennedy's proposals are seen as part of a long-standing campaign against vaccines, which could undermine public trust in science and make it harder for the genuinely injured to receive aid, forcing them into a more difficult and expensive traditional court system.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has provided crucial clarification for consumers hoping to claim the up to $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, which is set to be eliminated after September 30. According to the IRS, a "written binding contract" and a payment made on or before the deadline are sufficient to qualify, even if the vehicle is delivered later. This guidance provides a valuable loophole for buyers facing inventory shortages or delivery delays, allowing them to lock in the credit by ordering a vehicle and making a deposit. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased EVs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., is facing significant setbacks in court, with grand juries refusing to indict in at least five recent cases involving alleged assaults on federal officers. Judges have also expressed frustration with prosecutors for missteps, delays, and bringing weak cases, often escalating minor offenses to federal felonies. Despite the White House touting over 1,000 arrests, the repeated failures to secure indictments suggest that D.C. grand jurors are skeptical of the crackdown. This resistance from within the judicial system highlights the challenges of implementing the administration's aggressive law-and-order agenda in a largely unsympathetic city.</p>

Martinez, a two-time FIFA goalkeeper of the year with extensive Premier League experience, would represent a more established and high-profile solution to the team's needs.

          <h2>Global Matcha Craze Leads to Shortages and Soaring Prices in Japan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has created severe shortages and record-high prices in Japan. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, has skyrocketed, with some retailers reporting that consumer prices have doubled in the last year. Japan's aging farming community is struggling to keep up with the labor-intensive cultivation process, prompting the government to consider subsidies. Major beverage companies like Ito En are facing production bottlenecks, while cafes and shops are rationing supplies to cope with the unprecedented demand from both domestic and international consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents to ensure their children attend school from the very first week of the new term, citing new data linking early absences to chronic truancy. The data reveals that over half of pupils who missed school in the first week of 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, persistent absenteeism remains higher than pre-COVID levels. Phillipson emphasized that missing even a few days early on can negatively impact a child's future, calling for a concerted effort from parents and schools to prioritize attendance.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration has ordered the removal of approximately 400 "non-standard" pieces of street art across the state, framing it as an effort to keep transportation facilities free of political ideologies. The move began with painting over a rainbow crosswalk memorializing victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and has since targeted student-designed safety crosswalks and other community art projects. While the state cites a federal directive and safety concerns, critics and affected municipalities call it a politically motivated attack on LGBTQ+ communities and local governance. Several cities, including Fort Lauderdale and Key West, are vowing to fight the removal orders.</p>

The launch of the femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, represents Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and a rare entry for a Chinese company into the North American launch market. CAS Space hailed the mission as a milestone demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and reliability of its Kinetica-1 rocket. The collaboration highlights China's growing efforts to expand its role in the global commercial space sector, traditionally dominated by American and European companies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is actively working to restore Confederate monuments and memorials that were removed under the previous administration. Hegseth announced the return of a controversial Confederate statue to Arlington National Cemetery, describing it as "beautiful and historic" while blaming its removal on "woke lemmings." Other actions include returning a portrait of Robert E. Lee to West Point and re-christening bases with names of Confederate generals. The author, a veteran, argues that this approach conflates honoring soldiers' sacrifices with glorifying a treasonous cause built on slavery, and stands in stark contrast to how other nations commemorate ancestors who fought for unjust causes.</p>

          <p>A U.S. naval deployment to the Caribbean, coupled with renewed denunciations of President Nicolás Maduro by the Trump administration, has heightened anxiety and uncertainty in Venezuela. While some hope for intervention, many citizens are weary after years of crisis and express a desire to continue their daily lives without being paralyzed by geopolitical tensions. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, engaging in prisoner swaps and allowing some oil operations while also increasing bounties and military pressure. For ordinary Venezuelans, the situation is another chapter in a long saga of political turmoil, leaving them caught between domestic struggles and the unpredictable actions of world powers.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party is currently facing historically low approval ratings and internal criticism of being "weak," some strategists see reasons for optimism. They point to a growing lead in generic congressional ballot polls, an emerging bench of energetic potential presidential candidates, and President Trump's own declining popularity as key factors. Political analysts suggest a recovery plan focused on rallying public opposition to Trump, addressing economic concerns like affordability, and organizing for midterm victories. The party remains divided on policy and strategy, but vigorous internal debate is seen by some as a necessary step toward redefining its message and reconnecting with voters.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws on Toni Morrison's 1995 analysis of fascism, arguing that its roots in America are deeply entwined with racism and that its rise is a gradual process, not a sudden event. The author contends that Black history provides a powerful model for combating authoritarianism through unwavering belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of resistance, and profound faith. The article suggests that true opposition to fascism requires acknowledging its long-standing presence in American culture, not just its current political manifestations. It calls for drawing inspiration from the resilience and strategies of Black Americans who have historically fought against systemic oppression.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the demand for home air conditioning is rising, sparking a debate about its environmental, financial, and health impacts. Environmental groups are concerned about the potent greenhouse gases (HFCs) used as refrigerants, while the extra electricity usage adds to already high energy bills. Experts note that while poorly maintained units can pose health risks like spreading viruses, well-kept systems can improve air quality. The discussion highlights a paradox: air conditioning can be a life-saving necessity in a warming world, yet its current technology contributes to the climate problem it aims to solve.</p>

          <p>Activists and political scientists are expressing growing alarm that the United States is transitioning toward a "competitive authoritarian system" under President Donald Trump. They point to a pattern of actions including efforts to control the bureaucracy and military, criminalizing political opposition, targeting critics with FBI raids, and revoking Secret Service protection for rivals. Observers who have experienced authoritarianism abroad note grim parallels in the consolidation of power and the creation of a climate of fear. While some believe it is not too late to reverse the trend, others argue that these developments are an acceleration of a pre-existing "design flaw" in American democracy.</p>
