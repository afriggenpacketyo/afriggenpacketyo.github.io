          <p>Former President Trump announced a new trade deal with Indonesia, reducing previously threatened U.S. tariffs to 19% in exchange for greater market access for American companies. According to Trump, the agreement includes Indonesian commitments to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as dozens of Boeing aircraft. Indonesian officials have not immediately confirmed the terms of the pact, which follows a period of escalating trade tensions. This deal is one of several recent agreements aimed at resolving trade disputes, although key terms in similar pacts with other nations have sometimes remained unconfirmed.

          <p>A Seoul court is retrying Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979, to re-evaluate whether his act was treason or a patriotic move toward democracy. Kim, who was executed for insurrection, remains a divisive historical figure, seen by some as a patriot and by others as a power-hungry killer. His family sought the retrial, arguing his actions were intended to prevent further bloodshed under Park's authoritarian regime. The case re-examines a pivotal moment in South Korean history, forcing a reflection on its turbulent path to democracy.</p>

          <p>Robin Kaye, a long-time music supervisor for "American Idol," and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were discovered shot to death in their Encino, Los Angeles home. Police found the couple, both 70, during a welfare check on Monday, each with gunshot wounds to the head. Investigators are treating the case as a double homicide and are searching for suspects, noting a broken sliding glass door at the residence. The show expressed its devastation, remembering Kaye as a beloved and respected cornerstone of the "Idol" family since 2009.</p>

          <p>During a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, former President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania. The initiative aims to build a new artificial intelligence economy by constructing energy-intensive data centers and an innovation hub for worker training. Hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, the event highlighted plans for major infrastructure projects, including 10 new Westinghouse nuclear reactors. While praised by industry leaders, the summit faced protests from activists concerned about its focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests. (not investment advice)</p>

Lead attorney Dick Harpootlian argues this new evidence might have led them to call Smith to the stand.

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues EU's Pressure on China Regarding Russia Is Counterproductive for Trade</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article suggests that the European Union's strategy of pressuring China over its perceived support for Russia's war in Ukraine could be detrimental to the EU's own trade interests. As the EU seeks to "de-risk" its economy from China, its firm stance may not effectively influence Beijing's position on Moscow and could exacerbate existing trade imbalances. The author contends that the EU's "if you're not with us, you're against us" approach oversimplifies complex geopolitical interests. Ultimately, escalating tensions serves neither side and will not help the EU address its economic challenges or secure critical supply chains.</p>

          <p>British counter-terror police have issued a warning that hostile states like Russia, Iran, and China are increasingly using proxies, including teenagers and petty criminals, to conduct operations in the UK. This activity, which now accounts for about 20% of their workload, includes acts of sabotage and targeted violence. Authorities are urging parents and teachers to be vigilant for signs of manipulation, as young people may be enticed online with money to perform tasks without understanding the severe implications. The warning follows a five-fold increase in police work dedicated to tackling hostile state activity since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans. The program, which provides deportation protection and work permits, was set to end, but the court granted a one-week stay to allow for legal arguments. Advocacy groups praised the pause, arguing that Afghanistan remains unsafe and that ending the program would uproot families who fled Taliban persecution. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, stating that TPS was never intended to be a permanent program and that security conditions in Afghanistan have improved.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents reveal the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is considering hiring experienced international air traffic controllers to address significant staffing shortages in the U.S. This initiative comes as over 90% of U.S. control centers are understaffed, leading to flight delays and safety concerns. However, the proposal faces major hurdles, including national security risks and legal barriers, as most federal jobs require U.S. citizenship. Security experts are reportedly alarmed by the prospect of foreign nationals gaining access to sensitive airspace and communications data, creating a conflict with the administration's broader anti-migrant labor stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned wearable tech company Whoop that it is illegally marketing its new Blood Pressure Insights (BPI) feature without proper regulatory approval. The FDA letter states that because the feature provides blood pressure estimations, it qualifies as a medical device intended to diagnose or treat disease, which requires a rigorous review process. Whoop contends the feature is for wellness and performance insights, not medical diagnosis, and believes the agency is overstepping its authority. The FDA has given the company 15 days to address the alleged violations.</p>

Dive teams and sonar have already located large objects buried under deep water, and officials fear some victims may be trapped within the debris.

An NPR investigation revealed that a DOGE-linked staffer has high-level access to the system, allowing them to view sensitive data and potentially alter payments with little oversight.

          <p>The poor box-office performance of Pixar's latest film, "Elio," is raising questions about the studio's future as a guaranteed hitmaker. After the massive success of "Inside Out 2," "Elio" debuted with a record-low opening weekend, suggesting the Pixar brand alone no longer ensures a theatrical event. The article notes the film's tumultuous creative process, which saw a change in director and significant script revisions that may have weakened the protagonist's motivation. This failure, combined with a slate of upcoming sequels, suggests Pixar may be shying away from riskier, personal stories in favor of safer, established franchises.</p>
