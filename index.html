        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Labor Department reported a substantial downward revision of 911,000 nonfarm payroll jobs through March 2025, indicating a weaker economy than previously understood. This significant adjustment, over 50% higher than last year's, adds to evidence of a softening labor market, particularly in leisure, hospitality, and professional services. The revisions also intensify scrutiny on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data collection methods, as recent monthly figures similarly point to sluggish job growth. This economic data could bolster arguments for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, this article explores whether to invest in a single jumbo CD or multiple CD accounts. Experts suggest locking in high rates now, noting that shorter-term CDs currently offer competitive yields despite traditional jumbo CDs typically having higher rates. Considerations include minimum deposit requirements, flexibility versus simplicity, and FDIC insurance limits, which cover up to $250,000 per depositor per institution. Savers should evaluate their financial goals and liquidity needs when choosing a CD strategy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched a strike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, prompting condemnation from Qatar and a shelter-in-place order from the U.S. Embassy. This action is part of a broader escalation, as Israel also ordered Gaza City residents to evacuate, threatening "great force" if hostages are not released. Concurrently, Israel's defense minister mandated home demolitions in the West Bank following an attack, a move human rights groups denounce as collective punishment. Meanwhile, a Gaza-bound aid flotilla reportedly faced a drone attack in Tunisia, adding further complexity to the volatile regional situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL legend Peyton Manning publicly criticized Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson for poor situational awareness during a late-game scenario against the Minnesota Vikings. After a Bears touchdown left 2:02 on the clock and one timeout, Manning argued the team should have kicked the ball out of bounds to stop the clock at the two-minute warning. Instead, the kickoff was returned, burning valuable time and leaving the Bears with minimal offensive opportunity in their eventual 27-24 loss. Johnson later admitted the kickoff was not intended to go into the end zone.</p>

          <p>A CEO with extensive hiring experience highlights three subtle but critical red flags that often signal trouble in job interviews. These include arriving late, which suggests poor planning and disrespect for time, and providing answers that lack personal experience, metrics, or specific examples, especially in the age of AI. The third red flag is a lack of energy, enthusiasm, or curiosity during the interview, indicating potential disengagement on the job. Candidates are advised to be early, use the STAR method for answers, and genuinely showcase their personality and engagement.</p>

It features an unmanned turret with a 105mm main gun and advanced fire control, alongside a sophisticated protection system combining passive and active defenses rather than thick armor.

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Democratic state lawmaker and Presbyterian seminarian, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican John Cornyn. Talarico, known for his eloquent style and emphasis on faith, aims to appeal across the political spectrum, drawing praise from national Democratic leaders. He faces a primary challenge from former Representative Colin Allred, who holds a fundraising advantage and statewide recognition. Talarico hopes to leverage Texans' desire for a political reset, campaigning on issues like lower prices and less corruption, while navigating the state's expensive media markets and the challenges of building a diverse coalition.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Braun, a New York drug dealer whose federal prison sentence was commuted by President Donald Trump in 2021, has been found guilty of violating his parole terms. A federal judge ruled that prosecutors proved Braun committed several recent crimes, including menacing a hospital nurse and a synagogue member, groping his family's nanny, and evading bridge tolls. Braun, who had served only about a year of a 10-year sentence for drug-related charges, now faces up to five additional years in prison. His sentencing hearing is tentatively scheduled for October 9.</p>

          <p>A Russian glide bomb strike on the village of Yarova in Ukraine's Donetsk region killed at least 24 civilians and injured nearly two dozen others as they queued for pensions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "brutally savage" attack, calling for stronger international sanctions against Russia. This incident follows Russia's intensified aerial strikes after stalled peace efforts, including the largest attack on Kyiv since the war began. The European Union's foreign affairs chief noted that member states are providing unprecedented military aid to Ukraine, totaling over €63 billion since 2022.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Oil Change International reports that the U.S. fossil fuel industry receives nearly $31 billion in annual subsidies, a figure that has more than doubled since 2017. These extensive financial supports, including tax breaks and lower land rates, are identified as a major barrier to decarbonization efforts crucial for addressing the climate crisis. The report highlights that these subsidies enable new production and disproportionately benefit shareholders and executives. Despite President Biden's pledge to eliminate such handouts, recent legislation is poised to provide the industry with billions more.</p>

The burger, priced at $10.99, aligns with CEO Rob Lynch's vision of "democratization of fine dining," bringing high-quality culinary experiences to the fast-casual market. This follows the success of its high-priced Dubai Chocolate Pistachio Shake, which sold out widely. Despite some slowing sales in the fast-casual sector, Shake Shack reports overall strong business, offsetting rising beef prices with productivity improvements.</p>

          <p>House Democrats released a screenshot of an alleged letter and sexually suggestive drawing from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, included in Epstein's 2003 50th birthday book. The message contains a cryptic conversation between Trump and Epstein. The White House vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, claiming Trump did not draw or sign it, and his legal team is pursuing defamation litigation against The Wall Street Journal, which first reported its existence. This release fuels ongoing political controversy and an investigation by the House Oversight Committee into Epstein-related documents, with Republicans accusing Democrats of politicizing the information.</p>

          <p>Immigration sweeps in Los Angeles are intensifying after the Supreme Court reversed a ban on the Trump administration's "roving patrols," raising concerns about indiscriminate arrests based on appearance.

Domestically, a federal appeals court upheld an $83.3 million defamation verdict against Donald Trump in favor of E. Jean Carroll. Other reports include Rand Paul's criticism of J.D.

Additionally, the EU's Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles will introduce extended producer responsibility schemes, requiring textile and footwear makers to cover collection, sorting, and recycling costs.
