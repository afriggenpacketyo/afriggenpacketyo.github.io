        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's economic strategy is defined by a proactive, long-term planning process, exemplified by its successive five-year plans. These plans have evolved from Soviet-style targets to sophisticated strategies for reform and consumer-led growth, involving extensive consultation with experts. In contrast, the United States is portrayed as eschewing centralized planning in favor of market forces, a system the author claims has become dysfunctional due to intense political polarization. The piece suggests this fundamental difference in approach allows China to strategically shape its future while the U.S. is often limited to reacting to immediate events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires has identified significant shortcomings, including resource shortages and outdated emergency alert policies. The report, commissioned by county supervisors, found that critical staffing vacancies and unreliable communication systems hampered the ability of first responders to coordinate effectively. Evacuation warnings were consequently delayed, with some alerts being issued long after homes had already been destroyed. While the report praised the heroic actions of individual responders, it emphasized the urgent need for clearer policies, better training, and integrated communication tools to improve public safety in future disasters.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting for Beijing's outgoing envoy, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and the Chinese ambassador emphasized a desire to prevent South China Sea disputes from defining their bilateral relationship. Both sides publicly reiterated that maritime issues are not the entirety of their relations, echoing language from a 2023 joint statement. President Marcos called for continued focus on strengthening trade, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions. The statements signal a diplomatic effort to de-escalate recent tensions and find common ground, with the Chinese envoy expressing hope that relations can be put "back on track."</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has displayed notable irritation with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, signaling internal tensions within the Labour Party over its future direction. Burnham has been vocal in presenting his own vision for the party, which some in Downing Street perceive as an implicit criticism of Starmer's leadership and a lack of clear government strategy. Starmer's frustration became public when he compared Burnham's economic ideas to those of former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, a pointed remark invoking a period of economic turmoil. This friction highlights a broader debate within Labour on how to effectively counter the rise of Reform UK and define its own political identity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a new 100% tariff on all imported branded and patented pharmaceutical products, effective October 1, in a move aimed at pressuring companies to build manufacturing plants in the United States. Companies with facilities already under construction will be exempt from the levy. The policy has drawn criticism from pharmaceutical firms and health experts, who warn it could disrupt global supply chains, increase drug prices for consumers, and potentially worsen medication shortages. Despite these concerns, the administration argues the tariffs are a necessary national security measure to reduce reliance on foreign drug manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder of venture capital firm B Capital, believes the world is in the very early stages of an artificial intelligence "super cycle" that could last for two decades. He argues that AI will fundamentally change every global industry, from drug development to the job market. While acknowledging that the current market may be "frothy" or overvalued due to short-term hype, Ganguly asserts the long-term impact will be profound. He identifies the next major profit opportunities in the "AI native app layer," predicting that companies in this space, including those from India, will become global leaders.

          <p>China is set to open the world's highest bridge to traffic this Sunday in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. The new bridge, which crosses the Huajiang Grand Canyon, has a deck positioned 625 meters (2,050 feet) above the river below, making it taller than the country's tallest skyscraper. With a total length of 2,890 meters, it is also poised to become the world's longest mountain bridge. This engineering feat further cements Guizhou's reputation as a hub for record-breaking bridge construction, as the province is already home to nearly half of the world's 100 tallest bridges.</p>

          <p>A former Orange County sheriff’s deputy, Arcadio Rodriguez, will serve no jail time after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges for sexually assaulting two female inmates while on duty. Rodriguez was sentenced to time already served under home confinement but must register as a sex offender for at least ten years. The assaults, which occurred in 2022 at a maximum-security jail, involved touching the women over their clothes and showing them pornographic videos. The District Attorney expressed frustration, noting that state law prevented felony charges because the assault was not skin-to-skin, and stated he is seeking to change the law for harsher penalties.</p>

The statue, titled "Best Friends Forever," was initially installed with a permit but was removed less than 24 hours later, with officials citing a height discrepancy. The anonymous activist group behind the statue, "Secret Handshake," claims they were not given the standard 24-hour notice to correct the issue before its removal.

This type of bacteria is resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics available, making infections like pneumonia and bloodstream infections extremely difficult to treat and increasing the risk of death. Public health officials note an association between the surge and the widespread use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <p>Geoffrey Todd West, a 50-year-old man convicted of the 1997 murder of a gas station clerk, was executed in Alabama using nitrogen gas. The execution proceeded despite a plea for clemency from the victim's son, Will Berry, who had publicly forgiven West and argued that taking another life would not bring his family peace. West, in a final statement, expressed remorse and acknowledged the forgiveness he had received from the victim's family. The execution method, which Alabama has used since last year, involves forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen through a gas mask, causing death by oxygen deprivation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a presidential memorandum aimed at creating a strategy to dismantle what he terms organized political violence and domestic terrorism, specifically targeting left-wing groups. The directive empowers a government-wide effort, including the FBI and Treasury Department, to investigate and disrupt the funding networks of these organizations. Critics, including the ACLU, have condemned the move as a dangerous overreach designed to target political opponents and activists under the false label of terrorism. The memorandum follows recent calls from the president for retribution in the wake of violent incidents he has blamed on an organized "terror network."</p>

Councillors are questioning the appropriateness of her access to sensitive council data and whether companies backed by her firm could gain an unfair competitive advantage.

The statement comes ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and amidst growing calls from ultranationalists within Netanyahu's coalition for annexation. This move by the U.S. aligns with increasing international pressure on Israel to avoid such a step, which many world leaders have warned would be legally and politically intolerable. Trump also indicated that a deal regarding the conflict in Gaza was "pretty close," suggesting active U.S. diplomatic engagement in the region.</p>

          <p>A California bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the program content. The legislation was inspired by the experience of a legislative aide whose 8-month-old baby was repeatedly woken up by blaring ads. While a 2010 federal law, the CALM Act, already imposes such limits on broadcast and cable TV, it does not apply to streaming platforms. Because California is such a large market, the bill, if signed into law, would likely compel streaming companies to adopt the standard nationwide rather than creating a separate policy just for the state.</p>
