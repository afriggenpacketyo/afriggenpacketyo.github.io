          <p>David Brooks challenges the populist narrative that America's economic decline is due to neoliberal globalization, arguing that this story is historically inaccurate. He contends that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO, and that the decline in manufacturing jobs is primarily due to increased productivity, not foreign competition. Brooks points out that American economic output per capita significantly exceeds that of many other developed nations. He suggests that the forces driving populism are more about cultural values, immigration, and distrust in leading institutions than economic decline. ()</p>

Women treated with GLP-1s had a lower risk of obesity-related cancer and all-cause mortality compared to those treated with DDP-4 inhibitors.

          <p>A committee of independent advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has unanimously recommended that COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers update their shots to target strains related to the JN.1 variant. Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Novavax should target JN.1-related strains for the next fall and winter vaccines. The recommendation follows data showing that vaccines based on JN.1 strains produce strong protection against newer virus versions. The decision underscores the virus's ongoing evolution and its endemic state. ()</p>
