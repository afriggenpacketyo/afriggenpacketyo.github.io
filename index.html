          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, showcasing him with a red tie and deeper shadowing on his face, a contrast to the earlier portrait from January which featured a blue tie and a brighter illumination. The updated photograph, set against a black backdrop, has already been updated on the White House's website, though details regarding the reason for the update or whether it will replace existing official photographs in federal buildings remain unclear. The previous portrait from Trump's first term showed him smiling broadly in front of an American flag. This change reflects a shift in visual representation by the administration.</p>

          <p>Greg Rosen, the chief of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has resigned, expressing his alarm over President Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 rioters. Rosen believes the pardons send a "terrible message" that political violence is acceptable, which he considers antithetical to a constitutional republic. He oversaw a large team of attorneys handling the criminal cases related to the Capitol riot and noted the Justice Department's high conviction rate in these trials. Rosen will be joining a private law firm, stating that he felt it was time to bring his experience to the private sector to benefit clients facing government scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, are voicing concerns over President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to its potential impact on the national debt. These fiscal hawks are pushing for deeper spending cuts than those proposed in the House-passed bill, complicating its passage in the Senate where Republicans have a narrow margin. While the bill aims to reduce outlays by $1.5 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add $3.1 trillion to the debt. The White House defends the bill, citing an analysis that claims it will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years, and Speaker Mike Johnson maintains the bill will not add to the debt.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine and Russia intensify attacks and engage in a second round of negotiations, the Trump administration is adopting a less prominent role in mediating the conflict. President Trump has not made any immediate public statements regarding Ukraine's recent drone strikes inside Russia. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated Trump's call for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, the administration appears increasingly disengaged due to the lack of progress toward peace. The United States remains disappointed with Russia's demands for a 30-day truce, viewing them as nonstarters, and a bipartisan group of senators is pushing for tougher sanctions on Moscow.</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm that was anticipated to generate vibrant displays of the northern lights across a significant portion of the United States proved to be weaker than initially predicted. This caused disappointment for skywatchers who had hoped to witness the aurora borealis. The forecast had raised expectations for colorful streaks of light, but the actual intensity of the storm did not meet those predictions. As a result, the anticipated spectacle was not as widespread or visually impressive as many had hoped.</p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election experienced a significantly low turnout, with nearly 90% of voters abstaining, marking one of the lowest participation rates in any federal election since the country transitioned to democracy. This has fueled concerns about the legitimacy and public support for the elected judges. The poor turnout raises questions about the mandate and effectiveness of the newly elected judiciary.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by her remarks about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst responded to a concerned constituent by saying, "Well, we're all going to die," which Scholten criticized as lacking leadership. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly concerning Iowa soybean farmers. While Iowa's House seats are competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates a widespread decline in childhood measles vaccination rates across the United States since before the COVID-19 pandemic, with significant variations within states. MMR vaccination rates decreased from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year in 33 states. This decline occurs amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with 1,088 cases reported as of May 30, with 96% of those cases being unvaccinated or having unknown vaccination status. Experts say that achieving herd immunity requires a vaccination rate of over 95% in a community.</p>

          <p>Recent incidents involving the Trump administration targeting Congress through law enforcement actions have raised concerns about the legislative branch's capacity to defend its powers. Republicans appear unwilling to challenge Trump, while Democrats struggle to exert political influence. The executive branch has been accused of attacking Congress's independence by pressuring regulatory agencies and circumventing the power of the purse. Congress's legislative productivity has declined over the years, leading to increased deference to the executive branch, and the attacks on Congress pose a threat to the balance of power and citizens' rights.</p>

The ruling prevents the government from deporting individuals accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua under the 1798 law. This decision adds to a complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states reaching different conclusions. The Supreme Court has also weighed in, stating that the government must provide individuals with an opportunity to challenge their deportation under the law.</p>

          <p>The State Department has instructed U.S. embassies and consulates to increase vetting for all visa applicants seeking to enter Harvard University, including students, faculty, and visitors. This measure aims to identify individuals with a history of anti-Semitic harassment and violence, serving as a pilot for expanded screening of visa applicants generally. The State Department may also request applicants to make their social media accounts public for vetting purposes. This action follows accusations that Harvard has failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism, as well as recent attempts by the administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students and receive federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration remains confident that the Alaska LNG project, a massive liquified natural gas initiative, will attract investors despite its $40 billion price tag. President Trump has prioritized the project, pushing Japan and South Korea to invest, while Energy Secretary Chris Wright believes financing will be straightforward if commercial offtakers are secured. The project aims to build an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet, where gas would be cooled and shipped to U.S. allies in Asia. Defense Department support has been pledged to support the project with its resources.</p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Colorado petrol bomb attack, has been charged with 16 counts of attempted murder following an attack on a rally in support of Israeli hostages.

Experts attribute the low participation to factors such as the election being off-year, the balloting process being new and convoluted, and the vast majority of contenders being unknown. Critics labeled the vote a "Black Sunday," and the end of judicial independence and of Mexicoâ€™s system of checks and balances.</p>
