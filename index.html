          <p>With the deadline approaching for negotiating worldwide trade agreements, the United States is considering introducing region-based tariffs instead of individual country rates, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The Trump administration aims to strike deals with key trading partners using reciprocal tariffs imposed in April. Bessent indicated a focus on regional deals like "this is the rate for Central America, this is the rate for this part of Africa," while emphasizing 18 important trading relationships. The negotiating leverage involves reverting to pre-pause tariff rates if partners do not negotiate in good faith, impacting countries like India, Japan, and South Korea. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The cancer was detected after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate, and is characterized by a Gleason score of 9. Despite the aggressive nature of the cancer, doctors believe it is hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Political figures from both sides of the aisle, including President Trump, Vice President Harris, and President Obama, have expressed their support and well wishes for Biden's recovery.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Mexican officials are investigating the circumstances surrounding an accident in which a Mexican Navy ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, causing the deaths of two crew members and injuring at least 22 others. The ship's masts struck the underside of the bridge, and the incident occurred after the ship departed Pier 17 in Manhattan, reportedly due to mechanical issues. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for a thorough investigation, questioning the role of a tugboat that was present and whether cuts to the Coast Guard's staffing played a role in the accident. The Cuauht√©moc, a training vessel, was en route to Iceland after departing from Acapulco in April.</p>

          <p>A three-day NJ Transit strike has concluded after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal, but train service will not resume until Tuesday to allow for inspections.

The agreement is described as fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made through a work rule. Details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but the strike stemmed from disputes over pay and cost of living adjustments.</p>

          <h2>Economist Suggests Yuan Could Rival Dollar If China Improves Accessibility</h2>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China's yuan has the potential to compete with the U.S. dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, suggests that China must deepen its financial markets and create new yuan-backed asset classes. This would allow foreigners to better access yuan-denominated stocks and bonds. Khor cites China's existing "connect" schemes with Hong Kong as a potential model for further financial integration.</p>

          <p>Federal agents are intensifying efforts to combat child sexual exploitation, including a surge in sextortion cases, but face challenges due to public reluctance to discuss the issue. The Justice Department has launched "Operation Restore Justice," resulting in numerous arrests and increased public awareness. Child safety experts emphasize the need to remove the stigma around conversations about child sexual abuse to better protect children. The FBI is seeing an upward trend in risks to children due to advancements in AI technology and the pervasiveness of certain phone apps.</p>
