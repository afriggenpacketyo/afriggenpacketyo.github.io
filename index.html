          <p>Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) democracies convened in Canada to discuss global trade, navigating disagreements arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral actions. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized the need for cooperation and economic prosperity in a divided world, though Trump's stance diverged from his counterparts. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stressed the importance of a free, fair, and rules-based economic order, advocating for the strengthening of multilateral trade through the World Trade Organization. The summit also addressed regional affairs, including the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, where China's military activity is a concern.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" to fund his second-term agenda is creating potential conflict with the House, as some Senate Republicans raise concerns about the legislation. Senators Ron Johnson and Josh Hawley expressed worries about the bill's impact on the deficit and rural hospitals, respectively, while Senator Rand Paul is expected to oppose it due to the increase in the federal debt limit. Key sticking points include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and tax provisions, with the Senate proposing a lower child tax credit than the House. Despite these objections, Senate Majority Leader John Thune remains optimistic about passing the bill, though House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned against making significant changes.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump decided to cut his trip to the G7 summit short due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly the conflict between Israel and Iran. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also curtailed his trip, with Trump stating he needed to return to Washington as soon as possible, and he also posted on Truth Social, suggesting that everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. This decision followed reports of Iranians evacuating their capital city, though officials clarified that the U.S. remains in a defensive posture. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. aims to be strong in pursuit of a peace deal, signaling a focus on peace through strength and America First policies.</p>

Trump's exit disrupts G7 organizers' plans to discuss the Middle East and seek U.S. support for a de-escalation statement. The U.S. has not directly participated in the conflict, but the USS Nimitz carrier strike group is being redeployed to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has issued a warning about patients filming their medical treatments for platforms like TikTok and Instagram, citing potential risks to both patients and NHS staff. The trade union's annual conference highlighted concerns that such filming can distract staff, create discomfort, and inadvertently publicize private medical data of other individuals in the hospital. One radiographer recounted an instance where a patient's relative began filming during treatment setup, while another reported a patient covertly recording her for a cancer blog.

The LAPD has spent $16.9 million, with $11.7 million going towards overtime, and an additional $780,601 was used to repair damage at City Hall and other city buildings. These costs are straining L.A.'s finances, already affected by increasing legal payouts and decreasing tax revenues, and the LAPD has arrested 575 people since the demonstrations began.

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced a bill to prohibit law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while on duty, with exceptions for SWAT teams and medical reasons. The proposal aims to increase transparency and accountability, particularly in response to concerns about masked federal officers during immigration raids. Supporters argue that hiding faces makes officers appear disconnected from the community and shields them from scrutiny, while opponents, including the Department of Homeland Security, claim the bill endangers officers by making them identifiable. The bill would also encourage officers to wear visible identification on their uniforms, and the California Police Chiefs Assn. has expressed a desire to discuss safety concerns.</p>

This shift aims to improve interoperability with partner nations through standardized maintenance and joint training, as well as to achieve economies of scale for domestic production.

          <p>Senate Republicans have released details of their version of President Trump's tax bill, revealing key differences from the House-passed version, particularly concerning Medicaid and state and local tax (SALT) deductions.

These discrepancies have sparked opposition from both sides, with House Republicans threatening to vote against the bill if the SALT cap is not raised, and some Senate Republicans expressing concern over the Medicaid changes.

At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries.

          <p>Panama initiated its journey in Group C of the CONCACAF Gold Cup 2025 with a commanding 5-2 triumph over Guadeloupe at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. The Panamanian squad, having reached the final in 2023, demonstrates its ambition to contend for the championship once more. Coach Thomas Christiansen has been instrumental in elevating the team's stature, guiding them to the final of the Nations League earlier in the year. Panama swiftly established its dominance, scoring four goals within the first 22 minutes, and despite Guadeloupe's efforts to narrow the gap, Panama secured the victory with a late goal.</p>

          <p>A Detroit Police Department sergeant, Shannon Jones, initiated Operation UNITED to exhume unidentified crime victims buried in "paupers' graves" and use DNA analysis to identify them and provide closure to their families. Inspired by photographs of missing loved ones, Jones partnered with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen to launch the project, which has resulted in 33 positive identifications. The operation involves exhuming remains, extracting DNA, and comparing it to online databases and samples from relatives. One case involved Kristina Morris, whose father disappeared in 1995 and was later identified through Operation UNITED, leading to an active homicide investigation.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China has seen a surge in tourism, leading to the growth of a cottage industry centered around traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu). Tourists are increasingly spending time dressing up in elaborate costumes for photoshoots at historical sites, creating opportunities for costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers. This trend aligns with government efforts to promote traditional culture and express national confidence. The tourism industry in Xian generated significant income last year, and this sector provides new employment avenues for young people, offering a potentially stable career path.</p>

The sisters reported abuse by their father, a church warden, and a curate, but the Church never investigated, and police missed opportunities to investigate. An independent review found that the initial disclosures were poorly handled, and the Church's response fell short of today's standards. While the police have apologized and agreed to reinvestigate if new evidence emerges, the sisters express disappointment and frustration with the Church's lack of transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>Social media and video networks have overtaken traditional TV channels and news websites as the main source of news in the U.S., according to research from the Reuters Institute.

This trend presents a challenge for traditional publishers, as politicians increasingly favor sympathetic online hosts over mainstream interviewers. Despite their popularity, online influencers and politicians are also identified as major sources of false or misleading information, and the usage of X for news is stable or increasing, particularly among right-leaning audiences.</p>

          <p>A coalition of press rights organizations is suing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) over its treatment of journalists covering protests against President Trump's immigration crackdown. The lawsuit alleges that LAPD officers have used excessive force against journalists, including firing foam projectiles and tear gas, and have violated state laws protecting journalists' rights. The suit cites instances of officers ignoring press credentials and blocking journalists from areas where they had a right to be. The LAPD has declined to comment on the pending litigation, but the suit follows similar actions taken after the 2020 protests, resulting in settlements and injunctions.</p>

Arias was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to create a singable Spanish version of the national anthem, and her story remained largely unknown until her grandson discovered her drafts in 2006.
