          <p>A memorial sculpture park is planned in Piedmont, California, to honor Sidney and Irene Dearing, the first Black family to own a home in the city. In 1924, the Dearing family faced intense racism, including violence and threats, leading them to sell their home back to the city for their safety. The memorial project, initiated in 2020, aims to acknowledge and address this dark chapter in Piedmont's history. Artist Walter Hood's design will feature portals and a symbolic mailbox to represent the couple's unrealized life in the community, with the city committed to confronting its past and fostering a more inclusive future. The memorial is expected to be completed within the next 12 months.</p>

Tanden's nomination to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget was previously withdrawn due to bipartisan criticism. Several other former Biden senior aides are expected to be interviewed in the coming weeks, and Dr. Kevin Oâ€™Connor, Bidenâ€™s former White House physician, will appear under subpoena in July.</p>

          <p>Two European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a wildlife park near Exeter, leading to the park's evacuation. The bears made their way to the honey store and consumed a week's worth of honey before being secured. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, responded, and police were notified, with the bears remaining calm and not breaching any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of enclosure damage, and the park has since reopened.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after President Donald Trump suggested that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran. Brent crude fell by 5.68% to $67.42 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 5.66% to $64.63 a barrel. This announcement signals a potential easing of the U.S.'s maximum pressure campaign on Iran, particularly following a ceasefire with Israel. Trump's statement has led investors to believe that the risk of a major supply disruption in the Middle East is low, contributing to the price drop.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety, while immigration lawyers expressed concern for the migrants' safety. The court fight stems from efforts to deport migrants to countries other than their origin, with concerns raised about the potential for violence and persecution in those countries.</p>

          <p>Amanda Precourt transformed an old 1940s fortune cookie factory in Denver into an art gallery called the Cookie Factory, which opened to the public in May. The privately funded space aims to provide a place for healing and mental wellness through art. The inaugural exhibition features work by artist Sam Falls, created in Colorado's Yampa River Valley, with a focus on nature and poetry. Precourt hopes the Cookie Factory will serve as a community gathering place to discuss important subjects elicited by art.</p>

          <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene criticized President Trump's missile strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, arguing that the US involvement wastes resources. However, her constituents in Georgia's 14th district generally expressed support for Trump's decision, citing Iran as a threat. Greene's district is highly conservative, and while some voters find her extreme, they generally align with Trump's policies. Many conservative voters hold Christian Zionist views, believing that supporting Israel aligns with their religious beliefs and the fulfillment of biblical prophecies.</p>

          <p>The head of the United Nations agency supporting Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, has condemned the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), calling it a "death trap." His statement follows reports from the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health that 79 people were killed in the territory, with 51 deaths occurring near GHF sites. Lazzarini stressed the need for humanitarian principles to be reinstated and for experienced organizations like UNRWA to provide assistance with respect and dignity. The GHF has pushed back against allegations of attacks near aid distribution sites and claims that the Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are proposing a bill that would force the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to sell its new electric vehicle (EV) mail trucks and cancel the contract for remaining deliveries. The bill aims to cut costs and shift USPS's focus from environmental initiatives to mail delivery. However, the Senate parliamentarian found that the provision violates the Byrd Rule, and the USPS argues that selling the EVs would cost more than replacing them. The USPS also highlights that the potential for raising money at auction is negligible due to the specialized design of the vehicles and the underground electrical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The conflict in the Middle East has prompted many maritime insurance underwriters to avoid offering coverage to vessels with perceived U.S., Israeli, or U.K. links. Insurance rates for vessels that are able to obtain coverage in the region have risen significantly, ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% of ship value. The increased rates and reluctance to offer coverage reflect concerns about potential risks, including the possibility of ships being blocked or trapped by Iran. The market remains volatile, with underwriters closely monitoring political developments and adjusting pricing accordingly.</p>

          <p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency is arresting an increasing number of immigrants without criminal histories, according to federal data. As of mid-June, over 11,700 people in immigration detention had no record of being charged with or convicted of a crime, representing a significant increase since the start of Trump's second term. This trend contradicts assertions that the agency is prioritizing the pursuit of criminals, with nearly a third of all people arrested by Ice having no criminal history. Despite claims of targeting "violent" offenders, data indicates that most crimes were misdemeanors, not violent felonies.</p>

          <p>There are several common tax debt mistakes that can lead to significant financial penalties. These include assuming the debt is too small to matter, ignoring letters from the IRS, thinking you have to pay the debt all at once, and not filing just because you can't pay. Hiring the wrong kind of help and believing bankruptcy will wipe out all tax debt are also common pitfalls. Avoiding these mistakes and understanding available payment options and resources can help taxpayers manage their tax debt effectively. (not investment advice)</p>
