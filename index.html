          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that Germany is prepared to purchase additional U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to send to Ukraine. The pledge was made at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome amidst ongoing Russian aerial bombardments of Ukrainian cities. Merz stated he has urged the U.S. to facilitate the delivery of more systems, sending a clear message of sustained support for Ukraine to both Russia and the United States. The advanced Patriot system is critical for intercepting ballistic missiles and aircraft.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget Director, Russell Vought, has accused Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell of gross mismanagement. The accusation centers on a renovation of the Fed's headquarters, which Vought claims is significantly over budget and features ostentatious elements that Powell allegedly misrepresented to Congress. This public criticism represents a new front in the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with the central bank and its chairman over economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers to power AI and online services is facing local opposition in rural areas like Georgia due to significant environmental concerns. Residents report issues such as disrupted private wells and water contamination from construction runoff. These facilities require millions of gallons of water for cooling, raising alarms about sustainability as one study estimates AI-driven data centers could consume 1.7 trillion gallons globally by 2027. Tech companies state they are investing in water-saving and replenishment initiatives.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously upheld a civil jury's verdict that found Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The ruling affirms the $5 million in damages awarded to Carroll in the May 2023 trial. The court found no errors in the original trial's proceedings that would warrant a new one. This case is distinct from a second, larger defamation verdict of $83.3 million against Trump, which is also currently under appeal.</p>

He warned that Mamdani's rise provides a political "gift" to the GOP, which can use his views to brand the entire Democratic party as extreme.</p>

This combination of predictable income sources helps manage budget, taxes, and market risks, providing invaluable peace of mind throughout retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
