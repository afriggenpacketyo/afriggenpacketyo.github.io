          <p>A major manhunt is underway in Paris for four suspects who stole "priceless" French crown jewels from the Louvre Museum in a daring daylight robbery. The thieves, disguised as construction workers, used a truck with a mobile lift to access a second-floor gallery, smashing display cases and escaping on motorbikes in approximately seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the act as an attack on the nation's heritage, vowing to recover the stolen items, which include pieces from the collections of Queen Marie-Amelie and Empress Eugenie. The museum remained closed as a large-scale investigation involving about 60 detectives commenced.</p>

          <p>Following a reportedly tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former President Donald Trump has publicly suggested that Ukraine should end the war by ceding the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia. Trump claimed that Russia already controls most of the territory and warned Zelenskyy that Vladimir Putin would "destroy" Ukraine otherwise. The meeting, described by sources as a "shouting match," concluded without a U.S. commitment for the long-range Tomahawk missiles Kyiv sought. Trump also announced plans for a summit with Putin in Hungary, raising concerns among analysts about a potential shift in U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Monday caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally, including Disney+, Reddit, and various banking and airline platforms. AWS attributed the problem to an "operational issue" in one of its main data centers and reported it was working on multiple paths to accelerate recovery. While the company later stated the issue was "fully mitigated" with services showing signs of recovery, the event highlighted the fragility of global technology infrastructure. A cybersecurity expert noted the incident appeared to be a technical fault rather than a cyberattack, underscoring the need for business resilience.</p>

          <p>A weekend ceasefire in Gaza was tested after Israel launched an assault in response to an attack on its troops, with both sides accusing the other of violations. In the U.S., a government shutdown is entering its 20th day with no end in sight, as Democrats block a stopgap bill, demanding an extension of healthcare subsidies. Meanwhile, international tensions have risen as the U.S. plans to halt subsidies to Colombia and implement new tariffs after its leader criticized U.S. counternarcotics operations that involved destroying boats from Venezuela. U.S. envoys are heading to Israel to help get the ceasefire back on track.</p>

          <p>The Afghanistan women's refugee football team, now based primarily in Australia, is in a state of uncertainty after their entry visas to the United Arab Emirates were repeatedly rejected, jeopardizing their first FIFA-recognized match since fleeing the Taliban. The team was scheduled to play in a tournament in Dubai, but the rejections have left the players feeling abandoned and disillusioned. A human rights lawyer assisting the team suggests the visa issue may be political, given the UAE is one of the few countries to recognize the Taliban government. The situation highlights the ongoing struggles faced by the athletes who defied the Taliban's oppressive rules against women in sports.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump strongly condemned Virginia's Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, calling him an "animal" for past text messages in which Jones fantasized about shooting a Republican lawmaker. Speaking to reporters, Trump asserted that anyone else would be "put in prison" for such remarks and questioned how Jones is allowed to run for office. The controversy stems from 2022 texts where Jones imagined shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and referred to his children as "fascists." Jones has since apologized for the messages, but the issue continues to be a focal point in the Virginia political landscape.</p>

          <p>China and Australia are trading blame following a mid-air incident over the South China Sea where a Chinese PLA jet released flares near an Australian patrol aircraft. Australia's defence ministry lodged a complaint about the "unsafe and unprofessional" maneuvers, expressing concerns to Beijing. In response, a spokesperson for the PLA Southern Theatre Command accused the Australian aircraft of intruding into airspace over the Paracel Islands, which China calls the Xisha Islands. The spokesperson stated that the PLA forces took necessary countermeasures and warned Australia to cease its "provocations," highlighting the ongoing military tensions in the region.</p>

Circadian biologists warn that this lack of a natural light-dark cycle can lead to serious health issues, including heart disease, depression, and a weakened immune system.

However, challenges persist, including demand headwinds, stress in subprime auto lending, and uncertainty from a government shutdown. Automakers face a balancing act, with third-quarter earnings expected to decline but remain profitable as the industry adapts to new economic realities and a pullback in EV adoption.

This marks the first time in James's 23-season career that he will miss a season opener, placing immediate focus on the partnership with Dončić, who recently signed a three-year contract extension. While James, now 40, is in the final year of his contract, the team dynamic will test the leadership of Dončić and the supporting cast. Coach JJ Redick has yet to finalize a starting lineup, but the team's success will initially depend on its ability to perform without its veteran superstar.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce new vocational qualifications called "V-levels" for 16-year-olds in England, intended to replace Level 3 BTECs and other technical courses. The initiative aims to simplify what ministers describe as a "confusing landscape" of post-16 education options, providing a clear vocational path alongside A-levels and T-levels. Additionally, a new "stepping stone" qualification will be introduced to reduce the number of students repeatedly resitting GCSE maths and English. While the government says the move will create better career routes, some educational associations have warned that V-levels may not adequately fill the gap left by the established BTEC qualifications.</p>

These systems are adept at playing a role and responding to user cues, creating a powerful "social illusion."

          <p>A food writer embarks on a quest in Paris to find the perfect jambon beurre, the classic French sandwich of ham and butter on a baguette. After trying a highly-publicized version that proved disappointing after an hour-long wait, the critic finds an exceptional sandwich at a small, recommended shop called Caractère de Cochon. The article celebrates the intoxicating simplicity and balance of just three high-quality ingredients: a crusty baguette, creamy French butter, and flavorful ham. The author concludes by offering Los Angeles readers a guide to sourcing local ingredients to recreate a similarly world-class sandwich at home, proving culinary excellence can be found anywhere.</p>

          <p>The theater is grappling with existential questions about humanity through plays that feature artificial intelligence, using the technology as a new prism to explore age-old themes. Lauren Gunderson's "anthropology" portrays a woman who creates an AI replica of her deceased sister from her digital footprint, questioning whether a person is merely the sum of their data. Similarly, Jordan Harrison's "Marjorie Prime" uses android-like "primes" as therapeutic companions for the bereaved, blurring the lines between human and software. These works examine how AI magnifies human traits and challenges our understanding of memory, consciousness, and what it means to be human in an increasingly digitalized world.</p>

          <p>A new longitudinal study by the Trevor Project reveals a significant decline in the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth over a one-year period, amid a contentious political climate. The findings show sharp increases in the proportion of participants reporting symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The study also found a doubling in the number of youths who faced pressure to undergo "conversion therapy," a discredited and harmful practice. While there were some positive signs, such as increased support from friends, many participants reported avoiding professional care due to cost or fear of stigma, highlighting an urgent need for accessible mental health services.</p>

          <p>Following California's worst flu season in years, state health officials are warning that the upcoming fall and winter could be similarly severe. Troubling signs include an early and intense flu season already underway in parts of Asia and continued lower-than-ideal flu vaccine uptake in the U.S. Last season saw the highest number of pediatric flu deaths nationally since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with a rare and severe brain complication also reported in children. Experts are urging residents to get vaccinated against the flu, as well as COVID-19 and RSV, to mitigate the potential impact of another challenging respiratory virus season.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles city officials have declared eight properties in Pacific Palisades, including a mansion used for filming the HBO show "Succession," as public nuisances for failing to clear hazardous fire debris. The Board of Building and Safety Commissioners voted that the remaining ash and rubble could pose a public health risk and pressured owners to clean up their lots. Owners who do not comply face the possibility of the city hiring a contractor to perform the cleanup and then billing them for the work. The decision affects property owners who either opted out of a federal debris removal program or were deemed ineligible for it.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine Corps live-fire exercise at Camp Pendleton is under investigation after an artillery round exploded mid-air, sending shrapnel onto Interstate 5 and striking a parked California Highway Patrol cruiser. The incident occurred during a demonstration for the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, which had prompted state officials to close a 17-mile stretch of the freeway due to safety concerns. No one was injured, but the event has raised serious questions about the decision to fire live munitions over a major public highway. The demonstration was cut short after the premature detonation, and state and federal officials are now examining the chain of events that led to the dangerous mishap.</p>

The pact's first pillar involves Australia purchasing three Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. and then collaborating on a new design. The second pillar focuses on sharing advanced military capabilities like hypersonic missiles and AI among the three allies. While the review has caused some concern, officials in the U.K. and Australia have downplayed fears, describing it as a normal process for a new administration.</p>

Dyche, the former manager of Everton and Burnley, has emerged as the leading candidate, with the club hoping to finalize a deal on Monday. The move comes as Forest sits 18th in the league table with only one win in eight games. Postecoglou's tenure was the shortest in Premier League history, lasting just 39 days. Dyche's pragmatic coaching style is seen as a better fit for the current squad than Postecoglou's approach.</p>

Giuffre, a prominent accuser who took her own life earlier this year, provides a harrowing account of the sex-trafficking network operated by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has explicitly stated that the 2020 Brexit deal has compounded the country's long-term economic productivity challenges, in remarks made to an international committee at the IMF. Quoting the Office for Budget Responsibility's estimate of a 4% long-term negative impact on the economy, Reeves signaled a significant shift in the government's rhetoric on the issue. This change in emphasis is expected to be a key part of the government's argument ahead of the upcoming Budget, where tax rises may be necessary to address a downgrade in the UK's long-term productivity forecast, partly attributed to Brexit's effects on trade and investment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from a federal watchdog agency has found that private insurers operating Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid plans often list mental health professionals in their networks who are not actually available to patients. The investigation revealed these "ghost networks" include providers who are retired, no longer work at the listed locations, or do not accept the insurance, with 55% of listed professionals in Medicare Advantage plans being effectively unavailable. This creates significant barriers for vulnerable patients seeking mental health care and raises questions about whether taxpayers are receiving value for the hundreds of billions paid to these private insurers. The report recommends better oversight and a national provider directory.</p>
