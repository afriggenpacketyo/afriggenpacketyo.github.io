        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by Baroness Louise Casey reveals that authorities in England and Wales have avoided addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators in grooming gang cases, leading to significant data gaps. The report indicates that ethnicity data is not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, hindering accurate assessment at a national level. Despite this, local data from Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire suggest a disproportionate number of suspects are of Asian ethnic backgrounds. The report criticizes the fear of being perceived as racist for preventing organizations from addressing the issue, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper apologized to victims and announced a national inquiry, saying that ignoring the issues allows the criminality and depravity of a minority of men to be used to marginalise whole communities.</p>

Auto loan rates are fixed but rising car prices, potentially exacerbated by Trump's trade policy, are increasing payments. Federal student loan rates are set annually, shielding borrowers from immediate Fed moves, but forgiveness options are diminishing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei would end, not escalate, the conflict between Israel and Iran. He defended Israel's actions as necessary to eliminate Iran's nuclear program, dismissing reports that Iran is seeking to end hostilities and resume negotiations. Netanyahu emphasized the importance of supporting Israel in combating what he described as a threat to the entire world. He also dismissed criticism from those opposing U.S. military support for Israel's strikes against Iran, stating that the country is a threat to the entire world.</p>

The fighting led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, with the State Department issuing a directive to embassies emphasizing the U.S. is not involved in Israel's unilateral actions.</p>

Despite Iran's missile capabilities, Israel's actions have diminished the threat from its allies, though the risk of regional escalation remains.
