          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has generated significant controversy with a musical advertisement portraying the U.K. as a country in economic decline, plagued by strikes and a cost-of-living crisis. The ad, which suggests crypto is a solution, was praised by some in the tech and venture capital sectors who agreed with its critical premise. However, it also drew widespread criticism from the British public and commentators who labeled it as misleading and self-promotional. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between the crypto industry and traditional financial systems and regulators.</p>

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a trade body for the UK car finance industry, has labeled the Financial Conduct Authority's proposed redress scheme for mis-selling as "completely impractical." The primary concern is the scheme's retroactive scope, which could cover loans dating back to 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack necessary paperwork. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that found hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful but left room for claims in cases of particularly large commissions. The financial regulator will consult on the final details of the plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India and the Philippines have conducted their first-ever joint naval exercises in the contested waters of the South China Sea, a move aimed at reinforcing international maritime law. The two-day patrol involved three Indian naval vessels and two Philippine frigates, occurring as Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos departed for a state visit to India. The exercises are a significant step in strengthening military cooperation between the two nations amid rising tensions with Beijing, which claims sovereignty over most of the strategic waterway. Philippine officials reported being shadowed by Chinese vessels during the patrol but noted no untoward incidents occurred.</p>

          <p>India is navigating a delicate diplomatic situation after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff and an unspecified "penalty" over its continued importation of discounted Russian oil. Since the war in Ukraine, Russia has become India's top oil supplier, a trade relationship that New Delhi has defended as necessary for stabilizing global energy prices. Indian officials have remained noncommittal about halting these purchases, stating decisions are based on market prices and the global situation. The threat marks a significant shift from the previous U.S. administration's more tolerant stance, creating international uncertainty.</p>

Despite its own civil war, Yemen remains a critical transit point for migrants on the perilous "Eastern Route" hoping to find work in wealthy Gulf nations. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly shipwrecks highlighting the extreme dangers faced by migrants in the region.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 600 retired Israeli security officials, including former heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet intelligence agencies, has sent a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump. They are urging him to use his influence to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza. The letter asserts that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel and that the focus should be on returning hostages and alleviating the humanitarian crisis. This appeal comes amid reports that Netanyahu is considering expanding military operations, a move that has also drawn criticism from hostages' families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of Africa's political and economic elites frequently travel abroad for medical treatment, a practice that highlights the underfunding and neglect of public healthcare systems in their own countries. Experts point to a lack of specialized treatments, poorly equipped local hospitals, and an over-reliance on foreign aid as key drivers of this medical tourism. Despite the 2001 Abuja Declaration, where African Union members pledged to allocate 15% of their national budgets to healthcare, most nations have failed to meet this target. This systemic issue results in a cycle of underperforming health services for the general populace.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion article by Doug Schoen posits that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is emerging as a more formidable potential candidate for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination than former Vice President Kamala Harris. The author points to AOC's strong polling numbers, which place her in a virtual tie for the lead when Harris is excluded, and her superior fundraising from small-dollar donors. The piece contrasts this with what it describes as waning enthusiasm and donor fatigue for a potential Harris campaign. It concludes that despite concerns about her progressive ideology, AOC's ability to generate grassroots excitement gives her a more viable path.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's claims that his sweeping tariffs are making America richer, emerging economic data indicates a different reality. The import taxes are contributing to rising inflation, a cooling labor market, and slower GDP growth, creating significant uncertainty for the U.S. and global economies. Economists estimate the average American household could face costs of $2,400 this year, with the full impact yet to be felt. While the tariffs are generating revenue, this income is offset by other policies that increase the national debt. The global economic landscape is also shifting as countries seek new markets, potentially leading to wider protectionism.</p>

Doctors and sports scientists state that unless you are engaged in prolonged, intense exercise or suffering from rapid fluid loss due to illness, drinking plain water is sufficient for hydration.

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour has offered a glimpse into the tactical and cultural changes being implemented by new manager Ruben Amorim.

Amorim has also fostered a more relaxed environment, treating players with adult responsibility while maintaining high standards through on-field accountability. While these early signs are positive, the manager acknowledges that the true test will be delivering consistent results once the Premier League season begins.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing workers at facilities in Missouri and Illinois have gone on strike after rejecting a new labor agreement. The union members, who build F-15 fighter jets and other military aircraft, voted down a four-year contract offer from the aerospace giant. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) stated the strike is about securing a contract that reflects the workers' skill and dedication to national defense. This walkout represents another significant challenge for Boeing, which has been grappling with production issues, safety crises, and a separate, costly strike by its passenger plane workers last year.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic state legislators from office if they do not return after fleeing the state to block a vote on new congressional maps. Dozens of Democrats left Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a redistricting plan heavily favored by the GOP and backed by Donald Trump. Abbott has given the lawmakers a deadline to return, citing a legal opinion that suggests they could forfeit their offices. In response, the Democrats issued a defiant statement, escalating a political showdown over gerrymandering that has drawn national attention.</p>

          <p>A manhunt has entered its fourth day for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities believe the suspect, who was a regular at the bar and knew the victims, is still armed and dangerous. The search involves multiple local, state, and federal agencies scouring the rugged mountain terrain where Brown is known to have camped and hunted. The victims were identified as four local residents, and the small, tight-knit community has been shaken by the seemingly unprovoked act of violence.</p>

          <p>BYD, China's largest electric vehicle manufacturer, posted its first monthly drop in deliveries this year, a sign of the intense competition from an ongoing price war in the EV market. The company shipped 341,030 units in July, down from over 377,000 in June, after it had heavily discounted several models. Other major Chinese EV makers like Li Auto and Nio also reported declines, though some, including Xpeng and Xiaomi, saw month-over-month growth. The fierce price competition has become so widespread that it has prompted warnings from top policymakers in Beijing to curb excessive rivalry.</p>

Ong admitted to helping former transportation minister Subramaniam Iswaran cover up evidence related to expensive gifts, including a private jet trip, that Ong had given him. While the maximum penalty is seven years in jail, prosecutors and defense lawyers have recommended a fine instead, citing Ong's poor health from a rare bone marrow cancer.

          <p>UBS has agreed to pay $300 million to resolve outstanding U.S. consumer relief obligations stemming from the mis-selling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) by Credit Suisse.

The settlement is part of UBS's broader strategy to quickly and fairly resolve the legal and financial liabilities it inherited following its acquisition of Credit Suisse.

          <p>A BBC Sport analysis suggests that Manchester City's most significant summer acquisition might not be a player, but rather Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former right-hand man at Liverpool. The hiring of Lijnders, a coach known for a high-octane, counter-pressing style, indicates that manager Pep Guardiola may be planning a major tactical evolution. As opponents have adapted to City's traditional positional play, Guardiola has acknowledged that modern football is more about rhythm and transitions. The article argues that recent player signings also point towards a more direct, dynamic style of play, signaling a potential shift in the team's core philosophy.</p>

          <p>New outbreaks of violence have rocked Syria at two separate flashpoints, threatening a delicate ceasefire and challenging the authority of the country's transitional government. In the southern province of Sweida, government-affiliated forces clashed with armed groups from the Druze minority, resulting in at least two deaths. Simultaneously, in the northern Aleppo province, government fighters confronted the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). These incidents undermine ongoing efforts to reintegrate territories and maintain stability following the ousting of former President Bashar Assad, as ethnic and religious minorities remain wary of the new de facto Islamist rule.</p>

The miners were trapped deep inside a shaft on Thursday after a magnitude 4.2 earthquake caused a section of the mine to collapse, which also killed another worker instantly. After three days of drilling through rock, rescue efforts concluded with the tragic discovery. Authorities have launched a criminal investigation to determine if any safety standards were violated and whether mining activity contributed to the tremor.</p>

Ben and Lucy Armstrong had to flee with their three-year-old son and dogs as the blaze, which killed two people and spread over 100 square kilometers, rapidly approached their home. Upon returning, they found only the walls of their house remaining, with sentimental items like wedding mementos completely destroyed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian opinion piece by Nesrine Malik argues that the rise of new political movements on both the left and right is a symptom of a failing political establishment, but it may not lead to meaningful change. Instead, the risk is a "permacrisis" where mainstream parties like Labour govern on inertia, unable to solve major issues while fending off fragmented opposition. This creates a volatile status quo of escalating public rage and impotent government. The author suggests that while establishment institutions are losing public trust, their entrenched power allows them to hold on, leading to a permanent disconnect between rulers and the ruled.</p>
