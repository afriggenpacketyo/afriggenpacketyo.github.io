          <p>Germany and Israel are marking six decades of postwar diplomatic ties, a relationship still complex due to the Holocaust's memory and current tensions in Gaza. Israeli President Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the anniversary with German President Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. The visit occurs during Chancellor Merz's new government, which acknowledges Germany's responsibility for Israel's security. Despite growing criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians maintain Israel's right to defend itself following the Hamas attacks, although the relationship is complicated by the ICC's arrest warrants against Netanyahu. The visit underscores the delicate balance Germany must strike between supporting Israel and upholding international law.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's investments in Africa's energy sector, including renewables, totaled $66 billion, with Africa becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. Exports of Chinese solar and wind tech to Africa surged 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This trend aligns with China's global shift from fossil fuels to renewables, following its 2021 commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.</p>

          <p>President Trump is embarking on his first foreign trip of his second term, touring the Middle East to secure investment, trade, and technology deals from Gulf allies. The trip, similar to his 2017 visit, will focus on negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, covering topics like oil, trade, and regional conflicts, including the Israel-Gaza war and the Iran nuclear program. Trump's primary objective is to prioritize American interests by securing multi-billion dollar deals and investments in the US economy. The lack of a visit to Israel signals a shift in US policy, as the administration aims to renew aid deliveries to Gaza without direct Israeli government involvement.</p>

          <p>Far from the missile strikes grabbing global attention, ordinary Kashmiris are suffering the heaviest toll of renewed conflict between India and Pakistan.

Despite a ceasefire agreement, reports of continued shelling persist, leaving communities in constant fear.

          <p>Koyo Kouoh, a prominent figure in the global art world and slated to be the first African woman to curate the Venice Biennale, passed away at 57 in Switzerland. Kouoh's death, occurring just before her announcement of the Biennale's theme, has left a void in the contemporary art community. As the curator and executive director of Zeitz MOCAA, she championed artists of color and brought the museum back to life after a period of crisis. Throughout her career, Kouoh pushed to bring African artists to a world that had long either ignored them or typecast them.</p>

Drummond, who initially lost over 50 pounds in 2021, found herself needing to restart her plan at the end of 2023. She is now focusing on building muscle through exercises like lunges and deadlifts, while also increasing her protein intake. Drummond is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying instead on the awareness she gained from her previous efforts and she is using the Happy Scale app to track her progress.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China are meeting in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from the trade war initiated by President Trump.

While Trump suggested he would be open to lowering tariffs, the White House indicated that China would need to make concessions for any reduction.

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues against the idea of a perfect mother, stating that it can be harmful to both mothers and children. She emphasizes that flaws are an essential part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections and understand that relationships are not one-way. Dr. Ross criticizes the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, highlighting the importance of recognizing and appreciating the efforts of mothers, and the author also provides a quiz to show mothers that they are good enough.</p>

Harry's comments, made in a BBC interview, have drawn attention back to the rift that began in 2020 when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from royal duties. Some royal observers warn that unless Charles can heal this division, it could define his reign and undermine the messages of unity and tolerance he has long championed. The situation is further complicated by Prince Andrew's continued exile due to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, placing greater public responsibility on Prince William.</p>

          <p>President Trump has floated the idea of renaming the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf, sparking widespread condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum. The name change is viewed as an affront to Iranian national and cultural identity. The Persian Gulf has been known by that name since at least 550 B.C., and is deeply intertwined with Iranian history. While Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names used by the U.S. government, this move has angered Iranians and may affect ongoing nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pushing for Europe to buy more American farm products, but European officials are calling food safety standards a "red line." The U.S. wants Europe to buy more American gas and trucks, to change their consumption taxes and to weaken their digital regulations, but European policymakers are not keen on allowing more hormone-raised American steaks and burgers into the European Union. Strict European Union food regulations, including a ban on hormones, govern the European food production, and those rules could turn into a trade-war sticking point.</p>

          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become an unlikely political influencer due to his strong support for President Trump, despite facing hostility at home. Boassen's idolization of Trump has won him friends in Washington, leading to a new career advocating for closer U.S.-Greenland ties and pushing for Greenland's independence from Denmark. He has cultivated contacts in Greenland's government and works for an organization promoting U.S.-Greenland relations. While Trump wants to claim Greenland for the United States, Boassen is pushing instead for a tight security alliance between an independent Greenland and Washington.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba has voiced concerns about cutting the consumption tax to alleviate inflation, citing the potential strain on state finances. Senior officials in his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have dismissed the idea as the government seeks an economic package before the House of Councillors election. While opposition parties support a consumption tax cut, Ishiba emphasized the need for thorough discussions and alternative ways to support those in need. He also addressed tariff negotiations with the United States, seeking a complete abolition of additional duties on Japanese exports.</p>

Trump expressed a desire to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both countries. In retaliation to Trump's tariffs, China has imposed a minimum 125 percent duty rate on imported U.S. goods and restricted exports of critical minerals.</p>
