Now in England playing for London Spirit in The Hundred, Warner also reflected on the warm reception he received from English fans during his final Ashes appearance in 2023.

          <p>A review of recent economic data presents a complex and chaotic picture of the U.S. economy during the Trump administration, challenging claims of a consistent boom. While headline GDP figures showed growth in the second quarter, the first six months of the year saw mediocre expansion, and private investment has fallen. The article highlights wild swings in trade, with imports surging and then tumbling in response to tariff policies, and notes that job creation has stalled unexpectedly. The Federal Reserve has maintained interest rates, citing uncertainty and stubborn inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Psychological Reasons Behind Awkwardness When Receiving Compliments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the common discomfort people feel when receiving compliments, explaining that the reaction can reveal a person's self-perception and impact the giver's feelings. Social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao discuss the science behind this social dynamic. They argue that accepting praise gracefully is a valuable social skill that many struggle with due to underlying insecurities or a fear of appearing arrogant. The piece makes a case for learning to embrace kind remarks from others, framing it as a positive social interaction for both parties involved.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A notable pattern has emerged in President Trump's second term, where world leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery as a key diplomatic tool. Examples include the U.K. Prime Minister offering an unprecedented second state visit and the Israeli Prime Minister nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Analysts suggest this approach stems from a recognition that dealing directly and appealing to Trump's desire to be seen as a winner is the most effective way to achieve their goals. This marks a shift from his first term, where leaders were more skeptical and often tried to work through his advisors.</p>

          <p>Japan's meteorological agency has confirmed that the country experienced its hottest July since record-keeping began in 1898, with the average temperature 2.89 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average.

The unusually high temperatures and an early end to the rainy season have also impacted the nation's iconic cherry blossoms. Authorities are urging the public to take precautions against heatstroke and to manage water resources carefully amid lower-than-average rainfall.</p>

Trump claimed without evidence that the numbers were "RIGGED," a move that drew sharp criticism for politicizing official data and was compared to actions in authoritarian countries.

The court's opinion was a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, stating that the government failed to show it would be harmed by an injunction preventing unconstitutional stops. The decision was celebrated by civil rights groups and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as a victory for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>As wildfires affect popular holiday destinations like Greece, Turkey, and France, travel experts are advising tourists on their rights and options. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems it safe to travel to these areas, those with concerns should first contact their airline and hotel for potential solutions. Standard travel insurance policies typically cover cancellations or curtailments only if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, some policies offer extra coverage for natural catastrophes, and travelers whose holidays are cancelled by providers are usually eligible for refunds, regardless of insurance status.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's brand, Skims, has released a new product described as shapewear for the face, sparking both interest and criticism. The £52 mask, which sold out quickly, is marketed to provide a "sculpted" jawline and taps into a TikTok trend of extreme bedtime beauty rituals. However, medical professionals state there is no scientific evidence that such wraps provide lasting results and warn of potential skin irritation. Critics argue the product promotes harmful beauty ideals and fuels insecurity, particularly among young consumers, by suggesting that even natural facial features need to be altered.</p>

          <p>China's customs administration has tightened import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting hazardous levels of the metal cadmium and the compound alkaline yellow in some shipments. The new rules mandate enhanced pre-export safety checks and require "batch by batch" testing upon arrival, with any non-compliant fruit to be returned or destroyed. Exporters found with unqualified products will face suspension from the Chinese market. The move follows a significant 45% year-on-year drop in the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recent trade deal negotiated between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump is a "capitulation" that harms Europe's credibility and economy. The authors contend the agreement is a one-way street favoring the U.S., leaving key European industries vulnerable and undermining the EU's position as a defender of rules-based trade. They criticize von der Leyen for blinking under pressure and urge EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the lopsided terms. The commentary suggests Europe should have resisted U.S. coercion instead of condoning it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company liable in a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology. The case concerned a driver who, while reportedly distracted, went through an intersection and struck a couple, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' attorney argued that Tesla was negligent for not restricting Autopilot's use to controlled-access highways. Tesla, which plans to appeal, maintains that the driver is solely responsible and that users must remain fully attentive.</p>

          <p>Two men accused of running an illegal cannabis extraction operation in Los Angeles County have been charged with murder following the deaths of five of their workers in two separate incidents. Prosecutors allege that Ted Chien and Han Quan Jiao administered the business, where an explosion in 2023 killed four workers and a fire a year later killed another. The men are accused of continuing their illegal operations even after the fatalities. The case highlights the deadly risks associated with unregulated cannabis labs, with the district attorney condemning the operators for prioritizing greed over safety.</p>
