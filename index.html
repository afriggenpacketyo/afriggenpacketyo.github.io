          <h2>Instagram Implements New Content Restrictions for Teen Users</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta, Instagram's parent company, is introducing new content restrictions for teen users, aligning the platform's content with PG-13 movie ratings to provide a safer experience for users under 18. These changes will automatically place accounts of users under 18 under a 13+ setting and block them from seeing search results for terms like "alcohol" or "gore," and prevent them from following accounts posting age-inappropriate content. The company is also applying these regulations to its AI technology, ensuring AI responses are age-appropriate. Meta hopes these updates will reassure parents that teens are seeing safe content by default, while also giving them more control over their teen's experience. The initiative reflects growing concerns about the impact of social media on young people. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has expressed support for suspending the controversial 2023 pension reforms, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, until after the 2027 presidential election. This decision comes as Lecornu faces crucial votes of no-confidence and seeks the support of Socialist MPs in parliament. Suspending the pension reform would cost the government hundreds of millions of euros in 2026 and 2027. Lecornu's move indicates a potential shift in policy to maintain governmental stability amid political opposition and economic challenges. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is hosting a Gaza reconstruction conference to explore its potential role in the peace process following the latest Israel-Hamas ceasefire, brokered largely by the United States. The conference aims to bring together representatives from businesses, civil society, and governments to plan and coordinate efforts for postwar Gaza. While the UK supports a Palestinian-led recovery, differing visions from the US and Egypt highlight the need for consensus and collaboration among key players. Experts emphasize the importance of including Hamas in discussions and establishing a UN-overseen committee for long-term aid and development. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to revive a lawsuit from Colorado families who claimed their parental rights were violated when their children attended school-sponsored club meetings discussing gender identity and sexuality. The parents alleged that the school district discouraged students from sharing information about these discussions with their parents. Justices Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch expressed concern over courts' reluctance to address whether school districts infringe upon parental rights by encouraging a student's gender transition without parental consent. The families sought monetary damages to cover private school, medical, and counseling expenses. The optimism score for this article is 45.</p>

          <h2>Jamie Dimon Sees Bankruptcies as Warning Sign</h2>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that bankruptcies in the U.S. auto market are a sign that lending standards grew too lax in the past decade-plus. Dimon said that these are early signs there might be some excess out there because of it. JPMorgan managed to dodge losses from First Brands, but it did lend to Tricolor, causing $170 million in chargeoffs in the quarter, said CFO Jeremy Barnum. Chargeoffs happen when a bank recognizes it won't get repaid for loans it made. (not investment advice) The optimism score for this article is 45.</p>

          <p>A CEO shared advice for Gen Z job seekers, noting a divide between their values and hiring managers' expectations. The CEO suggested Gen Z become honest about the amount of money they want and need to feel, "That's enough." The CEO suggests that if landing a job is an urgent priority, and affluence is a long-range one, you may choose to suppress your desire for wellbeing, balance, and authentic self expression for a period of time and embrace achievement and workcentrism. The CEO suggested that it is important to commit for long enough to see results. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>The US government has revoked the visas of at least 50 politicians and government officials in Mexico amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on drug cartels and their suspected political allies. The move has sent quiet shock waves through Mexico’s political elite, who regularly travel to the US. It also marks a significant broadening of US anti-narcotics action, with the Trump administration targeting active politicians usually seen as too diplomatically sensitive.
