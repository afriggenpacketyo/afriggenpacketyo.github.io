          <p>Former President Donald Trump has praised a new directive allowing Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department to share information with federal immigration authorities about individuals encountered during traffic stops. He described the policy as a "great step" and suggested similar measures could be implemented nationwide to address crime. This development occurs in the context of Trump's move to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard, a decision that has drawn criticism from Democrats and is expected to face legal challenges.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in states like Texas by redrawing his own state's congressional maps. By calling a special election, he hopes voters will approve new, Democrat-favoring districts that would only take effect if Republican states proceed with partisan gerrymandering. Newsom framed the move as a necessary response to protect democracy from being undermined, stating that California cannot afford to "unilaterally disarm" in a national political fight over control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer argued that investors should not exit the stock market despite signs of speculative "froth," such as the explosive gains of some recent IPOs. He contrasted the current environment with the dot-com bubble, asserting that today's market has enough rational, high-performing companies like Amazon and Eli Lilly to balance out the irrational exuberance. Cramer believes the strength of these legitimate businesses provides a solid foundation that can withstand the volatility from more speculative assets. (not investment advice)</p>

Commissioners expressed alarm over the impact of sonic booms on residents and wildlife, as well as issues related to public access and natural resources. The decision highlights a regulatory conflict over whether the launches, many of which deploy Starlink satellites, primarily serve commercial purposes or are federal activities exempt from state oversight.</p>

          <p>Ford is undertaking a fundamental overhaul of its manufacturing process to develop more affordable electric vehicles capable of competing with low-cost Chinese models like the Xiaomi SU7. The company announced plans for a new $30,000 electric pickup truck to be built at a retooled Kentucky plant using an "assembly tree" system designed to reduce parts and speed up production. This strategic shift reflects growing concerns among U.S. automakers about the existential threat posed by the advanced technology and competitive pricing of China's EV industry.</p>

          <p>A coalition of prominent religious leaders in Washington, D.C., has strongly criticized President Trump's federal takeover of the city's police force and his dehumanizing rhetoric about its residents. In a joint statement, the clergy rejected what they termed "fear-based governance," arguing that true public safety is achieved through long-term community collaboration and addressing root causes of crime, not through a military presence. They contended that the president's description of the city as a "lawless wasteland" is inaccurate and counterproductive.</p>

          <p>As Social Security marks its 90th anniversary, concerns are growing over its long-term financial stability, with projections indicating its trust funds could be depleted by 2033. Without congressional intervention, the program may only be able to pay a portion of scheduled benefits, a prospect that has spurred several legislative proposals. Bipartisan plans being discussed include creating a new investment fund or increasing payroll taxes on high earners to ensure the program's solvency for future generations of retirees.

          <p>The Department of Justice and the SEC have charged two men in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors out of over $200 million.

Authorities highlighted that the scheme targeted retail investors and military veterans, with one of the accused allegedly continuing to invest client money even after discovering the fraud.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for managing high blood pressure, recommending a more aggressive and earlier start to treatment. If lifestyle changes do not lower blood pressure within three to six months for those in the 130-139 systolic range, medication is now advised. Significantly, the guidelines now recommend abstaining from alcohol entirely, a shift from previous advice that permitted moderate consumption, citing growing evidence of alcohol's negative impact on cardiovascular health.</p>

          <p>From the Ukrainian viewpoint, the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is seen as a repugnant spectacle that legitimizes an aggressor and represents a betrayal by a key ally. Ukrainians are reportedly appalled by what they perceive as naive and cack-handed diplomacy from the Trump administration, which they believe fails to grasp Putin's fundamental goal of denying Ukraine's sovereignty. The fear is that any deal reached in Alaska will ultimately serve Putin's long-term objectives at the expense of Ukraine's existence.</p>

While the operation is a complex military ballet, it is a costly and inefficient last resort compared to overland truck deliveries, which remain largely blocked by Israel. On the ground, the drops often lead to chaos and deadly scrambles, with many displaced and vulnerable Gazans unable to secure any of the desperately needed supplies.</p>

          <p>The upcoming summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is framed by their distinct and contrasting objectives regarding the war in Ukraine. Putin aims to secure international recognition, sideline European leaders, and achieve his territorial ambitions. In contrast, Trump's primary goal appears to be positioning himself as a global peacemaker, a long-held ambition, though his approach has been inconsistent, vacillating between threats and conciliation. The meeting's outcome will depend on how these differing motivations clash or align during their direct negotiations.</p>
