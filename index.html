          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed reservations about the U.S. attacks against Iran, calling them a "massive gamble" by President Trump, referencing historical parallels with past U.S. military actions in the Middle East. Himes highlighted the initial successes in conflicts like Iraq and Libya, but cautioned against premature celebration, citing the long-term costs and unintended consequences. He also voiced concern over the lack of congressional approval for the strikes, emphasizing Congress's constitutional authority to declare war. Himes urged restraint in assessing the situation and cautioned against excessive optimism. The context of the article is the recent US strikes on Iran and the political fallout of these actions.</p>

          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance stated that the US is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself, in response to the recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear installations. While avoiding confirming the complete destruction of Iranian nuclear sites, Vance expressed confidence that the strikes have "substantially delayed" Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. However, an Iranian member of parliament claimed that the Fordo enrichment plant was not seriously damaged, and satellite images suggested that while there was damage, the main support building at the facility remained intact. Nuclear non-proliferation analysts are divided on whether the strikes will lead Iran to negotiate or accelerate its uranium enrichment efforts.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is prepared to engage in diplomatic talks with Iran following the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, emphasizing that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks unless provoked. Rubio cautioned Iran against closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil transit route, deeming such action "suicidal" for the regime due to the potential global backlash. He highlighted that the U.S. military presence in the Middle East is intended to defend American interests and allies against Iranian aggression. Rubio stressed that the next steps depend on Iran's choices, and the U.S. is ready for diplomacy if Iran chooses that path.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from potentially closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. Rubio emphasized China's reliance on the strait for its oil imports, highlighting the potential economic consequences of its closure. Iranian state media reported parliamentary support for closing the strait, though the final decision rests with Iran's national security council. Experts warn that blocking the Strait of Hormuz could cause oil prices to surge, though some analysts believe the U.S. would respond decisively to any such attempt. (not investment advice)</p>

Reyes cites several incidents where masked agents detained individuals, raising concerns about accountability and potential violations of civil rights.

Reyes advocates for a congressional ban on masks for immigration agents, emphasizing that the need for citizen accountability outweighs any justification for agent anonymity.

While new craters and damage are visible, a large support building at the Fordow site remains undamaged. The IAEA has called for a cessation of hostilities to address the situation, while analysts express concern that the strikes may complicate the tracking of uranium and incentivize Iran to move its program underground. The bombing has disrupted the IAEA's ability to account for Iran's nuclear stockpile and degraded the tools used for monitoring.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from both parties offered mixed reactions to President Trump's announcement of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Republicans like Senators Graham and Cruz largely supported the action, while Democrats such as House Leader Jeffries and Senator Schumer criticized the decision to launch the strikes without congressional consultation. Some Democrats argued the strikes were unconstitutional and called for Congress to enforce the War Powers Act. The article highlights the deep divisions within Congress regarding the president's authority to engage in military action without congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher after the United States struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would help resolve the conflict. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's call for peaceful resolution has helped isolate it from the conflict, leading to a positive mid-term market outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has entered the Israel-Iran war by bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, marking a critical escalation. The attacks targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the US claiming the sites were "completely and totally obliterated." However, the extent of the damage is yet to be independently verified, and concerns remain about potential radiation leaks. The article outlines the US rationale for intervention, global reactions, and potential consequences, including possible retaliatory actions by Iran and the risk of a wider conflict.</p>

          <p>The recent airstrikes by the US in Iran have created a precarious diplomatic situation for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Despite his calls for de-escalation, the White House proceeded with military action, challenging Starmer's efforts to maintain a solid relationship with President Trump while avoiding direct UK involvement. The UK government's response suggests support for the outcome of delaying Iran's nuclear weapons program, even if the means were not preferred. The article highlights the difficult decisions facing Starmer as the US could request military support from the UK in the coming weeks.</p>

The mission involved multiple in-flight refuelings, fighter jet escorts, and deception tactics. Officials claimed the strikes inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targets and warned Iran against retaliation.</p>

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships identifies five toxic phrases that trigger defiance in children. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," activate a child's fight-or-flight response. The study suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as explaining decisions and framing requests positively. The goal is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

Despite respecting other countries' decisions to increase defense investment, Spain will maintain its current spending level while fulfilling its obligations.
