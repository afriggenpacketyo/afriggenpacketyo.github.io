          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting the Israeli-occupied West Bank to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The discussions are expected to focus on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, increasing violence by Israeli settlers, and a recent non-binding resolution by Israel's parliament supporting the annexation of the West Bank. Wadephul's visit follows meetings with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem, where he cautioned that Israel risks growing international isolation over the situation in Gaza. The diplomatic engagement underscores Germany's concerns about the escalating conflict and its regional implications.</p>

Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, remained at 2.3%, indicating persistent underlying price pressures within the economy. These figures were released alongside data showing that the euro zone economy grew by a modest 0.1% in the second quarter, demonstrating some resilience despite challenges like U.S. trade tariffs.

          <p>Police in Leicestershire are questioning a 76-year-old man following an incident where eight children fell ill at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge. The man was arrested on suspicion of administering a noxious substance with intent to injure after the children were hospitalized, though they have since been discharged. Described by locals as a chaotic scene, the event prompted a large emergency response and has led to an investigation by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit. The local police force has also referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct over its handling of the initial reports.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has canceled the deployment of additional National Guard troops to Los Angeles and ordered most of the existing force to leave as anti-ICE protests have become smaller and more scattered. Approximately 250 members will remain to protect federal buildings, down from a peak of around 4,000 soldiers and 700 Marines deployed in June. The initial deployment by the Trump administration was met with strong opposition from California state and local officials, who argued it was unnecessary and escalated tensions.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially imposed a new, complex system of tariffs on goods from nearly 70 countries, escalating its aggressive trade policy. An executive order detailed rates ranging from 10% to over 40%, citing emergency powers to address trade deficits. This move follows months of negotiations after an initial threat in April, with some nations like the EU, Japan, and South Korea securing deals for lower rates, while others like Canada and India face higher duties. The policy aims to reshape global trade dynamics but has sparked widespread international criticism and uncertainty about its economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

The probe, detailed in an affidavit, alleges that some correctional officers are involved in smuggling drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine to detainees, contributing to violence and overdose deaths. This scrutiny comes as CoreCivic, which also houses ICE detainees at the facility, is expanding its immigrant detention business, raising questions about the suitability of its operations for government contracts. The investigation highlights significant safety and corruption concerns within the private prison system.</p>

          <p>France, the United Kingdom, and Canada have signaled their intent to formally recognize a state of Palestine, a significant diplomatic shift reflecting global frustration over the war in Gaza. While largely symbolic, this move by major Western powers, including two permanent UN Security Council members, would deepen their diplomatic split with Israel and the U.S. The recognition is tied to different conditions by each country, such as a ceasefire or reforms within the Palestinian Authority. This development aims to increase pressure on Israel and revive the two-state solution, though its practical impact on the ground remains a subject of debate among experts.</p>

          <p>Alaska is facing a severe budget crisis, heavily reliant on declining oil revenues, which has left the state unable to fund nearly $800 million in necessary school construction and maintenance. Despite bipartisan acknowledgment of the deteriorating conditions in many rural schools, lawmakers only passed a fraction of the required funding, most of which was subsequently vetoed by Governor Mike Dunleavy. This failure to secure funds leaves students in remote, often Indigenous, communities in unsafe buildings and postpones critical projects, including a new school for a village that lost its previous one to a fire. The situation highlights decades of legislative inaction on creating a stable, long-term fiscal plan for the state.</p>

Critics argue this guts the original Ali Act, which was designed to prevent the exploitation of fighters and monopolistic practices.

          <h2>UK Supreme Court Ruling Could Trigger Millions of Car Finance Compensation Claims</h2>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court is poised to deliver a landmark ruling on hidden commission payments in car finance deals, a decision that could allow millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-selling. The case focuses on whether undisclosed commissions paid by lenders to car dealers, which often incentivized higher interest rates, were unlawful. A judgment against the lenders could result in billions of pounds in payouts, with major financial institutions already setting aside large sums in anticipation. The ruling will provide critical clarity on these common arrangements and could significantly reshape the consumer lending landscape for vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive barrage of Russian drones and missiles struck Kyiv, killing at least 28 people, including three children, and injuring over 150. The attack, which caused an apartment block to collapse, continued despite a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump, who had given Russia a deadline of August 8 to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a demonstrative act of murder in response to peace efforts. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the eastern front, with Russia claiming to have captured the strategic town of Chasiv Yar, a claim Ukraine denies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened its first permanent office in Wellington, New Zealand, ending the country's status as the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance without a stand-alone FBI station. FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move shows the agency is prioritizing a permanent presence across all Five Eyes nations to counter threats in the Indo-Pacific, specifically mentioning China. Beijing strongly opposed the characterization, calling the claims groundless vilification rooted in a Cold War mentality. The move signals an intensification of intelligence and strategic focus in the region amid growing U.S.-China tensions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its microchips contain "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control, emphasizing its commitment to cybersecurity. The statement came after China's cyberspace regulator summoned the U.S. tech giant for an interview regarding potential security risks in its H20 chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls for the Chinese market. This regulatory scrutiny from Beijing highlights the immense challenge Nvidia faces as it navigates the escalating U.S.-China tech rivalry, trying to maintain access to the lucrative Chinese market while adhering to Washington's restrictions.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide this year, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comments. Trump stated that he became upset with Epstein for having "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club. The family's statement called the remark shocking, highlighting that Giuffre was preyed upon, not an object to be stolen, and demanded answers about what Trump knew. The development adds another layer to the ongoing questions about the relationship between Trump and Epstein, and comes as Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell has been interviewed by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A new UK law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed with a ninja sword in 2022, has come into effect, outlawing the manufacture, sale, and possession of these weapons. The law is the result of a relentless campaign by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, who believes her son would still be alive if such a ban had been implemented sooner. The two teenagers convicted of his murder had easily purchased the weapon online. The legislation, part of a broader government crackdown on knife crime, also requires retailers to report suspicious orders and perform strict age-verification checks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in South Africa have launched an innovative anti-poaching initiative called the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. This collaborative effort between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, thus deterring trafficking. Following successful trials confirming the process is safe for the animals, five rhinos were injected at the project's official launch. With South Africa's rhino population under severe threat from poaching, this method offers a new technological tool to disrupt the illegal horn trade.</p>
