        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position while her lawsuit proceeds. The judge ruled that the president's stated cause for removal, which relates to allegations about mortgage applications made before her tenure, is not legally permissible under the Federal Reserve Act. The court found that Cook's due process rights were violated and that her removal would cause irreparable harm, a decision her lawyer praised as a defense of the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference. The ruling represents a significant check on presidential power over the central bank's governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time globally, obesity has overtaken undernourishment as the primary form of malnutrition among school-aged children and adolescents, according to a new UNICEF report. The study found that since 2000, obesity rates for those aged five to nineteen have nearly tripled to 9.4%, while the number of underweight children has decreased. Researchers attribute this alarming shift to the widespread availability of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods that are shaping children's diets more than personal choice. UNICEF is urging governments to improve food environments through better labeling, marketing restrictions, and ensuring access to nutritious meals to combat this growing health crisis.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai reveals that a record 47% of U.S. businesses have redirected investments originally planned for China to other regions, with Southeast Asia being the top alternative. The report cites ongoing trade tensions and the short-term nature of tariff truces as major drivers for this strategic shift in supply chain planning. U.S. companies also report facing increased competition within China and have expressed record-low confidence in the five-year business outlook there. While noting some improvements in regulatory transparency, the findings highlight a significant trend of diversification away from the Chinese market amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from a devastating chlamydia epidemic that causes blindness, infertility, and death. Developed over a decade by university scientists, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce mortality from the disease by at least 65%. While the approval is a major milestone for conservation efforts, researchers stress that major funding is now needed to roll out the vaccine to wildlife hospitals and at-risk populations. Experts also caution that the vaccine alone cannot save the species, emphasizing the critical need to address other threats like habitat loss.</p>

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Accuses Trump of 'Unhinged Obsession' with the State</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his State of the State address, California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump's administration of having a "relentless, unhinged California obsession" and leading an assault on the state's progressive values. Newsom highlighted numerous points of conflict, including federal actions on immigration, high-speed rail funding, and vehicle emission standards, noting that California has filed 41 lawsuits against the administration. While touting the state's achievements in technology and green energy, Newsom framed California as a bastion of resistance against federal overreach. State Republicans criticized the governor for focusing on his national profile rather than addressing California's internal issues like budget deficits and homelessness.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that the European Union impose tariffs of up to 100% on imports from China and India to penalize them for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The move is intended to increase economic pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, with Washington reportedly prepared to mirror any tariffs the EU enacts. This strategy marks a significant escalation of secondary sanctions, targeting major economies that have helped sustain Russia's finances throughout the conflict. The proposal follows a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that yielded little progress toward securing a ceasefire. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A birthday book created for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, recently released by Congress, provides a sickening look into the culture of his elite social circle. The document contains lurid tributes, crude jokes, and sexually explicit references from powerful figures, seemingly alluding to and even celebrating Epstein's predatory lifestyle and attraction to young women. Among the entries is a now-infamous letter and sketch attributed to Donald Trump, which the White House denies, and other contributions from prominent business leaders and associates. This article suggests the book serves as a validation for long-held suspicions that Epstein's behavior was an open secret enabled by his powerful connections.</p>

          <p>China's economy is facing ongoing deflationary challenges, as its consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.4% in August compared to the previous year, a larger drop than economists had predicted.

These figures reflect persistent weak domestic demand and industrial oversupply, prompting increased calls for Beijing to implement stronger stimulus measures to support the economy.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a rare rebuke of Israel following its airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Doha, stating the action "does not advance Israel or America's goals." In a social media post, Trump emphasized that the decision was made solely by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and that he felt "very badly" about the attack occurring in Qatar, a key U.S. ally. The White House confirmed that Trump was notified by the U.S. military just before the strike but that it was too late to stop it. The president assured Qatar's leaders that such an attack would not happen again on their soil.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged in after-hours trading following the release of its quarterly earnings report, despite missing current revenue expectations. Investors and analysts focused instead on the company's staggering forward-looking projections, driven by massive growth in its cloud infrastructure business and major new AI-related contracts, including a significant deal with OpenAI. The company forecasts its cloud revenue to grow exponentially over the next several years, causing analysts on the earnings call to express their shock and praise for the "momentous" outlook. The guidance signals a major competitive shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test that can detect key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed with over 1,000 patients in the UK's National Health Service, a development that could revolutionize diagnosis. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from around 70% to over 90%, offering a simpler and cheaper alternative to current methods like PET scans or lumbar punctures. Led by University College London, the study aims to see how the test performs in a real-world clinical setting. If successful, it could enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses, which is crucial for the effectiveness of emerging treatments.</p>

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the expansion of an existing program that has already been credited with lifting thousands of families out of poverty. The initiative, which begins in November, is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually and is part of a broader effort to support family stability and workforce participation.

          <p>The Los Angeles-based band La Santa Cecilia is using its music to create a space for joy and solidarity amid rising fears in the immigrant community following a recent Supreme Court ruling. The decision allows immigration agents to detain individuals based on suspicion of their legal status, a development the band members, long-time advocates for immigrant rights, find deeply concerning. The group's famous 2013 song, "Ice el Hielo," which details the plight of undocumented families separated by deportation, has gained renewed relevance. The band vows to continue using its platform to speak out for their community and affirm their humanity in a hostile political climate.</p>

          <p>Community activists in Chicago are working to support and protect immigrant communities as the Trump administration ramps up Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in an operation dubbed "Midway Blitz." Organizers are using hotlines and social media to verify ICE sightings and provide on-the-ground support to families, aiming to combat fear and misinformation. The increased enforcement has left many residents fearful, with some community events being postponed. While the Department of Homeland Security states it is targeting criminals, activists argue that the raids are broadly targeting anyone who appears to be of a certain ethnicity, regardless of their legal status.</p>

This major downward revision indicates that the job market was cooling more substantially last year than was understood at the time. The adjustment, part of a standard annual process to incorporate more comprehensive data on business openings and closings, provides new evidence of a slowing economy.

Led by a CEO who regularly rides the buses to gather feedback, the Metro system achieved this success without a budget increase.
