          <p>On the sixth anniversary of his 2019 World Cup final heroics, Ben Stokes once again demonstrated his indispensable value to English cricket. He delivered a marathon bowling performance, taking crucial wickets despite physical strain, to secure a narrow 22-run victory against India in the third Test at Lord's. This pivotal win gives England a 2-1 lead in the five-Test series. The match was also notable for the triumphant return of fast bowler Jofra Archer, who was guided and inspired by his captain's leadership throughout the tense final day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a US Department of Justice memo confirming Jeffrey Epstein's death by suicide and stating no 'client list' was found, Prince Andrew is reportedly free to travel without fear of legal repercussions. However, royal experts assert that he remains a significant embarrassment to the royal family and is unlikely to regain any public role or favor. His reputation is considered permanently tarnished by his association with Epstein and his controversial 2019 "Newsnight" interview. Any future for him is seen as severely limited, confined to private life and away from official duties.</p>

          <p>China's voluntary health insurance scheme for urban and rural residents saw another significant drop in enrollment, with 15.8 million fewer people participating in 2024 compared to the previous year. Experts attribute the ongoing decline to rising premiums and stagnating incomes, which place a heavy financial burden on many families, particularly in rural areas. This trend is increasing pressure on China's basic medical insurance system, which is grappling with economic challenges and what appears to be declining public trust in the program's affordability and value.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant policy shift, threatening to impose 100% tariffs on any country doing business with Russia if a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. The move, described as implementing secondary sanctions, reflects his growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate an end to the conflict. Concurrently, Trump revealed a deal to sell U.S.-manufactured weapons to NATO allies, who will then transfer their own stockpiles to Ukraine, ensuring Kyiv is supplied without direct U.S. payment.</p>

The report indicates that two fuel cut-off switches were moved to the 'cut-off' position shortly after takeoff, causing the engines to lose power and leading to the crash that killed 260 people. However, aviation experts criticize the report for being selective, lacking a full cockpit voice recorder transcript, and not providing context for the pilots' actions.

          <p>Mainland China is on track to set a new record for the number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in a single year. In the first half of 2025, fund managers introduced 166 new ETFs, putting the country on pace to surpass the 2021 record of 277. This surge is driven by a combination of favorable government regulations, including streamlined approvals and lower fees, and growing investor demand for such products. The trend in China mirrors a broader global boom in the ETF market, which offers diversified investment options on stock exchanges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' forecasts and keeping the country on track to meet its annual 5% growth target. However, underlying data revealed weaknesses, as retail sales growth slowed significantly and the real estate slump deepened. These signs of fragility, combined with persistent deflationary pressures, are fueling calls for policymakers to introduce more fiscal stimulus and deeper reforms to boost domestic consumption and ensure a more sustainable recovery.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work, were set to expire this week. The administration had argued that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their return, a claim disputed by immigrant advocates. The court's intervention provides a brief reprieve for this group as the legal battle over their status continues, highlighting the precarious nature of the TPS program.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles, with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This remarkable shift has been driven by years of consistent and strong government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs and progressively higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars. The country has also invested heavily in public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs the logical and affordable choice for consumers, visibly transforming the country's roads.</p>

Using the examples of Kathleen Reinhardt, the new curator of the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale, and Lynn Rother, a leading provenance researcher at MoMA, the author argues their unique perspective is vital. Having lived between two different systems, they bring a critical eye to established narratives, power structures, and historical complexities. Their success marks a shift from the post-reunification era when East Germans were often overlooked or stereotyped.</p>

Lawyers for the victim's family argue the driver assistance system failed to warn the driver or brake, while Tesla contends the driver was distracted by his phone and is solely to blame.
