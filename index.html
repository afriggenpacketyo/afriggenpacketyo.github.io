          <p>Shohei Ohtani continued his impressive season with his 10th home run, tying the game in the sixth inning, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately lost to the Miami Marlins 5-4 in 10 innings. Ohtani also contributed a double, going 2-for-5 with two RBIs in the game. The Dodgers faced an uphill battle after placing Teoscar Hernandez on the injured list, impacting their offensive lineup, and Ohtani acknowledged the team's need to score more early runs to secure victories. Despite the loss, Ohtani's consistent power hitting marks his fifth straight season with double-digit home runs.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating geopolitical tensions with Pakistan, Indian markets have remained largely stable, driven by strong domestic demand and optimism regarding India's growth prospects. Investors appear to be drawing confidence from India's progress in trade talks with major partners, including a recently sealed free trade agreement with the U.K., and the expectation of a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. soon. While experts acknowledge the potential for short-term market volatility if the conflict escalates, the overall sentiment suggests that the Indian economy's strong fundamentals will continue to outweigh geopolitical concerns. The article notes that Indian assets are expected to remain fairly contained despite the increase in tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate federal research into pollution caused by satellites and rockets, including those operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and Starlink. This decision raises conflict-of-interest concerns, as the research could lead to regulations or logistical challenges for Musk's companies. The research projects, part of NOAA's office of atmospheric research, aimed to study the accumulation of metals in the stratosphere from spacecraft re-entry and the impact of spaceflight on Earth's climate, and critics argue that cutting funding protects a major donor and political ally. With the cancellation of these projects, Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos will effectively oversee the health of the stratosphere, as their companies operate a large number of satellites.</p>

          <p>A commission is proposing the creation of a new local authority to oversee rebuilding efforts in fire-ravaged neighborhoods, aiming to coordinate planning, secure funding, and prioritize residents displaced by the fires. The proposed authority would use tax-increment financing and other resources to purchase lots and guide the rebuilding process, addressing concerns about developers building more expensive homes. The commission also recommends implementing stricter building standards and improving water infrastructure to enhance fire safety and resilience.</p>

          <p>California Democrats initially blocked a bill that would have made soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex an automatic felony, leading to accusations of being soft on sex crimes. However, after facing criticism, Democratic leaders reached a compromise and revived the bill, now including a provision that makes it a felony if the buyer is more than three years older than the teen. The article discusses the political and philosophical complexities surrounding sex work and the challenges Democrats face in addressing the issue while balancing concerns about criminal justice reform.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' proposed budget is facing criticism for its planned cuts to essential city services, including transportation, street maintenance, and parks. The proposed budget would reduce staff in the Department of Transportation and the Bureau of Street Services, potentially leading to longer response times for broken streetlights and deteriorating infrastructure. Critics argue that these cuts are short-sighted and will negatively impact the city's livability, especially as Los Angeles prepares to host major international events. The article calls for alternative solutions, such as renegotiating union contracts and avoiding cuts to revenue-generating programs.</p>

The shift to renewable energy is projected to negatively impact lower-income individuals and threaten jobs in the carbon economy. The article suggests that California needs to reconsider its approach to energy policy and leverage its own fossil fuel resources to ensure affordable and reliable energy.</p>
