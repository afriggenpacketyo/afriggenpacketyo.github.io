          <p>The United States and Iran convened in Oman for detailed talks regarding Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, focusing on uranium enrichment. These negotiations, described as "serious and work-focused," involved the exchange of written points and aimed to address disagreements on major issues. A U.S. official noted the talks were "positive and productive," with plans for further meetings in Europe, while Oman expressed hope for an agreement based on mutual respect. Simultaneously, an explosion at an Iranian port killed four and injured hundreds, adding to the already tense geopolitical landscape, as the talks seek to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, with Trump previously threatening airstrikes if a deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Louisiana has raised concerns about the apparent deportation of a two-year-old American citizen, identified as VML, to Honduras alongside her mother and sister. The judge stated that this occurred "with no meaningful process," even as the court sought to clarify the girl's status. VML and her family were taken into ICE custody during a routine check-in, prompting deportation proceedings for the mother and sister. The Department of Homeland Security defended its decision, stating that the parents chose to take the child with them, however the girl's father was seemingly denied the opportunity to prevent his daughter's removal.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in Americans' faith in President Trump across key issues, including the economy and immigration policy, with a majority describing his second term as "scary". The surveys reveal low approval ratings for Trump's handling of the presidency, trade policies, and the economy, even among Republicans. Concerns about Trump's priorities and the potential for a recession are also prevalent. The findings suggest growing fatigue among Americans after a period marked by market volatility and controversial deportations.</p>
