        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has accused Apple and its Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, of lying under oath during the Epic Games trial, specifically regarding Apple's commission fees on App Store purchases. The judge stated that Apple willfully violated a previous court order and presented misleading evidence, including fabricated internal deliberations. She referred the matter to U.S. attorneys for potential criminal contempt proceedings. Apple is now ordered to cease imposing commissions on in-app web link purchases and to cover Epic Games' attorney fees related to this issue. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the decision as a victory for developers, forcing Apple to compete fairly.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced the creation of a new reconstruction and investment fund, formalizing an economic agreement aimed at providing the U.S. access to proceeds from Ukraine's mineral reserves to fund post-war rebuilding.

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student and green card holder, has been released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order in Vermont. Mahdawi's attorneys argued that the Trump administration was seeking to deport him in retaliation for his leadership in pro-Palestinian protests, violating his First Amendment rights. Judge Geoffrey Crawford cited concerns about chilling efforts to suppress debate, drawing parallels to historical periods of curtailed speech. The Justice Department has announced its intention to appeal the court order, while Mahdawi has expressed compassion for both Palestinian and Jewish people, denying allegations of antisemitism within the Columbia protests.</p>

Major retailers have warned the White House that continued tariffs could lead to empty store shelves, highlighting the broader economic consequences of these policies.

          <p>The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, had filed a protective order against him in 2021 citing allegations of domestic violence. Jennifer Vasquez sought the order alleging Abrego Garcia physically assaulted her, however, the case was dismissed after she failed to appear for a final hearing. Vasquez has confirmed seeking the order but states that the situation did not escalate and the couple worked through it privately. The Department of Homeland Security shared Vasquez's protective order on X, claiming Abrego Garcia is "not a sympathetic figure," while Abrego Garcia's legal team maintains he has not been criminally convicted.</p>
