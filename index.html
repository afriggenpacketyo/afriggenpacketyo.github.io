          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its global economic growth forecast for 2025 and 2026, partly attributing the improvement to a softening of US tariffs. This upgrade, reflecting a surge in US imports as firms anticipated higher taxes, projects global growth at 3% and 3.1% respectively. The IMF, however, cautions that future higher tariffs and increased uncertainty could still impede economic activity. The article notes the UK is expected to be among the fastest-growing advanced economies.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building on Monday evening was reportedly aimed at NFL offices, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The gunman, Shane Tamura, had a note indicating he blamed the NFL for his suspected CTE, a brain injury linked to head trauma. Tamura, who drove from Las Vegas, mistakenly took an elevator to Rudin Management, where he killed four people, including an NYPD officer, before dying by suicide. The NFL has advised New York employees to work from home and increased security.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase, already the largest credit card issuer in the U.S., is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to assume the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. Sources familiar with the negotiations indicate that other contenders like American Express and Synchrony have been bypassed. This potential shift would mark a significant change for the Apple Card, which has been exclusively issued by Goldman Sachs since its launch. The article notes that both banks declined to comment, and Apple did not immediately respond.</p>

          <p>Spotify shares dropped over 9% after the company reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations and provided weak guidance for the current quarter. CEO Daniel Ek expressed dissatisfaction with the advertising business, calling it an "execution challenge" rather than a strategic flaw, despite advertising-supported revenues declining. The streaming service reported a net loss of 86 million euros, attributing it to higher personnel, marketing, and professional services costs.

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results but issued fiscal year 2026 guidance that includes a projected $1 billion pre-tax hit from higher tariff costs. CFO Andre Schulten stated mid-single-digit price increases would affect about a quarter of P&G's items in Q1 2026 due to tariffs and innovation. The company anticipates absorbing most tariff costs through productivity but will pass some on to "value-seeking" consumers. The article notes the company's new CEO appointment and a restructuring plan involving 7,000 non-manufacturing job cuts over two years. (not investment advice)</p>
