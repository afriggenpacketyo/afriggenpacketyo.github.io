          <p>Economic data from the first nine months of 2025 shows that China's leading cities, Shanghai and Beijing, have outpaced the national average GDP growth. This expansion is largely driven by strong domestic demand, particularly in hi-tech manufacturing sectors like artificial intelligence and biotechnology. While this indicates a strengthening internal economic momentum, officials caution that external uncertainties persist and further policy support is needed to solidify the recovery.</p>

The team's year was marked by controversy, including forfeited games and a lawsuit filed by teammates, reflecting a broader political and legal conflict over transgender participation in school sports. The situation has highlighted the clash between a 2013 California state law and a federal executive order from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders are expected to endorse a plan to use €140 billion in frozen Russian state assets to provide a "reparations loan" to Ukraine. This proposal aims to give Kyiv immediate access to much-needed funds for its war effort and future reconstruction. However, the plan faces significant legal hurdles and concerns from member states like Belgium, where most of the assets are held, over potential Russian legal challenges and the precedent it could set for global financial stability.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cautioned that a move by Israel's parliament toward annexing the occupied West Bank would be "counterproductive" and threaten the current U.S.-led peace plan for Gaza. The warning was issued after far-right Israeli politicians advanced a bill to grant Israel authority over the territory, which Palestinians claim for a future state. This legislative push creates a diplomatic challenge, risking alienation of the U.S. and Arab nations.</p>

          <p>The International Chess Federation (FIDE) is considering disciplinary action against former Russian world champion Vladimir Kramnik following the death of American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky at age 29.

The situation has prompted outrage in the chess community and highlighted growing concerns about harassment and toxicity in the online version of the sport.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved its 19th package of sanctions against Russia, aiming to further curtail Moscow's ability to fund its war in Ukraine. The new measures include a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and target Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers used to circumvent previous restrictions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, present in Brussels for the announcement, praised the move as a clear signal that prolonging the war comes at a cost.</p>

To ensure a same-day postmark, the USPS advises customers to request one in person at a post office counter.</p>

          <p>The second and final debate in New York City's mayoral race was a contentious affair, dominated by sharp exchanges between the leading candidates but unlikely to have altered the race's trajectory. Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani defended his polling lead against attacks from independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa, who both questioned his experience. The forum highlighted the deep rivalry between the candidates as they clashed over policy, temperament, and their ability to lead the nation's largest city.</p>

With quarterback Lamar Jackson's potential return, their upcoming game against the Chicago Bears is viewed as a make-or-break moment for their season. A victory could spark a turnaround, but a loss would likely extinguish any remaining playoff aspirations for the beleaguered team.</p>

          <p>A significant shortage of smaller, more affordable "starter homes" is a major barrier for many first-time homebuyers across the United States. Factors contributing to this scarcity include rising construction material costs, restrictive local zoning laws, and a stagnant market where existing homeowners are hesitant to sell and lose their low mortgage rates. This housing crunch forces many aspiring buyers to consider homes far from urban centers or postpone their homeownership goals indefinitely.</p>
