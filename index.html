          <p>President Trump expressed his frustration with both Israel and Iran, accusing them of violating a ceasefire agreement he had announced the previous night. Trump stated that both countries "don't know what the f--- they're doing" and criticized Israel for immediately dropping bombs after the deal was made. He spoke with reporters before departing for a NATO summit in the Netherlands and mentioned a firm conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Neither Iran nor Israel have commented on Trump's remarks regarding the ceasefire violations, and the agreement involved two 12-hour ceasefire periods. The White House source stated Trump was exceptionally firm and direct with Prime Minister Netanyahu about what needed to happen to sustain the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, a suspect charged in connection with the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, died in federal custody. The 32-year-old was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles and pronounced dead at a local hospital, with the cause of death remaining unclear. Park had been indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property and was apprehended in Poland after the bombing.

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that systemic failures at Boeing, including a lack of safety processes and an inexperienced workforce, led to the door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet. Investigators are unsure who reinstalled the door plug without replacing four key bolts, which were likely discarded. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy stated that the accident should not have happened and highlighted Boeing's reliance on a single point of failure and workers with little formal training. The incident prompted the FAA to increase its oversight and Boeing to implement changes, including more robust training, and the company is still working to rebuild trust after two deadly 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p>

          <p>Carnival shares experienced a rise of approximately 7% after the cruise line announced better-than-expected second-quarter results and increased its full-year guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share, surpassing analysts' estimates, and a record revenue of $6.3 billion. Net income significantly increased to $565 million, and CEO Josh Weinstein noted strong momentum across all of Carnival's brands. As a result of this outperformance, Carnival has raised its adjusted net income forecast for the year by 40%, with the opening of Celebration Key in the Bahamas expected soon.</p>

          <p>The French football club Lyon has been relegated to Ligue 2 due to the poor state of their finances. The decision was made by the DNGC, the body overseeing the accounts of French professional football clubs, after Lyon officials failed to demonstrate sufficient financial improvements. Lyon's debts were announced to be Â£422m last October, and despite raising funds through player sales and releasing high earners, the club could not convince the DNGC to lift the punishment. Lyon has the right to appeal the decision, and if it stands, Reims will replace them in the top flight.</p>

          <p>The prosecution and defense have rested their cases in the sex trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, with the defense not calling any witnesses. Closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Thursday, and the defense team moved for acquittal, claiming the government failed to prove the charges. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts and faces up to life in prison if convicted, and the trial has featured testimony about alleged sexual encounters with sex workers. The core issue is whether Combs coerced women into sexual encounters, with prosecutors arguing that these encounters constitute sex trafficking and racketeering, while the defense claims they were consensual.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat is becoming a significant threat to rural America, with over half of rural zip codes in the United States having "high" heat vulnerability. This vulnerability is exacerbated by factors such as an older population, higher rates of chronic health conditions, and inadequate infrastructure. Rural areas often have older buildings with poor insulation, limited access to cooling systems, and a greater dependence on outdoor labor, and the health infrastructure is also lacking, with fewer nearby clinics and longer emergency response times. Addressing these challenges requires upgrades to infrastructure, structural investments in healthcare, and policy changes to protect workers from extreme heat.</p>

          <p>A 1-year certificate of deposit (CD) currently offers a higher guaranteed interest rate than a high-yield savings account, making it a potentially more lucrative option for a $10,000 deposit. With a CD, the interest rate is fixed, ensuring a specific return over the term, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. Considering potential interest rate cuts, locking in a higher rate with a CD may be beneficial.

          <p>Rajan Menon argues against regime change in Iran, suggesting that President Trump should avoid this path despite having bombed Iran's nuclear enrichment installations. A war for regime change would create a rift in Trump's base and pose military and strategic hazards due to Iran's size and the strength of its army. The multi-ethnic nature of Iran could also lead to prolonged disorder and bloodletting, and an American intervention could destabilize the region. Menon suggests that Trump should take the opportunity to forget about regime change, as it will create more problems than it solves.</p>

Home equity loans offer fixed rates and utilize the home as collateral, while personal loans often have higher and potentially variable rates.

          <p>The UN has condemned the US and Israel-backed food distribution system in Gaza, calling it a "death trap," after dozens of people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire while waiting for aid. At least 46 people were killed in two separate incidents, and the UN reports that over 410 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire or shelling since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began work. The GHF, backed by the US and Israel, is accused of co-operating with Israel's goals in the war against Hamas, while Israel sees the GHF as key to undermining Hamas control in Gaza. A UN spokesman condemned Israel's militarized humanitarian assistance mechanism, stating that the weaponization of food constitutes a war crime.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voiced his frustration over the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous" and "evasive." The briefing, which was set to include briefers from the Department of State, the Joint Chiefs, the CIA, and the DNI, was postponed to later in the week to allow for other briefers to join. Schumer emphasized the importance of transparency and real information, particularly regarding the risks facing American service members, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the postponement a slap in the face to Congress.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are set to marry in Venice, Italy, this week in a three-day celebration estimated to cost between $64 million and $76 million. The event is expected to draw high-profile guests, and the ceremony will likely be held on San Giorgio Maggiore. However, the wedding faces protests from locals who are frustrated with the city's focus on wealthy tourists and the lack of attention to residents' needs. Greenpeace activists also protested the wedding, and the event is expected to source most of its provisions from Venetian vendors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the anonymity of heat waves compared to other natural disasters and suggests that naming heat waves could raise public awareness. Unlike storms, earthquakes, or volcanoes, heat waves often lack a specific identity, making them difficult to remember and prioritize in public discourse. Some organizations have proposed labeling heat waves to give them greater purchase on cultural memory, and a pilot program in Seville, Spain, showed that naming a heat wave led to increased heat-safety behaviors. While the idea may be tricky to implement due to the frequency and varying intensity of heat waves, the author argues that finding a way to make them more conspicuous is essential.</p>
