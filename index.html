          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin whose nomination faced Senate opposition due to his involvement in "Stop the Steal" activities. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a staunch defender of Trump and repeated false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, which were part of a lawsuit against Fox News. Her appointment brings a controversial figure into a key Justice Department role, raising concerns about the impartiality of the office. Trump indicated Martin would take on a new role at the Justice Department, focusing on the alleged "weaponization" of the government during the Biden administration and pardons.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association of Ireland is facing mounting pressure to allow players the choice between wearing skorts or shorts, with former All-Star Jane Adams labeling the enforced skort rule as "sexism." A recent survey indicated that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. A Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, highlighting the growing discomfort and debate surrounding the dress code in women's Gaelic games. Some players have threatened to forfeit games rather than wear skorts, while others believe there are more pressing issues facing women's sports than what uniform is required.</p>

          <p>A directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove ideologies deemed ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù from military service academies has led to significant controversy at West Point. The order resulted in the cancellation of classes, book bans, and resignations from professors protesting the changes. The academy is struggling to balance academic freedom with obligations to the Defense Department, leading to debates over the removal of works by Black authors and discussions of atrocities against Native Americans. This situation has forced West Point to confront the challenges of navigating culture wars within a military institution.</p>
