            <p>A judge has ruled that resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez will continue, despite the current Los Angeles District Attorney's attempt to withdraw a previous request for resentencing. The Menendez brothers were convicted of murdering their parents in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Former DA George Gasc√≥n had sought to have them resentenced, potentially making them eligible for release, but current DA Nathan Hochman opposes this, arguing they haven't fully accepted responsibility. The resentencing hearings are scheduled for April 17 and 18.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is moving to withhold federal funds from Maine after the state refused to sign a Title IX resolution agreement banning transgender athletes from girls' sports. The U.S. Department of Education will initiate proceedings to terminate Maine's K-12 education funding and refer the case to the Department of Justice. Maine officials argue that Title IX does not prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' sports, citing federal court rulings. Governor Janet Mills previously stated she would see the Trump administration in court over the matter.</p>

            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported on grounds that he threatens foreign policy, as alleged by the Trump administration. Khalil, a green card holder married to an American citizen, was a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests. The ruling aligns with Secretary of State Marco Rubio's assertion that Khalil's presence poses an adverse foreign policy consequence. Khalil's lawyers plan to file applications for relief by April 23, while a federal court case in New Jersey remains active, potentially blocking his deportation.</p>

            <p>Monica Sementilli, wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, has been found guilty of murder for his 2017 death. The case involved allegations of an affair with Robert Baker, who pleaded no contest to the murder. Prosecutors argued that Monica conspired with Baker to kill Fabio for financial gain, pointing to evidence like shared security system credentials and her actions on the day of the murder. The defense maintained that Monica had no involvement and that Baker acted alone. The verdict comes after a lengthy trial and years of legal proceedings.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must lift its freeze on federal funding to Maine, which was imposed after the state refused to ban transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports.

The Department of Education has also referred the state to the Department of Justice over the issue.

            <p>Minecraft, the most popular game in history, has recently seen a surge in popularity with the release of "A Minecraft Movie," which has smashed box office expectations. The game, created by Markus Persson, allows players to virtually mine blocks and build creations, either solo or with friends, and is often compared to a digital version of Legos. Minecraft's continued growth is attributed to its ease of modification, vast community, and nostalgic appeal. The movie's success is driven by Gen Z players who grew up on the game and its vibrant online community.</p>

Monica is accused of conspiring with Baker, but he maintains she is innocent. Baker's plea has resulted in Monica being tried separately for the murder of her husband.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors allege that Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker's continued love affair while incarcerated provides additional evidence of their conspiracy to murder Fabio Sementilli. Police sting operations, intercepted letters, and recorded jail phone calls are cited as proof of their ongoing commitment to each other and a secrecy pact. The prosecution claims the pair used coded language to express their love and commitment, while the defense argues that the affair is irrelevant to proving a murder conspiracy.

            <p>Stocks closed higher on Friday, rebounding from a turbulent week marked by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all posted gains, with the S&P 500 recording its best weekly performance since November 2023. Despite the positive close, economists remain cautious about the potential impact of the trade war on corporate profits and the broader economy. China has announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, matching the increased duties imposed by President Trump.</p>

            <p>President Trump is threatening Mexico with new tariffs over the country's failure to deliver water to Texas farmers under a 1944 treaty. Mexico attributes the shortfall to a severe drought, but Trump accuses the country of "stealing" water. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has vowed to deliver a significant amount of the owed water soon. This dispute adds to already strained relations between the U.S. and Mexico, with Trump having imposed tariffs previously over immigration and fentanyl issues.</p>

Hochman argued that the brothers have not shown proper "insight" into their crimes, but the judge dismissed this as irrelevant.

Eaton Fire Residents United, a group of concerned citizens, shares indoor environmental testing data on an online map. The group hopes the data will help residents convince insurers to cover testing and remediation. The move comes as FEMA declines to conduct widespread environmental testing.</p>

            <p>"The Amateur," directed by James Hawes, presents a promising spy thriller about a CIA decoder seeking revenge for his wife's murder. Rami Malek delivers a compelling performance, and the supporting cast is strong, but the film ultimately falls flat due to a lack of suspense and a predictable plot. The movie lacks the thrill and mystery expected of the genre. While the execution seems expert, the internal narrative design is dull.</p>
