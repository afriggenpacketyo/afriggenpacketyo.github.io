          <p>President Trump refuted claims that bond market fluctuations impacted his decision to temporarily halt aggressive reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trading partners. In a Time magazine interview, Trump stated the pause was to finalize desired numbers, not due to market concerns. He acknowledged the bond market experienced "yips" but asserted his confidence in the U.S. economy, adding that he would consider it a victory even with tariffs as high as 50% in place after a year. The initial tariff announcement had caused market instability with rising treasury yields and investors selling stocks and the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly used the Signal app on a personal computer in his Pentagon office connected to an unsecured commercial internet line, also known as a "dirty line". This line lacks the firewall protections of the Defense Department's systems, potentially exposing sensitive information. Hegseth denied sharing classified war plans over Signal but admitted to informal unclassified coordination. The Pentagon spokesperson initially stated Hegseth never used Signal on his government computer, but later called the report "fake news" after ABC News's report. This raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities and the handling of sensitive communications.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos faces sentencing on Long Island after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking 87 months in prison, citing his lack of remorse and fraudulent behavior that "made a mockery of our election system". Santos admitted to fabricating his biography to enrich himself and capture one of the highest offices. He has requested leniency, acknowledging responsibility for his actions but contesting the severity of the prosecution's request. As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed to have made "200 deals" on tariffs and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during an interview. He stated that negotiations would be "finished" in three to four weeks, but did not provide details on the countries or terms of the deals. Chinese officials have disputed the White House's characterization of active discussions, calling claims of ongoing consultations on the tariff issue "fake news". Trump also discussed deportations and the Russia-Ukraine war, blaming Ukraine for initiating the conflict and expressing optimism about reaching a peace deal that would cede some Ukrainian territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian general, General-lieutenant Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed by a car bomb just outside Moscow, prompting a murder investigation. The explosive device detonated in a parked car, and investigators believe it was an improvised explosive device packed with metal fragments. Moskalik was the deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff and had been involved in "Normandy format" talks on Ukraine in 2015. The bombing is similar to previous attacks on Russians linked to Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine, although Kyiv has not commented on this specific incident.</p>

          <p>A judge ruled that prosecutors can pursue the death penalty against Bryan Kohberger, charged with the murders of four University of Idaho students, despite his autism diagnosis. Kohberger's attorneys argued that his autism spectrum disorder reduces his culpability and that executing someone with autism would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The judge agreed that jurors will likely be able to hear much of the 911 call made from outside the house by two surviving roommates roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up. The judge stated that autism may be a mitigating factor but not a disqualifier for the death penalty.</p>

The article highlights the importance of public officials upholding democratic norms and the rule of law, even in the face of pressure from elected leaders. Bar's stand is not sufficient in itself to stop a self-coup, but he has demonstrated where the allegiance of public officials must lie.</p>

Others emphasize the opportunity for Europe to strengthen its economy and assert its place in the global world.
