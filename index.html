          <h2>Police Officials Express Concerns Over Proposed Early Prisoner Release</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 05:19:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior police and security leaders have voiced concerns regarding the government's plans to release some prisoners early in an effort to ease overcrowding, arguing that the proposals could negatively impact public safety. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, officials including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, cited concerns about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. While acknowledging the government's need to address prison overcrowding, Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley stated that the proposed solutions would create extra work for the police. The government maintains that the announced proposals have addressed many of the concerns raised, ensuring repeat offenders can still face short sentences and terrorists will not be eligible for early release. The government also plans to increase probation funding to tag and monitor more offenders in the community.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7m fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching regulations concerning sewage spills and shareholder payouts. Ofwat found that three-quarters of Thames Water's storm overflows were spilling routinely, not just during exceptional circumstances, which poses a risk to human health and damages the environment. The regulator also fined Thames Water for making shareholder payouts that did not reflect the company's performance. Thames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK's population, faces ongoing criticism for its performance and struggles with a Â£20bn debt pile, though the company has secured a Â£3bn rescue loan to avoid collapse.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Ukrainian drones targeted Russia overnight, with dozens aimed at Moscow, causing flight disruptions. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 296 drones over 12 regions, including Moscow, while Moscow Governor Andrei Vorobyov reported damage to three homes. Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine's Counter-Disinformation Center, said the attacks hit targets such as the Dubna Machine-Building Plant and the Technopark ELMA-Zelenograd facility, which are involved in aviation, missile, drone technology, and microelectronics. Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine, launching six missiles and 88 strike drones, with 71 drones neutralized; the intensity of strikes has increased since President Trump's return to office, who has been critical of Putin's actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US government has directed embassies worldwide to halt scheduling student visa appointments as it plans to expand social media vetting for applicants. According to an official memo, this policy change will have significant implications for embassies and consulates. The move is part of President Trump's broader crackdown on universities he views as too left-wing and insufficiently combating antisemitism. China has urged the US to protect international students' rights in response to the policy, while universities are likely concerned about the financial impact as they rely on foreign students for tuition revenue. The Trump administration has already frozen university funding and moved to deport students, actions that have faced legal challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Nature suggests that fat cells may have a 'metabolic memory' of obesity, influencing metabolic pathways even after weight loss, potentially leading to easier weight regain. Researchers analyzed chemical markers on fat cells in mice and humans, finding that those with a history of obesity continued to exhibit unhealthy metabolic changes even after losing weight. While biology plays a role, the study emphasizes that genetics, environment, psychology, and social factors also shape obesity. Experts recommend maintaining healthy habits such as physical activity, a balanced diet, and strength training to counteract the genetic predispositions promoting weight gain.</p>

          <p>In Gila County, Arizona, a region that heavily supported President Trump, residents hold complex views on Medicaid, as many depend on the program despite concerns about government waste. Medicaid enrollment has nearly doubled in the county over the past 15 years, with almost 40% of residents now covered by Medicaid or CHIP. Proposed Republican cuts to Medicaid, including work requirements and stricter eligibility verification, are sparking debate, as some residents worry about losing coverage while others support tighter rules. The situation highlights the tension between conservative political views and the reliance on government healthcare in rural communities.</p>

Home prices have increased nearly 50% since before the pandemic, and mortgage interest rates have risen significantly, making homeownership unaffordable for many. Construction of single-family homes has decreased, and the ongoing tariff debate, particularly regarding Canadian lumber, has created further uncertainty for builders.</p>

          <p>The word 'pride' has transformed from a vice to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment, dating back to before the 12th century when it meant 'inordinate self-esteem.' In the 14th century, it began to refer to 'a reasonable form of self-respect,' and in the 1960s, it became associated with the LGBTQ+ community, influenced by the civil rights movement. Following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969, organizers chose 'pride' as a rallying cry to reject negativity and embrace self-esteem. While debates about the word's use continue, it remains a powerful symbol, especially in the face of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and backlash against inclusivity.</p>

Ofgem's review found that suppliers fell short of required standards in treating vulnerable customers, leading to the suspension of forced installations.

The move aims to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record highs in the UK, but some customers say they will avoid using self-checkouts due to the new system.

          <p>Planned Parenthood has ceased abortions in Missouri after the state's Supreme Court ordered new rulings on a ban previously struck down by voters. The court determined that a district judge used an incorrect standard when allowing abortions to resume, emphasizing the need to consider potential harms from allowing abortions. Attorney General Andrew Bailey stated that the ruling is a win for women and children, ensuring abortion providers comply with safety requirements. Planned Parenthood, which operates the state's only abortion clinics, has begun canceling appointments and expressed frustration over political interference.</p>

          <p>China has significantly increased its naval and coast guard presence in East Asian waters, deploying larger-than-usual fleets near Taiwan, southern Japanese islands, and the East and South China Seas, according to security officials and documents. The increased activity includes guided-missile frigates, destroyers, and coast guard boats, as well as aircraft carrier groups. This flexing of military muscle is seen as an effort to exert pressure on the first island chain and reinforce China's dominance in its home waters. Japan has expressed concern, while the Philippines has criticized China's illegal presence in its maritime zones.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has backed a report by the London Drugs Commission advocating for the decriminalisation of possessing small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The report recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act and calls for reforms in education, healthcare, and policing. Lord Falconer, who chaired the commission, argued that the current law is disproportionate and contributes to racial disparities in stop and search practices. While the Metropolitan Police Commissioner acknowledged that any change to the law is a matter for parliament, critics argue that decriminalisation would send the wrong message about the harms of cannabis.</p>
