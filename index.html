          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 13:50:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>March saw a significant drop in sales of previously owned homes, falling 5.9% from February to an annualized rate of 4.02 million units, marking the slowest March since 2009. This decline is attributed to higher mortgage rates and broader economic concerns, impacting the spring housing market. Despite a nearly 20% increase in available listings compared to the previous year, affordability challenges continue to hinder home buying, with sales slumping across all regions, particularly in the West, indicating a potential slowdown in economic mobility.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that the added politeness of saying 'please' and 'thank you' to AI chatbots incurs a tangible cost in electricity and server usage. While it may seem trivial, the cumulative effect of millions of users adding these extra words to their prompts amounts to tens of millions of dollars. Every request to a chatbot requires energy, and each additional word increases the cost, highlighting the resource-intensive nature of AI interactions and the surprising impact of user behavior on operational expenses.</p>

          <p>Maurine Gentis, a 77-year-old retired teacher reliant on Meals on Wheels in South Texas, expresses concerns over potential program cuts due to the Trump administration's dismantling of the agency overseeing such services. The administration's overhaul of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has led to staff layoffs and office closures, raising fears that vital programs for the elderly and disabled may be affected. Gentis, who depends on the program for meals, books, and companionship, worries about the future of this crucial support system amid the changes and funding cuts, which are a result of Trump's executive orders to end what he termed “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring investments in companies involved in mining and processing critical minerals to reduce U.S. dependence on imports from countries like China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. The plan involves potential equity investments through a sovereign wealth fund and sovereign risk insurance to protect companies from political changes. This strategy aims to counter China's dominance in the mineral market, which Burgum says is achieved through dumping and state capital investments, and to ensure a stable supply chain for key industries like defense, energy, and automobiles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge partially blocked the Trump administration's effort to restrict federal funding to schools based on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, citing concerns about academic freedom and foundational principles. Judge Landya McCafferty argued that the administration's attempt to condition funding on eliminating DEI policies erodes the principles that distinguish the United States from totalitarian regimes. The injunction, however, is limited to entities employing or contacting specific groups that filed the lawsuit.</p>

          <h2>Judge Limits Trump's Authority to Withhold School Funds Over DEI</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has limited the Trump administration's power to withhold federal funds from schools with certain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The judge stated that the administration's definition of DEI was not sufficiently detailed and that the policy threatened free speech while exceeding the executive branch's legal authority. The decision follows the administration's demand that state education agencies attest that their schools do not use DEI practices that violate President Trump's interpretation of civil rights law.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is closely monitoring the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on U.K. economic growth, particularly if they lead to a slowdown in global trade, according to Governor Andrew Bailey. The central bank will consider the effects of tariffs on both growth and inflation at its upcoming monetary policy meeting. While acknowledging weak growth, Bailey stated that the U.K. is not currently close to a recession, but that economic uncertainty is affecting business and consumer confidence.</p>
