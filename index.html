          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns related to insufficient vetting processes. The policy also partially restricts entrance for nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela, with considerations including information-sharing policies and visa overstay rates. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the ban as discriminatory, while the administration maintains it is necessary to protect national security, and certain travelers, including U.S. permanent residents and athletes, are exempted from the restrictions. The new policy applies to foreigners from the named countries who are outside of the United States and who lack visas to enter as of Monday, June 9.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether Joe Biden's aides conspired to conceal Biden's cognitive decline by using an autopen to sign presidential documents. Trump claims Biden's advisors restricted his media appearances and scripted conversations to cover up his inability to perform his duties, pointing to the over 1,200 Presidential documents issued and numerous pardons granted during Biden's presidency. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's aides purposefully shielded the public from information about his mental and physical health and unconstitutionally exercised presidential authority. Comer said last week he was "open" to dragging Biden before the House to answer questions about the matter if necessary.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered an immediate ban on new international students and exchange visitors at Harvard University, citing national security threats. The proclamation orders the State Department to review whether current foreign enrollments should have their visas revoked, with the action effective immediately for at least six months. The administration accuses Harvard of maintaining links with foreign countries, particularly China, posing a national security threat to the U.S., and this move is expected to further strain relations between the U.S. and China. Harvard has responded, calling Trump's proclamation "yet another illegal retaliatory step."</p>

The "Humboldt Project" involves building a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, and aims to improve connectivity and provide a faster alternative to existing routes. Google is investing between $300 million and $550 million in the project, with the Chilean government contributing $25 million.

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 Lion Air crash has criticized a deal between Boeing and the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) as "morally repugnant." The deal, which includes Boeing paying $444.5 million to families and $455 million towards compliance improvements, aims to avoid prosecution over two fatal 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people. The lawyer argues the payout is insufficient and allows Boeing to "sidestep true criminal accountability," while Boeing asserts its commitment to fulfilling obligations under the resolution. The victims' families will have the chance to appeal the deal when it is considered by a federal judge.</p>

The referendum, put to the people after a grassroots organization gathered half a million signatures, is a rare chance to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent amid tightening citizenship rules. Prime Minister Meloni and other high-profile ministers are encouraging citizens to skip the vote, hoping for low turnout and failure to reach quorum.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the suspect accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The order prevents the removal of Soliman's family from the country or the state, and a hearing is scheduled for June 13. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives violates democratic justice system foundations, and Stephen Miller, the White House's top immigration advisor, had previously discussed suspending the right to petition for habeas corpus for immigrants. Soliman's family is being held in an immigration detention center in Texas.</p>

Somalia, on the other hand, has pledged to work with Washington on security issues following the ban.

The move has drawn criticism from international aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations, who argue it sows division and vilifies communities seeking safety in the United States.</p>

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the U.S. proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its soil. President Trump has asserted that the agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium, which appears to contradict the position of his negotiators.

The development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was a critical feature of bird evolution.

Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review determined it was safe and effective. Since its approval, mifepristone has been taken by more than 5 million patients, and medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023.</p>
