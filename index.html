          <p>During a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, President Trump raised concerns about a purported "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa, a claim denied by Ramaphosa and South African courts. Trump presented a video showing opposition politicians singing apartheid-era songs and drone footage of Afrikaner graves, which he alleged were evidence of the persecution. Ramaphosa countered that the majority of crime victims in South Africa are Black and included white members in his delegation to demonstrate inclusivity. The White House later released a statement doubling down on the unfounded claims of genocide, citing articles from Fox News and Breitbart. </p>

          <p>Despite inflation concerns, there are ways to save money on summer vacation, including deals on airfares and lower hotel room rates. Bookings are down slightly compared with one year ago, which is resulting in deals on airfares. While travel costs overall are down 2% compared with Memorial Day weekend a year ago, the cost of vacation-related activities is up. It is advised to be flexible about when you travel and where you go to score deals on airfare. </p>

          <p>Irwin, a pet kangaroo in Durango, Colorado, was once again seen hopping through town, marking his second escape. Police officers had to devise a new strategy to capture the more grown-up Irwin, after first catching him as a baby by luring him with a bag resembling a kangaroo pouch. Kangaroos are legal to own in Colorado, one of many exotic animals on an eclectic list. Irwin's confusion over his locale is understandable, as kangaroos are native to Australia. </p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republican hard-liners to negotiate a far-reaching tax and spending bill, facing opposition from members of the House Freedom Caucus who want additional spending cuts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add about $2.3 trillion to the US national debt over the next 10 years. The bill aims to extend tax cuts passed in 2017, eliminate taxes on tips, and increase spending on defense and border security. Democrats are uniformly opposed to the legislation. </p>

          <p>The FDA's new framework for COVID-19 vaccines, spearheaded by Vinay Prasad and Marty Makary, may restrict access to initial COVID vaccine series for healthy children. The agency will no longer approve new formulations for healthy individuals under 65 without new clinical trial data. Experts worry this policy could prevent most American children from accessing their initial series of COVID vaccines. Although children are less afflicted by severe COVID, they are still vulnerable to long COVID and severe disease, and the vaccines are safe and can lower that risk. </p>
